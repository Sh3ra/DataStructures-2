Redruth RFC
Redruth RFC established 1875 is a rugby union team from the town of Redruth Cornwall currently playing in the fourth tier of the English league system National League 2 South The club runs a number of mens teams including 1st XV National League 2 South 2nd XV Duchy League Colts and a Select XV as well as a number of junior teams from age 7 through to 16 They are one of the most successful club sides in Cornwall having won the Cornwall Cup 10 times and the Cornwall Super Cup 3 times and are currently the second highest ranked club side behind the Cornish Pirates Redruth enjoys a strong a rivalry with neighbours Camborne with the two clubs meeting annually in what is the worlds longest enduring rugby fixture

Redruth RFC was founded in 1875 by Henry Grylls and W H Willimot By the 1900s the club was the most successful in Cornwall a position they were to hold for much of the 20th century In the 1930s the team moved to the Recreation Ground near Plain an Gwary At the time the Recreation Ground was the third largest rugby ground in England When the leagues started in 1987 Redruth was in the provincial league of SouthWest 1 which they won The team then won the old League Four South in 1991 and gained promotion In 2005 the club reached its highestever ranking by winning promotion into National Division One The team finished 4th position in the 200607 season

The Recreation Ground is situated on Cardrew Lane in Redruth around five minutes walk from the town centre and Redruth railway station The ground consists of a main pitch with a wooden grandstand alongside the clubhouse on the west side and terraced grass banking on the other three sides The ground also has several bars adjoining the grandstand and there is also a secondary pitch for 2nd XV and junior fixtures There is parking for around 100 cars but this is often limited on matchdays and it is recommended that supporters park nearby in town 

The capacity of the Recreation Ground has varied over the decades Up until the 1980s it was considered the third largest rugby ground in England behind Twickenham and Leicester Tigers home of Welford Road with an official capacity of 21172 which included a number of temporary stands This capacity was actually exceeded in 1969 when the ground hosted the final of the County Championship between Cornwall and Lancashire when 25000 are believed to have watched the game 

The removal of the temporary stands coupled with a more zealous approach to safety saw the grounds capacity reduce to 12000 in the 1990s to the current capacity 2018 of around 3500 This modern figure includes 580 seated in the grandstand the rest standing with approximately 1500 on the east bank 800 on the north bank 400 on the south bank and a further 200 or so in front of the grandstandnext to club house In 2018 the local police gave an estimate of 3000 but since Redruth were reported to have achieved an attendance of 4000 for a National 2 promotion playoff game as recently as 2005 this is a little conservative

As one of the traditional rugby powerhouses in Cornwall Redruth are also one of the best supported second only to the Cornish Pirates and despite mixed fortunes over the past decade they remain the best supported club in National League 2 South having topped the attendance charts every year since they arrived in the division during the 201112 season Although the Recreation Ground no longer sees the huge crowds of yesteryear even for Cornwall games the 4000 that attended Redruths playoff victory against Macclesfield remains the clubs best crowd for a competitive fixture over the past couple of decades The club also still draws large crowds 1000 for the traditional yearly fixture against neighbours Camborne

Below is a summary of the clubs league attendance since the 200001 season The club enjoyed its best crowds during the 200809 season in the old National Division Two thanks to derby games against fellow Cornish clubs Launceston and Mounts Bay both of which drew crowds in excess of 2000 In recent years attendances at the Recreation Ground have fallen as the club has found itself without a Cornish league derby following the relegation of Launceston at the end of the 201516 season 

Below is a summary of Redruths performances in competitive rugby since the advent of the leagues in 198788


The colts section is coached by Simon Blake The team has consistently finished highly in the national Colts competition and won the U17s cup and U18s Cornwall Cup competitions in 2009

Women in the Russian and Soviet military
Women in the Russian and Soviet military have played many roles in their countrys military history Women of Russia and the Soviet Union played an important role in World Wars especially during World War II

Women served in the Russian armed forces in small numbers in the early stages of the war but their numbers increased after heavy Russian losses such as at the Battle of Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes and a need for increased manpower One such recruit was Maria Bochkareva who served with the 25th Reserve Battalion of the Russian Army After the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia in March 1917 she convinced interim prime minister Alexander Kerensky to let her form a womens battalion The Womens Battalion recruited women between the ages of 13 and 25 and appealed for support in a series of public meetings enlisting approximately 2000 soldiers The Battalion fought during the June Offensive against German forces in 1917 Three months of fighting reduced their numbers to around twohundred and fifty

The Womens Battalion was disbanded after a failed military coup known as the Kornilov Affair Its leader General Lavr Kornilov had been strongly supported by Bachkarova and the Womens Battalion were identified as potential sympathizers The majority of the battalions members were reformed as the First Petrograd Womens Battalion This group was at the Winter Palace on the night of the Bolshevik Revolution along with an untrained cadet detachment and a bicycle regiment They mounted a resistance but ultimately fell although there were only 5 deaths in the storming of the Winter Palace The triumphant Bolsheviks officially disbanded the group 

Several women pilots are known from the First World War Princess Eugenie Shakovskaya was assigned duty as an artillery and reconnaissance pilot having volunteered for the Imperial Russian Air Service in 1914 one of the worlds first female military aviators and flew missions with the 26th Corps Air Squadron in 1917 for nine months Because of her connections to the Imperial family she was demobilized after the October Revolution Lyubov A Golanchikova was a test pilot who contributed her airplane to the Czarist armies Helen P Samsonova was assigned to the 5th Corps Air Squadron as a reconnaissance pilot And in 1915 Nedeshda Degtereva had the distinction of being the first woman pilot to be wounded in combat while on a reconnaissance mission over the Austrian front in Galicia

Women played a part in most of the armed forces of the Second World War In most countries though women tended to serve mostly in administrative medical and in auxiliary roles But in the Soviet Union women fought also in front line roles Over 800000 women served in the Soviet armed forces in World War II mostly as medics and nurses which is over 3 percent of total personnel nearly 200000 of them were decorated 89 of them eventually received the Soviet Unions highest award the Hero of the Soviet Union they served as pilots snipers machine gunners tank crew members and partisans as well as in auxiliary roles Few of these women however were promoted to officers 

For Soviet women aviators instrumental to this change was Marina Raskova a famous Russian aviator Raskova became a famous aviator as both a pilot and a navigator in the 1930s She was the first woman to become a navigator in the Soviet Air Force in 1933 Raskova is credited with using her personal connections with Joseph Stalin to convince the military to form three combat regiments for women The Soviet Union was the first nation to allow women pilots to fly combat missions These regiments with strength of almost hundred airwomen flew a combined total of more than 30000 combat sorties produced over twenty Heroes of the Soviet Union and included two fighter aces This military unit was initially called Aviation Group 122 while the three regiments received training After their training the three regiments received their formal designations as the 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment and the 588th Night Bomber Regiment Two of the units were honored with the Guards designation and renamed

The Soviet Union also used women for sniping duties and to good effect including Nina Alexeyevna Lobkovskaya and Ukrainian Lyudmila Pavlichenko who killed over 300 enemy soldiers The Soviets found that sniper duties fit women well since good snipers are patient careful deliberate and should avoid tactical handtohand combat Women served also in noncombat roles as medics nurses communication personnel political officers as well  in small numbers  as machine gunners tank drivers Manshuk Mametova was a machine gunner from Kazakhstan and was the first Asian woman to receive the title Hero of the Soviet Union after she refused to retreat with the rest of her regiment

Women constituted significant numbers of the Soviet partisans One of the most famous was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya who was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 16 February 1942 

The youngest woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union was also a resistance fighter Zinaida Portnova

After the war most women left the armed forces Those that stayed to make a career in the postwar armed forces saw old attitudes return and promotion and opportunities more difficult Also some military academies closed their doors to women despite the supposed official policy of equality In 1967 the Russian Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available soldiers during periods of large scale mobilisation Thus several programs during the height of the Cold War were set up to encourage women to enlist Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for exservicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves especially for doctors But some roles open to women during the war were later barred

Women have had the legal right to serve in the Russian Armed Forces throughout the post Cold War period In 2002 10 of the Russian armed forces 100000 of a total active strength of 988100 were women

Ballylaneen
Ballylaneen  previously spelt as Baile U Laithn is a small village in County Waterford Ireland approximately halfway between the villages of Kilmacthomas and Bunmahon on a hill by the River Mahon

The village features a Catholic church St Annes built in 1824 a public house a now closed shopgarage and about seven dwelling houses It also has St Annes Holy Well where people are said to have gone to pray for cures in the past enclosed by a wall in 1974 The village was larger in the 19th century and gave its name to a parish of its own which was administered from Mothel Today Ballylaneen is part of Stradbally parish The ruins of a large mill can be seen on the river Mahon east of the village This was one of five mills which were sited on the river Mahon The other four were at Mahonbridge one and Kilmacthomas three The present village is actually situated in the townland of Carrigcastle while the old school and old graveyard are located in the townland of Ballylaneen

There are two graveyards associated with the village The newer of the two adjacent to St Annes church has one grave of interest a flat horizontal tombstone commemorating Mark Anthony of Carrigcastle 1786  1 June 1867 who was an officer in the British Royal Navy and served in the battle of Trafalgar The old graveyard rarely used nowadays is outside the present village on the Kilmacthomas road It is the burial place of the poet Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin see below Half a mile to the west of the village is an ancient stonewalled circular enclosure called Cathair Breac on a hill overlooking the village On another hill southwest of the village in Carrigcastle there is a subterranean neolithic corbelroofed chamber which was unearthed in the early 1970s

The village had its own primary school originally established under the British National School system It was closed down in the 1950s after which most of the pupils from the area attended Seafield near Bunmahon The old school building is still standing adjacent to the old graveyard and was recently refurbished as a holiday home 

The bestknown teacher at the National School was the Gaelic scholar Tom Walsh Tomas Breathnach around 1910 While he taught there promising children from other school catchment areas attended including John Kiely of Stradbally later FRCSI and David Hill of Kilmacthomas later MPSI Tom Walsh translated the Latin inscription composed by Donncha Rua mac Conmara to Gaelic on the tombstone of Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin 

Walsh was succeeded by Tom Cashin NT who taught in Ballylaneen until the schools closure who features in accounts of the disappearance of Larry Griffin the missing postman from Kilmacthomas 1929

The name Ballylaneen appears in a book title The Road From Ballylaneen to Skellig Michael by English writer Michael White being randomly chosen for its good phonetic sound and its location near the south coast

The old graveyard in Ballylaneen is the burial place of the famous Munster poet and religious writer Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin His tombstone is a flat upright monument with a curved top and a Latin inscription on the front Its located a few metres from the gable end of the old National School building The Latin epitaph was composed by the poet Donncha Rua mac Conmara buried in Newtown 4 miles away who was a friend of his The Irish translation on the black plastic plaque shown right was done by Tom Walsh Tomas Breatnac the teacher in the old National School in the early 1900s Tadhg Gaelach  Silleabhin Timothy OSullivan was born in Tuar na Fola Tournafulla Co Limerick around 1715 He moved first to Cork where he lived for about 30 years and later to Co Waterford and died in Waterford city in 1795 His writings include Timothy OSullivans Pious Miscellany published in English in 1802 in Clonmel his work was originally written and published in Irish while he was alive His works were published again in Gaelic in 1868 by John ODaly Publishers 9 Anglesea St Dublin see reprint at httpsarchiveorgstreampiousmiscellanyo00suoftpagen3mode2up and there is considerable information in the preface written ODaly although ODalys account of Tadhg Gaelachs dates and birthplace are now agreed to be incorrect Up to the time of his death Tadhg Gaelach was admired and possibly sometimes looked after by a relatively prosperous local catholic farming family the OCallaghans He was also a frequent guest of Ballylaneen Parish Priest Rev Richard Morrissey who is most likely to be responsible for Tadhgs being buried here Other patrons of his included an OPhelan Faolin family of the Decies and one of his songs is written in their honour Do Seoirse agus Domhnall  Faoilin to be sung to the air of Bonny Jane see httpsarchiveorgstreampiousmiscellanyo00suoftpage82mode2up Tadhg Gaelachs hymns were published by an tAthair Pdraig Ua Duinnnin in Dublin in 1903

In 2010 AOIKyrgyzstan a Kyrgyz subsidiary of Alliance One International Inc a global tobacco leaf merchant headquartered in North Carolina United States pleaded guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA relating to bribes paid to Kyrgyzstan government officials in connection with its purchase of Kyrgyz tobacco

Alliance One was formed from a merger between Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation in 2005 AOIKyrgyzstan admitted that employees of Dimons Kyrgyz subsidiary paid a total of approximately US3 million in bribes from 1996 to 2004 to various officials in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan including officials of the Kyrgyz Tamekisi a government entity that controlled and regulated the tobacco industry in Kyrgyzstan Bribes totalling US254262 were made to five local provincial government officials known as Akims to obtain permission to purchase tobacco from local growers during the same period

There was also significant incidence of child labor in the tobacco industry In fact the 2013 US Department of Labor report on the worst forms of child labor indicated that 45 of children aged 5 to 14 were engaged in such working conditions in tobacco cultivation and that despite the availability of education evidence suggested that a limited number of schools required children to harvest tobacco on school grounds Despite adopting an action plan for the National Program against Human Trafficking for 20132016 interagency coordination on child labor continued to be poor according to the report More recently in December 2014 the Departments List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor reported tobacco as a good still produced by Kyrgyz children among others To tobacco the list added cotton the cultivation of which was determined by national law as hazardous

The organic movement began in Kyrgyzstan in 2004 At that time 34 pioneer farmers were engaged in it Today Bio Farmer unites more than a thousand certified farmers and offers organic products such as cotton sunflower seeds beans medical and aromatic plants and dried apricots According to experts organic farming is most suitable to countries with generally small farms cheap labor and a shortage of capital Thus organic farming may become Kyrgyzstans perfect future In fact the Kyrgyzstan Parliament just announced a plan to phase out all nonorganic farming and switch to 100 organic agriculture by 2028

Hibbertia dentata
Hibbertia dentata commonly known as toothed guinea flower trailing guinea flower or twining guinea flower is an ornamental plant in the family Dilleniaceae native to the east coast of Australia Found in woodland it is a trailing or twining vine with leaves with several small teeth on the margins and bright yellow flowers in early spring It adapts readily to cultivation and can be grown as a pot plant The species was first described in 1817

Hibbertia dentata was first formally described in 1817 in Regni Vegetabilis Systema Naturale of Augustin Pyramus de Candolle by the prolific botanist Robert Brown The species name is the Latin adjective dentata toothed referring to the toothed leaf margins George Bentham classified it in the series Hemihibbertiae based on flower anatomy defining members of the group having glabrous carpels and numerous stamens

Hibbertia dentata grows as a twining vine the stems of which can be up to in length and trail over rocks and other shrubs The dark green leaves are ovate measuring long by wide and sit on 1cm long petioles The apex of the leaf blade can be pointed or blunt while the leaf margins are toothed They can be purpletinged and covered in fur when young and smooth upon reaching maturity The flowers appear mainly from July to November They arise from axillary buds or on the ends of short stems They have five petals that are long each and over 30 stamens The flowers generally wither within a day or two The fruit is mature over November to January splitting to release the seeds

Hibbertia dentata occurs in open forest or on the edge of rainforest along the east coast and hinterlands of New South Wales extending into southeastern Queensland and eastern Victoria Associated forest species in the Sydney region include mountain grey gum Eucalyptus cypellocarpa Sydney peppermint E piperita messmate E obliqua Sydney red gum Angophora costata turpentine Syncarpia glomulifera and scrub species such as coastal tea tree Leptospermum laevigatum Within this habitat it is found on sheltered slopes in areas with good drainage on clay shale or sandstonebased soils that are high in nutrients

Hibbertia dentata can resprout after bushfire from its roots and flower within ten months Seedlings have also been recorded in this time frame

The flowers are visited by European honeybees native shorttongue bees of the families Halictidae and Colletidae and large hoverflies of the genus Melangyna

Although not often seen in cultivation Hibbertia dentata is an easy plant to grow in the garden and more shadetolerant than the widely cultivated H scandens Though fair drainage is required the plant suffers if allowed to dry out and hence needs to be kept moist It grows well as a pot plant It was brought into cultivation in England in 1814 In 1817 it was described in the Loddiges periodical The Botanical Cabinet as being a fine subject for planting out in a conservatory

Propagation is relatively easy by cuttings of mature material and seedlings may spontaneously arise in gardens where it is established

We are in the early stages of a recovery and at this time it is important not to weaken burgeoning confidence and to lay the foundations of a sustainable recovery Van Rompuy said in a speech to parliament in Brussels Most important is to keep the direction That will also provide stability and support

Gordon Brown also praised Van Rompuy as a consensusbuilder who had brought a period of political stability to his country after months of uncertainty This opinion is shared by others he has been described as the painstaking builder of impossible compromises lhorloger des compromis impossibles A statement made by Van Rompuy at a news conference after his selection illustrates his approach 

Being proeurope not all parties and fractions had positive words for Van Rompuy when he took office Nigel Farage attacked the freshly appointed president by saying  you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low grade bank clerk He was fined 3000 Euros ten days pay for this by the Bureau of the European Parliament These comments were a manifestation of the frustration of lack of democratic process in the appointment of Van Rompuy to presidency

In a November 2009 press conference Van Rompuy related to global governance by stating 2009 is also the first year of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle of a financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet Van Rompuy referred to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009

In fact the meeting was in part taken over by the growing sovereign debt crisis at that time Greece which was to become the hall mark of Van Rompuys first two years as President With EU member states holding divergent positions on this issue he had to find compromises not least between France and Germany at subsequent European Council meetings and summits of Eurozone heads of state or government leading to the establishment of the threeyear European Financial Stability Mechanism EFSMand the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF in May 2010 to provide loans to Greece and later Ireland and Portugal to help stabilise their borrowing costs but subject to strict conditions
The European Council also gave him the assignment of chairing a task force on economic governance composed of personal representatives mostly ministers of finance of the heads of government which reported ahead of schedule to the October 2010 European Council Its report which proposed stronger macroeconomic coordination within the EU in general and the Eurozone in particular and also a tightening of the Stability and Growth Pact was endorsed by the European Council The latter also charged him with preparing by December 2010 a proposal for a limited change to the Treaty required to enable a more permanent financial stability mechanism His draft  for an addition to Article 136 TFEU pertaining to the Eurozone  was endorsed by the European Council at its October 2010 meeting
His second year in office 2011 was also marked by a deterioration of the Greek debt crisis leading to Van Rompuy calling an extraordinary meeting of the Eurozone heads of state or government in July to adopt a first package of further measures notably longer term loans at lower interest rates private sector debtwritedown further fiscal consolidation in Greece and again in October in conjunction with full European Council meetings to contain contagion from Greece to other countries through bank recapitalisation across Europe and by leveraging the firepower of the EFSF to about 1 trillion

His first two years were also marked by his role in coordinating European positions on the world stage at G8 and G20 summits and bilateral summits such as the tense 5 October 2010 EUChina summit He called a special European Council at short notice in early 2011 on the emerging Libya crisis which in agreeing conditions for military intervention made it impossible for Germany to oppose such intervention once the conditions were fulfilled

On 1 March 2012 Herman Van Rompuy was reelected unanimously as President of the European Council by the heads of state or government of the 28 EU member states President Van Rompuys second term has lasted for two and a half years from 1 June 2012 to 30 November 2014 After this second mandate he could not have been reelected because the European Council Presidents term of office can only be extended once

Herman Van Rompuy was also appointed as the first President of the Euro Summit and this for the same term of office as his Presidency of the European Council The Euro Summit meetings are to take place at least twice a year

In 2014 Van Rompuy was awarded the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for his EU role

When the EPP membership of Hungarian party Fidesz was suspended in 2019 EPP president Joseph Daul appointed van Rompuy  alongside HansGert Pttering and Wolfgang Schssel  to a group of highlevel experts who were mandated to monitor Fideszs compliance with EPP values







Although the European Council is under the terms of the Lisbon treaty a separate institution of the EU it does not have its own administration The administrative support for both the European Council and its president is provided by the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union

The president does have however his own private office cabinet of close advisers Van Rompuy chose as his chief of staff chef de cabinet Baron Frans van Daele formerly Belgian ambassador to variously the USA the UN the EU and NATO and chief of staff of several Belgian foreign ministers Also in his team are the former UK Labour MEP Richard Corbett former Hungarian Ambassador to NATO Zoltan Martinusz former head of the EUs economic  financial committee Odile RenaudBasso Luuk van Middelaar his main speech writer and Van Rompuys long standing press officer Dirk De Backer

Thomas Madiou
Thomas Madiou 30 April 1814  1884 was a Haitian historian His work Histoire dHati English History of Haiti is the first complete history of Haiti from 1492 to 1846 Madious present It is considered one of the most valuable documents of Haitian history and literature

Born in PortauPrince to fairly affluent parents Madiou left Haiti at the age ten to study in France at the Royal College of Angers Collge Royal dAngers He later studied in Rennes France and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Letters there He then attended the Law School of Paris for two years before returning to Haiti During his time in France Madiou met Isaac Louverture the son of Haitis revolutionary hero Toussaint Louverture This encounter supposedly sparked Madious interest in his countrys past and he returned to Haiti with the intention to write its history Over a decade later Madiou published three volumes covering Haitis history from 1492 to 1807 with the PortauPrince publisher J Courtois A fourth volume 184346 appeared as part of Haitis centennial in 1904 150 years after the texts initial printing the Haitian publishing house Henri Deschamps published the complete history eight volumes spanning 1492 to 1846

In Histoire dHati Madiou continued the work of earlier Haitian authors to combat racialized portrayals of Haitis past in particular the countrys founding He saw himself filling a crucial void by writing the first complete national history by a Haitian author The history was valuable not only for Haitians but all members of the African Diaspora To construct his multivolume history Madiou relied heavily upon French written sources however he also recognized the importance of oral histories as a supplement to the written archive He interviewed aging revolutionary veterans during his travels across the country with General Joseph Balthazar Inginac the secretarygeneral for Haitis longest serving nineteenthcentury president JeanPierre Boyer His history tried to repair the reputation of the black leaders of the Haitian Revolution especially Toussaint Louverture portraying the struggle as a justified rebellion against the terrible oppression of slavery This placed his work in contrast to the history written by Beaubrun Ardouin appearing a few years after Madious which tried to place the Haitian Revolution in the context of the other independence struggles in Latin America and deny it a class or racial character Ardouin was trying to make Haiti fit into the community of nations in the Americas in the 1830s while Madiou was stressing what made Haiti unique

In addition to his writing Madiou served in various government positions including director of the national high school and minister plenipotentiary to Spain He also worked as Director of Le Moniteur the official government publication and was a contributor to Haitis small but vibrant press

Faretta v California
Faretta v California 422 US 806 1975 was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that criminal defendants have a constitutional right to refuse counsel and represent themselves in state criminal proceedings

The defendant Anthony Faretta was accused of grand theft in Los Angeles County California Well before the trial began the defendant requested permission to represent himself Questioning by the judge revealed that he had once represented himself in a criminal case and that he believed that the public defenders office was under a heavy case load The judge warned him that he was making a mistake and emphasized that he would receive no special treatment The judge entered a preliminary ruling allowing Faretta to represent himself however stating that he might reverse his decision if it seemed that he was unable to adequately represent himself

Several weeks later but still before the trial the judge initiated a hearing to inquire into Farettas ability to defend himself After questioning him on numerous topics including hearsay and juries the judge ruled that his answers were inadequate and he had not made an intelligent decision to waive counsel In addition he ruled that Faretta had no constitutional right to his own defense Therefore he rescinded his previous decision During the trial the judge denied Farettas motions to be cocounsel and other motions he attempted to make on his behalf Subsequently he was convicted by a jury and sentenced to life in prison

The California Court of Appeal which relied on a recent California Supreme Court decision that had expressly decided the issue ruled that Faretta had no federal or state right to represent himself Appeal to the Supreme Court of California was denied

In the opinion of the court by Justice Stewart the Court held that a defendant in a state criminal trial has the constitutional right to refuse appointed counsel and conduct the trial when he or she voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so However such a defendant may not later complain that he received ineffective assistance of counsel The court brought analogies to the Star Chamber saying the Star Chamber has for centuries symbolized disregard of basic individual rights The Star Chamber not merely allowed but required defendants to have counsel The defendants answer to an indictment was not accepted unless it was signed by counsel When counsel refused to sign the answer for whatever reason the defendant was considered to have confessed

Justice Blackmun wrote a dissent where he questioned the additional procedural problems that would inevitably arise by the decision arguing that such procedural problems would far outweigh whatever tactical advantage the defendant may feel he has gained by electing to represent himself Blackmun concludes with the following If there is any truth to the old proverb one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client the Court by its opinion today now bestows a constitutional right on one to make a fool of himself

AnNisa 34
AnNisa 34 also known as Quran 434 is the 34th verse of chapter surah 4 of the Quran titled AnNisaThe Women

There are a number of translations that differ on the specific interpretations of the words

Marmaduke Pickthall

Muhammad Taqi Usmani

Abdullah Yusuf Ali

Sahih International at Qurancom

Ahmad Shafaat

Muhsin Khan at Qurancom

Muhammad TahirulQadri

Laleh Bakhtiar PhD
Maulvi Sher Ali on behalf of the Ahmadiyya religion

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original and all vary to some extent Some Muslims such as Islamic feminist groups argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence

In the Prophets farewell sermon as recorded in alTabaris History and similarly in a hadith collected by Abu Dawud he instructed husbands to beat their wives but not severely     fadribuhunna darban ghayra mubarrih literal translation beat them a beating without severity if their wives commit an immorality or adultery in the husbands absence according to the cited farewell address sermon in alTabaris history for a wife to allow someone a husband dislikes to tread on his bed means to commit sexual indecencies in the absence of the husband This is obtained not only from the context of the sermon and the hadith cited but also from the cited Cliff Note 772 in Vol IX of AlTabaris history Ibn Abbas a companion of the Prophet is recorded in the Tafsir of alTabari for verse 434 as saying that beating without severity is using a siwak small tooth cleaning twig or a similar object There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it In a hadith collected by Abu Dawud Muhammad told men not to hit their wives on the face

Another hadith narration of the Farewell Sermon appears in Sunan Ibn Majah The Arabic phrase mentioned above is here translated hit them but without causing injury or leaving a mark

In his ArabicEnglish Lexicon Edward William Lane notes various definitions for the Arabic word Lahada such as Lahada means push which appears in the first hadith and is rendered as he struck in the English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui

There have been several fatwas against domestic violence Feminist writers have argued that society during Quranic times differed from modern times especially in how children were reared and raised creating a need for gender roles However these scholars highlight that the Quran can be interpreted differently as society changes

Jonathan AC Brown gives the wider scholarly tendency when it comes to the verse

The first part of the verse about men having authority over women is meant for obedience towards God not the husband

The Quran states that men are the guardians of women and thus responsible for earning livelihood for the family and female relatives Women however are given a degree of autonomy over their own income and property provided this autonomy is exercised in a way that is agreeable to the wishes of the husband provided his wishes not be in violation of Islamic principles Nevertheless they are responsible for educating the children as God has given the one preference over the other Man is also considered to be the head of the family The Quran recommends that wives be obedient and adaptable to their husbands Wives should also keep the secrets of their husbands and protect their honor and integrity Islamic scholars consider this important in running a smooth family system

For both men and women zulm known in English as actions of cruelty against someone is explicitly prohibited

The equality of men and women is discussed in many places throughout the text The Quran blamed Adam and Eve for the original sin as Satan talks to both of them
The Quran is also very specific that both men and women should receive equal punishment for wrongdoings 242 and that both men and women are seen as equals under God and will be rewarded for their faith by entering Heaven 4124

In her book Quran and Women scholar Amina Wadud writes about the importance of women in the time of the Prophet During this time women did not have access to the technology that women today have giving birth and raising children was much more difficult due to diseases and lack of healthcare knowledge For this reason Wadud writes The Quran establishes his the husbands responsibility as qiwamah seeing to it that the women is not burdened with additional responsibilities which jeopardize that primary demanding responsibility only she can fulfill The need to reproduce and raise children contributed to the importance of gender roles in the time of the Prophet

Scholar Ayesha Chaudhry writes that many Muslims have this fundamentally flawed way of examining the text writing that Despite the potential for such verses 434 to have multiple plainsense meanings living Muslim communities place these interpretations in conversation with the precolonial Islamic tradition

The late Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad Hussein Tabatabai 19031981 AD provides the following exegesis on 434 from both Sunni and Shiite sources in his MizanIbn Abi Hatim has narrated through Ashath ibn AbdilMalik from alHasan that he said A woman came to the Prophet complaining against her husband that he had slapped her The Messenger of Allah said Retribution Then Allah revealed the verse Men are maintainers of women 434 so the woman returned without retribution adDurr lmunthur asSuyuti asSuyuti has narrated it from the Prophet through other chains too Some of them say that the Messenger of Allah said I wanted one thing retribution but Allah decided otherwisethere were some instances where Allah had amended some prophetic orders by adding to or deleting from it but it was only in his administrative order not in matters of the law ordained by him for his people otherwise it would have been an invalid nullificationthe Messenger of Allah used to wonder aloud How can you embrace the woman with a hand you had hit her with It is narrated also in alKafi through his chain from Abu Maryam from Abu Jafar Imam Muhammad alBaqir that he said The Messenger of Allah said What Does one of you hit his wife and then attempt to embrace her Countless such statements are found in the traditions and one may understand from them the Islamic views on this subjectAlTabari 839923 AD wrote that The Prophet never raised his hand against one of his wives or against a slave nor against any person at all In fact when the Prophet faced rebellion of his wives rather than beat him AlTabari accounts that he instead stayed away from his wives for 29 nights

In response to nushz admonishment leaving wives in their beds and idribihunna are permitted Islamic scholars agree such actions can not be undertaken for any reason other than those mentioned in the Quran see nushz

This allots men authority over women due to following reasons
1 Because God has given some more strength than others
2 Because men spent from their property to support women ie 
clothing residence and sustenanceThe word qawwamun is also used at AlQuran 4134 Here it is said that believers should be Qawwamun with fairness

One of the reason men being qawwamun over women is that God has favoured some over others

Second reason of men being qawwamun over women is that because men are responsible of earning for women

The verse declares that pious women are
1 Obedient
2 Guarding the unseen as God prescribes

The verse commands women to be qanitat The term has been used in to refer to men and women alike who are obedient to God Some commentators use the term to mean obedience to the husband while others assert that it means obedience to God Some scholars agree that the husband does not have absolute control over his wife and her first loyalty is to God

Hafizat is derived from hafaz meaning to guard The subjective form is hafiz meaning a person who guards and hafizah meaning she who guards feminine Hafizat is plural of hafizah both being feminine It means that good women guard themselves in the absence of Husband as God prescribes

And those whose rebellion nushz is feared It is advised
1 to admonish them
2 to leave them alone in beds
3 to beat them


The first response to nushuz is wz  meaning to first admonish or scold the wife of her behaviour There is strong agreement amongst Muslim scholars that this admonishment must be conducted in a spirit of reconciliation

According to tafsir ibn kathir a well known commentary of Quran He describes in his exegesis

Should the nushuz continue the next step is to refuse to share the bed with the wife Again Muslim scholars emphasize on the spirit of healing while conducting this action

According to tafsir ibn Kathir

The term iribhunna usually translated beat them in 434 comes from the root araba Arabic  The word has been used many times in the Quran to mean to hit to travel the earth to set up to condemn and to give examples Thus scholars interpret iribhunna in different ways Whereas many interpret it to mean to strike others hold that the term means to separate Such an action is to be administered only if neither the husband nor the wife are willing to divorce In the context of this verse iribhunna has also been interpreted to mean go to bed with them the Arabic root word daraba being taken from the prosaic example the studcamel covered the shecamel

The term daraba is translated by Yusuf Ali as beat but the Arabic word is used elsewhere in the Quran to convey different meanings The phrase Daraba Allah mathalan translates to Allah gives or sets an example The use of this word might be compared to the way to strike is used in English which can mean to strike a pose or to strike a bargain not just referring to the physical act of hitting something The use of daraba is also intentional because a different Arabic word exists daraba which is translated to to strike repeatedly or intensely

Muslim scholars who permit hitting emphasize that it must not be harsh but rather light Muslim men are never to hit their spouses face nor to hit them in such a way as would leave marks on their body Scholars suggest that the response administered should be in proportion to the fault committed Traditionally the idea of beating was with a toothbrush or with a folded handkerchief Jonathan AC Brown resumes the situationIf a wife exhibited egregious disobedience nushuz such as uncharacteristically insulting behavior leaving the house against the husbands will and without a valid excuse or denying her husband sex without medical grounds the husband should first admonish her to be conscious of God and proper etiquette If she did not desist from her behavior he should cease sleeping with her in their bed If she still continued in her nushuz he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a woundup handkerchief mina malfuf not a whip or stick All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment diya from the husband for any injury she sustained and Hanbalis the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done In effect any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking ones wife to a light blow that leaves no mark Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executedMany jurists interpret iribhunna as more or less symbolic Others however argue that a mere symbolic administration would be pointless and rather should be an energetic demonstration of the love of the husband But it is agreed that the demonstration should not seriously hurt the wife

The 2007 translation The Sublime Quran by Laleh Bakhtiar translates iribhunna not as beat them but as go away from them The introduction to her translation discusses the linguistic and shariah reasons in Arabic for understanding this verb in context The Prophet never beat his wives and his example from the Sunnah informs the interpretation of this verse This interpretation is supported by the fact that some other verses such as 4101 which contains word darabtum derivation from daraba demonstrate also the interpretation of Arabic word daraba to have meaning going or moving

The Islamic scholar TahirulQadri has given the same translation in his translation of the Quran IrfanulQuran and if they still do not improve turn away from them striking a temporary parting This translation is further supported by the fact that the word darabtum is used in the same chapter specifically in  which means to go abroad in the sake of Allah and which is derived from the same root word daraba as idribuhunna in 434

The book Woman in the Shade of Islam by Saudi scholar Abdul Rahman alSheha stated that a man may beat his wife only if it occurs without hurting breaking a bone leaving blue or black marks on the body and avoiding hitting the face at any cost

A widely used 1930 English translation of the Quran by British Muslim scholar Marmaduke Pickthall determined the verse to mean that as a last resort men can scourge their wives

Some jurists argue that even when hitting is acceptable under the Quran it is still discountenanced

In his book  University of Southern California scholar Reza Aslan stated that false interpretations of the text have occurred because Quranic commentary has been the exclusive domain of Muslim men

The Islamic prophet Mohammed himself according to Islamic tradition never once struck a woman in argument This fact is sometimes cited in debates about the text

Muslim feminist writer Asra Q Nomani has argued Feminist writer Amina Wadud writes in her book nowikinowikiInside the Gender Jihad Womens Reform in Islamnowikinowiki

Ibn Ishaq has said that Muhammad in his The Farewell Sermon said that

Nada Ibrahim of the University of South Australia states that three wordsqawwamuna nushuzahunna and wadribuhunnaare mistranslated due to the lack of equivalent English alternatives She explains that in particular English language Quran commentators have not agreed to merely one translation of the word wadribuhunna and that A clear disagreement exists among Englishlanguage Quran commentators on how best to translate this word All translations give an explicit negative connotation and  when read out of context  further exacerbates any misunderstanding

In qurans Commentary exegisis of this part of verse is as following
In this part of verse God says that if women obey then man are not allowed to make excuses against them

Ibn Kathir in the commentary of this part of verse says

It means that God is exalted
It means that God is great

Casimirs Code
The Casimirs Code   was a legal code adopted in 1468 by Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Casimir IV Jagiellon with an approval of the Lithuanian Council of Lords It was the first attempt to codify the laws of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania The code prescribed punishment for property crimes and limited court procedures Much of the legal system was left uncodified and was governed by customs

The date or the circumstances when the code was adopted are unknown The historians conjured that the most probable date is February 1468 when the Seimas of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania met in Vilnius The code differed from privileges previously issued by the Grand Duke because the code granted no new rights to the nobility Judging from the content the code was intended for the nobility and landowners who received Casimirs privilege in 1447 to try veldamai a class of dependent people that eventually became serfs The code attempted to impose some consistency in the treatment of veldamai The document also did not specify the effective date or territory Historians believe that the code was in effect in entire Lithuania up to the first Statute of Lithuania of 1529 even though no court cases are known that referenced the code

Written in the Ruthenian language the original document did not survive but several copies are known from the end of 15th and beginning of the 16th centuries The document was first published in 1826 by Ignacy Daniowicz law professor at Vilnius University The document did not have a proper name and was named Casimirs Code or Casimirs Statute by modern historians The original code was not divided into articles modern historians have identified 25 articles

The code prescribed various punishments for crimes and some court procedures It dealt only with crimes against property theft and robbery The code primarily dealt with common thieves but also addressed crimes by the Lithuanian nobility such as cutting forest trees without permission or luring away veldamai from another noble The nobility was to be tried and sentenced by the Grand Duke and the Council of Lords Civil disputes between nobles were to be decided by the thirdparty judges Peasants dependent on the Grand Duke were to be tried by tijnai highranking supervisors of royal estates while those dependent on other dukes and nobles  by the nobles themselves or their appointed officials

A criminal first had to compensate the victim for the material losses the stolen object was usually not returned to the victim but transferred to the court The code devoted special attention to this issue Then criminal was subject to the actual punishment There were four types of punishments the stolen object was confiscated for the benefit of the court if the object was not available it was replaced by other compensation of equal value flogging and putting into stocks hanging The death sentence was limited to repeated offenders thefts of cows and horses and other crimes that exceeded a certain monetary limit The responsibility for the crimes did not extend to family members unless they knew or participated in the theft

Francesco Rugeri
Francesco Rugeri Cremona 1628 28 October 1698 also known as Ruger Rugier Rugeri Ruggeri Ruggieri Ruggerius was the first of an important family of luthiers the Casa Rugeri in Cremona Italy His instruments are masterfully constructed His violins are inspired by Nicol Amatis Grand Amati pattern Francesco was the first to develop a smaller cello design which has become the standard for modern cello dimensions Today Rugeris instruments are nearly as renowned as Nicol Amatis instruments

He was perhaps the earliest apprentice of Nicol Amati another important luthier in Cremona Italy although other sources call this association into question as there is no census record showing his presence in the Amati household The lack of census records showing the Rugeri name may be explained by the possibility of Francesco not being an indoor apprentice but one who lived and boarded at his own home while apprenticing Antonio Stradivaris name never appears in the census records of the Amati household even though he was also a likely pupil of Nicol Amati and lived and boarded with his own family WE Hill  Sons also note that the unmistakable handiwork of Francesco Rugeri can be found in certain of Nicolo Amatis works and just like Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Guarneri Francesco from time to time included the words Alumnus Nicolai Amati on his labels further adding to evidence of his apprenticeship For example there exists a violin labelled Francescus Rugerius Alumnus Nicolai Amati fecit Cremon 1663 Nicol Amati was the godfather to Francescos son Giacinto indicating that the two families at least shared a close relationship and close collaboration would seem likely

In support of Rugeri being a pupil of Nicol Amati there is a court case brought in 1685 by a violinist who sought relief from the Duke of Modena as a victim of fraud In this case the violinist and composer Tomaso Antonio Vitali bought a violin purporting to be a creation of Nicol Amati Yet under the Amati label was the label of Francesco Rugeri There was a price difference in those days of 3 to 1 on Amati vs Rugeri violins so this was a serious matter However this case may also indicate that Rugeri who was working in the shadow of the great Cremona makersAmati Guarneri and Stradivariresorted to a desperate act to make a sale The result of the court case is not known but either scenario could prove valid

Some researchers believe there is a closer educational association between Antonio Stradivari and Francesco Rugeri than has previously been recognized Despite the longheld belief that Antonio Stradivari was the pupil of Nicol Amati there are important discrepancies between their work Some researchers believe early instruments by Stradivari bear a stronger resemblance to Francesco Rugeris work than Amatis Additionally the utilization of a small dorsal pin or small hole invariably used not just by Nicol Amati but all of his recognized pupilswith the exception of Antonio Stradivari adds further evidence that Stradivari may have learnt his craft apart from Amati This pin or hole was fundamental in the graduation of the thickness of the plates and was obviously a technique passed on through generations of pupils of the Amati This dorsal pin is also not found in any of the instruments of the Rugeri family suggesting Antonio Stradivari may have actually learnt his craft from Francesco Rugeri although both being influenced by Amati WE Hill  Sons concede that they fail to find the hand of Stradivari in any of Nicolo Amatis work although the unmistakable hands of Andrea Guarneri and Francesco Rugeri are evident

Count Ignazio Alessandro Cozio di Salabue and other early violin connoisseurs such as the Mantegazza brothers seemed to confuse the families of the Rugeri working in Cremona with the family of Giovanni Battista Rogeri working in Brecia These two separate families of violin makers both followed the Amati tradition of violin making however their work is distinctive from each other are not thought to be related The Rugeri family included the words il Per or detto il Per in their labels This nickname appears also in almost all of the religious and legal documents pertaining to the Rugeri family from 1669 onward and was probably meant to distinguish them from the many other Rugeri families in the region

Francesco lived and worked just outside of the walls of Cremona Italy in the Parishes of San Bernardo at No 7 Contrada Coltellai and also in the Parsish of San Sebastiano His most productive period was during the 1670s1680s during which time he closely followed the instruments of Nicol Amati sometimes even placing Amati labels in his instruments His success peaked after Nicol Amatis decline and before the rise of the workshop of Antonio Stradivari Francescos violins were characterized by a high level of craftsmanship and a very slightly higher arch After 1670 Francesco was ably assisted by 3 of his sons in his workshop The Rugeri tradition was carried on and developed by Francescos son Vincenzo Rugeri who was the only of his sons to later have an independent successful career as a luthier

Instruments created by Rugeri are highly desirable owing to their high level of craftsmanship and tone

Francesco was buried in the Church of San Trinita

Francesco Rugeri was the first to make an important contribution to cello making in the development of a smaller version of the cello that is now the standard His cello is smaller from the cellos made by other same period Cremonese luthiers Amati and Stradivari Cellos made by the others luthiers are quite massive and fairly unmanageable for modern players usage unless severely cut down in size

Francesco is the founder of Rugeri family also known as Ruggieri Family Three of his four sons follow his footsteps by involving in string instruments making

Other luthiers in the family are

Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom
The Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom Dutch Union for Progressive Judaism until 2006 Verbond voor LiberaalReligieuze Joden in Nederland Union for LiberalReligious Jews in the Netherlands is the umbrella organisation for Progressive Jews in the Netherlands and is affiliated to the World Union for Progressive Judaism It was founded in 1931

The Verbond claims a membership of some 3700 spread in ten different congregations throughout the country The biggest one is the congregation in Amsterdam with some 1700 members Other congregations exist in The Hague Rotterdam Utrecht Arnhem LJG Gelderland Tilburg LJG Brabant Enschede LJG Twente Heerenveen Zuidlaren LJG NoordNederland and Almere LJG Flevoland The NVPJs rabbis are Menno ten Brink David Lilienthal Awraham Soetendorp Edward van Voolen Marianne van Praag Tamara Benima and Albert Ringer It publishes its own magazine six times a year Levend Joods Geloof lit Living Jewish Faith

The Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom has separate organisations for women FLJVN and youngsters Netzer Holland there is also a separate Zionist organisation based on Progressive Jewish grounds ARZA It is also connected to four Jewish cemeteries one in Hoofddorp 1937 and one in Amstelveen 2002 The Liberal communities in The Hague and Rotterdam also have their own cemetery in the town of Rijswijk Beth Hachaim The cemetery was founded in 1990 after several requests from members from both communities The Congregation in Twente has its cemetery Gan haOlam in Enschede

Progressive Judaism was brought to the Netherlands in the 1930s by German immigrants many of them fleeing Nazi persecution The first Progressive rabbi in the Netherlands was Meir L Lasker followed by Germanborn Rabbi Norden The first congregation was founded in 1931 in The Hague in the same year followed by one in Amsterdam The congregations grew rapidly throughout the years mostly because of the arrival of thousands of German Jews of whom most were part of the Reform tradition On 18 October 1931 the Verbond van LiberaalGodsdienstige Joden lit Union for LiberalReligious Jews was founded Services were held regularly and the Union published its own paper Nieuw Joods Leven lit New Jewish Life

At the eve of World War II the Amsterdam community alone had some 900 members ten years earlier Progressive Judaism had virtually been nonexistent in the Netherlands  the religious landscape was limited to Ashkenazi Orthodox Judaism and a smaller community of Sephardi Jews

World War II saw the destruction of most of Jewish life in the Netherlands during the Holocaust more than 75 of Dutch Jews were killed by the Nazis But the community was vibrant and small initiatives were started in the years after the Second World War to revitalize Jewish life again although this was hard in a country where the Jewish community had diminished from more than 140000 in 1940 to a mere 25000 in the 1950s A new Liberal community was started in Amsterdam in 1946 the community had some 50 members only a fraction of the 900 six years earlier

It was not until the 1960s that Progressive Judaism started to grow once again in the Netherlands Much of its success was related to the hard work of Rabbi Jacob Soetendorp rabbi for the Liberal community in Amsterdam since 1954 Because of his hard work new communities started to spring up again within the Jewish Netherlands  sometimes much to the disagreement of the Orthodox Jewish community in the Netherlands combined in the Nederlands Isralitisch Kerkgenootschap which until this day does not fully recognize the Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom

The 1990s and the first years of the 21st century saw a new impulse to Progressive Judaism in the Netherlands with the establishment of three new communities one in Utrecht in 1993 one in Heerenveen Beth Hatsafon in 2000 and one in Almere Beth Bnei Jonah in 2003

The Levisson Instituut was founded in 2002 with the aim to provide rabbinical training for Dutch Jewish students affiliated with the NVPJ The institute is based on the premises of the University of Amsterdam and receives educational assistance from the Leo Baeck College in London amongst others 
Currently seven students are training at the Institute and are providing liturgical and pastoral support within the Liberal communities
Dean of Studies is Swedishborn Rabbi David Lilienthal

Richard Garrett amp Sons
Richard Garrett  Sons was a manufacturer of agricultural machinery steam engines and trolleybuses Their factory was Leiston Works in Leiston Suffolk England The company was founded by Richard Garrett in 1778

The company was active under its original ownership between 1778 and 1932

In the late 1840s after cultivating a successful agricultural machine and implement business the company began producing portable steam engines The company grew to a major business employing around 2500 people Richard Garrett III grandson of the companys founder visited The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London where he saw some new American manufacturing ideas Richard Garrett III introduced flow line production a very early assembly line  and constructed a new workshop for the purpose in 1852 This was known as The Long Shop on account of its length A machine would start at one end of the Long Shop and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added There was also an upper level where other parts were made they would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level When the machine reached the end of the shop it would be complete

In 1914 following a major fire at the works it was decided to build a new factory on land that had been owned as a demonstration farm next to the station From then on the sites were always known as the Old Works and the New Works

The company joined the Agricultural  General Engineers AGE combine in 1919 and the combine entered receivership in 1932

The company was purchased by Beyer Peacock in 1932 after the collapse of AGE The business continued as Richard Garrett Engineering Works until the works finally closed in 1981

Today part of the old works is preserved as the Long Shop Museum Some of the offices are used as flats but the rest of that site has been demolished and the land used for housing Some of the New Works is still used as industrial units while the offices have been converted to flats and more built on the site known as Colonial House

The majority of the steam engines produced by Garrett were portable engines combined with their fixed steam engines and semiportables they represented 89 of the works output

Garrett produced a wide range of traction engines and ploughing engines 49 of which were exported

The construction of steam rollers was generally apportioned to Aveling  Porter by the AGE combine limiting the production of these engines by Garrett 90 of the rollers produced by Garrett were exported Garrett rollers were produced under licence under the name AnsaldoGarrett by Gio Ansaldo  C of Italy

Richard Garrett and Sons are perhaps best known for their steam tractors the most popular design of which was the Number 4 compound tractor commonly referred to as the 4CD

The company produced steam wagons of both the undertype and overtype configurations Their first steam wagons were three relatively unsuccessful undertypes constructed between 1904 and 1908

The failed undertype wagons were followed by a relatively successful line of overtypes the first being constructed in 1909 These wagons were developed using the experience Garretts designers had gained producing the tractors The majority of these wagons were fitted with superheaters a feature used as a marketing point against the unsuperheated Foden wagons The overtype wagons were initially produced in a 5ton capacity with a 3ton design following in 1911 By the early 1920s the overtype wagon market was declining in the face of competition from undertype steam wagons and petrol wagons In 1926 a lastditch attempt was made to produce an updated design of 6ton capacity using components from the new undertype designs but only 8 were produced Overall 693 overtypes were produced to the firms designs

The final Aveling  Porter overtype wagons were assembled by Garrett under the arrangements made at the formation of AGE

By 1920 the success of the Sentinel undertypes was evident and Garretts decided to reenter the undertype wagon market Their first prototype was produced in 1921 driven by a twocylinder engine with piston valves actuated by Joy valve gear Unusually for the time the wagon was fitted with Timken roller bearings on the crankshaft countershaft and axles This design was built under licence as the AdamovGarrett by Adamov of Czechoslovakia from 1925 In 1926 a prototype rigid sixwheeled wagon was produced In 1927 a poppet valve engine replaced the earlier design this being used until the end of production in 1932 310 wagons were produced in this second phase of undertype construction

From 1916 Garrett produced a range of electric vehicles Their first foray into the market was with a 3 ton batterypowered vehicle intended for local deliveries They later produced trolleybuses beginning in 1925 and manufacturing over 100 such vehicles over the next five years and refuse collection vehicles Notable amongst these was the GTZ 54 of which were made for Glasgow Corporation

Garrett were a pioneer in the construction of dieselengined road vehicles and their two 1928built experimental Crude Oil Wagons known as COWS in the works are believed to be the first Britishbuilt wagons fitted with diesel engines from new These vehicles were constructed using the chassis and running gear from the undertype wagon designs one a fourwheeler and the other a sixwheeler both fitted with a McLaren Benz engine

The COWS proved the concept of a diesel wagon and in 1930 the company embarked on designing a production vehicle Due to the company being part of the AGE combine the engine chosen for the design was a Blackstones design the BHV6 The first vehicle designated the GB6 was completed in 1931 and a test programme was initiated The venture was not successful primarily due to the unreliability of the Blackstone engine and the perilous economic state of the works at that time After the company was bought by Beyer Peacock a halfhearted attempt was made to market the design with a Gardner engine fitted but no wagon was ever produced

As the film begins a boy with a large birthmark covering one eye runs frantically through a blizzard in Jotunheimen being pursued by an unknown entity Eventually he stumbles and his unseen pursuer catches up to him Despite his pleas the person proceeds to bury him alive in the snow

Years later a young group of friends consisting of Jannicke her boyfriend Eirik and their friends Mikal Ingunn and Morten Tobias are going on a snowboarding vacation in Jotunheimen They drive to a secluded area in the mountains to avoid the crowds When they arrive at the peak they immediately begin snowboarding down the mountain slopes Morten Tobias suddenly takes a bad fall and breaks his leg Jannicke takes charge and sets his leg but realizes they cant care for it properly out in the elements They also have no cell reception and the car is too far away to get there before dark Wandering over a hill they spot a lodge and decide to seek help there

When they get to the lodge Eirik discovers that the place is deserted He breaks in through a window and unlocks a door As Jannicke looks for medical supplies she comes across a box that contains superglue and a single shotgun shell Jannicke treats Mortens broken leg with alcohol and the superglue Eirik Mikal and Ingunn go explore the abandoned resort while Jannicke stays to keep Morten company The three discover the generator which Eirik fixes and power is restored to the resort Afterwards Mikal and Ingunn run off by themselves While exploring the various lodge suites they discover a room in disarray with a bed burnt to cinders Eirik on his way back to the parlor hears a clanking noise from down in the cellar and assumes its Mikal and Ingunn He calls for them to be more careful but he receives no reply With the lights back on music playing and plentiful amounts of food and alcohol the group relaxes in the parlor Jannicke finds the hotels guestbook and discovers that the last guest checked in some time in 1975 and there is a message reading We hope you find your son Inside the book there is a picture of a family that includes the boy with a birthmark over his eye 

The group settles in for the night with Mikal and Ingunn running off to a suite Jannicke and Eirik cuddling under blankets in the parlor and Morten Tobias alone on the couch Making out in bed Mikal begins to get aggressive and Ingunn shoves him off He then leaves in a huff Ingunn hears a strange noise and thinking its Mikal returning enters the hall Shes suddenly attacked by an unknown shape and runs through the halls screaming for help but is drowned out by the music playing in the parlor Before she can reach Mikal whos sitting at the bar shes stabbed by a pickaxe and dragged away 

The next morning Eirik leaves to go for help and Mikal heads to the suite to apologize to Ingunn Eirik stumbles across Ingunns body in the snow Hes then smashed in the head by the blunt end of a pickaxe Mikal gets no answer from Ingunn so he and Jannicke explore the basement They find items that were invented long after the lodge closed in the 1970s and become nervous Jannicke goes to talk to Ingunn and enters the suite to discover its covered in blood She brings Mikal and Morten Tobias to the suite just as a blast of wind flows through the hallway from an open door They realize someone else is in the lodge and barricade themselves in an empty suite Footsteps are heard in the hall and someone begins to slam against the door trying to get in When they eventually leave Mikal tells Jannicke they should run She points out that Morten Tobias cant and Mikal says they should just leave him Jannicke refuses and Mikal escapes through a window Jannicke and Morten Tobias watch through the window as Mikal hides in a shed Suddenly a massive Mountain Man appears outside wearing animals skins and goggles He enters the shed and Mikal tries to run but becomes stuck in a bear trap The Mountain Man breaks Mikals neck

Jannicke drags Morten Tobias to a pantry and tells him to memorize the label on a can until she gets back She narrowly misses being spotted by the Mountain Man as he drags Mikals body inside Jannicke runs to the shed where she finds some skis a sled and a shotgun She runs into the parlor where she picks up the discarded shotgun shell and loads the gun She goes back to the pantry and tells Morten Tobias that she has a plan

They go down to the basement where Jannicke kills the generator alerting the Mountain Man to their whereabouts Morten Tobias finds a box cutter and puts it in his pocket Jannicke waits for the Mountain Man to appear so she can shoot him but discovers the keys she gave to Eirik on the floor When she enters the back room she finds Eirik tied up but alive Unable to free him she goes back to wait for the Mountain Man When he appears he goes straight into the back room Jannicke points the gun at him but he shuts off his flashlight and disappears into darkness Thinking quickly Jannicke shuts the door and locks him in the back room but refuses to leave him in there with Eirik Opening the door she shoots but is knocked askew by Morton Tobias who realizes the Mountain Man is using Eirik as a human shield The Mountain Man impales Eirik with his pickaxe killing him Morten Tobias tells Jannicke to run He tries to stop the Mountain Man with a saw but to no avail and The Mountain Man kills him Jannicke grabs her skis and runs outside into the darkness only to be knocked out by the Mountain Man 

When she awakes shes on the sled buried under her dead friends The Mountain Man brings them to a deep ravine and begins tossing the bodies over one by one Jannicke grabs the box cutter out of Morten Tobiass pocket and lies still Jannicke is the last to be dragged off the sled and as the Mountain Man grabs her she stabs him in the neck with the box cutter They struggle over the pickaxe and end up on the ground by the edge of the ravine As the Mountain Man is about to stab Jannicke she rips off his goggles revealing a birthmark over his eye Taken by surprise the Mountain Man lets his guard down Jannicke grabs his pickaxe and stabs him in the stomach sending him over the ravine

In a flashback we see the Mountain Man as a boy running from his pursuer As hes covered in the snow he looks up to see the faces of his parents burying him alive

The Mountain Man hits the bottom of the ravine surrounded by the bodies of Jannickes friends Jannicke exhausted collapses into the snow

Architectural model
An architectural model is a type of scale model  a physical representation of a structure  built to study aspects of an architectural design or to communicate design ideas

Depending on the purpose models can be made from a variety of materials including blocks paper and wood and at a variety of scales

Architectural models are used by architects for a range of purposes

Types of models include
Buildings are increasingly designed in software with CAD computeraided design systems Early virtual modelling involved the fixing of arbitrary lines and points in virtual space mainly to produce technical drawings Modern packages include advanced features such as databases of components automated engineering calculations visual flythroughs dynamic reflections and accurate textures and colours

As an extension to CAD computeraided design and BIM building information modelling virtual reality architectural sessions are also being adopted at increasingly faster rates As this technology enables participants to be immersed in a 11 scale model essentially experiencing the building before it is even being built

Rough study models can be made quickly using cardboard wooden blocks polystyrene foam foam boards and other materials Such models are an efficient design tool for threedimensional understanding of a structure space or form used by architects interior designers and exhibit designers

Common materials used for centuries in architectural model building were card stock balsa wood basswood and other woods Modern professional architectural model builders are taking advantage of twentyfirst century materials such as Taskboard a flexible and lightweight woodfiber board plastics wooden and woodenplastic composites foams foam board and urethane compounds
A number of companies produce readymade pieces for structural components eg girders beams siding furniture figures people vehicles trees bushes and other features which are found in the models Features such as vehicles people figurines trees street lights and other are called scenery elements and serve not only to beautify the model but also to help the observer to obtain a correct feel of scale and proportions represented by the model

Increasingly rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and CNC routing are used to automatically construct models straight from CAD plans

Architectural models are being constructed at much smaller scale than their 11 counterpart

The scales and their architectural use is broadly as follows

Sometimes model railroad scales such as and are used due to ready availability of commercial figures vehicles and trees in those scales and models of large buildings are most often built in approximately that range of scales due to size considerations

The Alien unproduced film
The Alien was an unproduced IndianAmerican science fiction film in development in the late 1960s which was eventually cancelled It was to be directed by celebrated Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray and coproduced by Columbia Pictures The script was written by Ray in 1967 loosely based on Bankubabur Bandhu Banku Babus Friend or Mr Bankus Friend a Bengali science fiction story he had written in 1962 for Sandesh the Ray family magazine which gained popularity among Bengalis in the early 1960s Bankubabur Bandhu was eventually adapted into a television film by Satyajit Rays son Sandip Ray and a play by the theatre group Swapnasandhani Kaushik Sen in 2006

The plot revolves around a spaceship that lands in a pond in rural Bengal The villagers begin worshiping it as a temple risen from the depths of the earth The alien known as Mr Ang establishes contact with a young village boy named Haba meaning Dumb in Bengali through dreams and also plays a number of pranks on the village community in the course of its short stay on planet Earth The plot contains the ebullient presence of an Indian businessman a journalist from Calcutta and an American engineer

Rays biographer W Andrew Robinson describes one particular scene from the screenplay as follows In a series of fantastically quick short steps over the lotus leaves the Alien reaches the shore of the pond He looks down at the grass examines the blade and is off hopping into the bamboo grove There the Alien sees a small plant His eyes light up with a yellow light He passes his hand over the plant and flowers come out A thin soft highpitched laugh shows the Alien is pleased

The Alien had Columbia Pictures as producer for this planned USIndia coproduction and Peter Sellers and Marlon Brando acting in lead roles However Ray was surprised to find that the script he had written had already been copyrighted and the fee appropriated by Michael Wilson Rays representative in Hollywood Wilson had copyrighted the script as cowriter despite not being involved in any way in its creation Marlon Brando later dropped out of the project and though an attempt was made to bring James Coburn in his place Ray became disillusioned and returned to Calcutta Columbia expressed interest in reviving the project several times in the 1970s and 1980s but nothing came of it

When the New Hollywood film ET the ExtraTerrestrial was produced in 1982 Ray noted similarities in the movie to his own earlier script Ray discussed the collapse of the project in a 1980 Sight  Sound feature with further details revealed by his biographer Andrew Robinson in The Inner Eye 1989 Ray claimed that Steven Spielbergs film would not have been possible without my script of The Alien being available throughout America in mimeographed copies When the issue was raised by the press Spielberg denied this claim and said I was a kid in high school when his script was circulating in Hollywood Star Weekend Magazine disputes Spielbergs claim pointing out that he had graduated from high school in 1965 and began his career as a director in Hollywood in 1969 The Times of India noted that ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 had remarkable parallels with The Alien These parallels include the physical nature of the alien In his screenplay which Ray wrote entirely in English he described the alien as a cross between a gnome and a famished refugee child large head spindly limbs a lean torso Is it male or female or neuter We dont know What its form basically conveys is a kind of ethereal innocence and it is difficult to associate either great evil or great power with it yet a feeling of eeriness is there because of the resemblance to a sickly human child

The 2003 Bollywood film Koi Mil Gaya directed by Rakesh Roshan appears to be based on Satyajit Rays The Alien In particular the film appears to parallel The Alien more closely than ET in that it revolves around an intellectually challenged person coming in contact with a friendly alien

In 2003 Satyajit Rays son Sandip Ray began working on adapting Rays original 1962 story Bankubabur Bandhu into a Bengali television movie of the same name The adapted film directed by Kaushik Sen was eventually shown on television in India in 2006 This version is based on Rays original story Bankubabur Bandhu where the protagonist was a school teacher named Banku Babu in contrast to his script for The Alien where the protagonist was a boy named Haba

Zuleikha tradition
Zuleikha  is the name given to the Biblical Potiphars wife in Jewish and Muslim tradition although she is only mentioned as the wife of Aziz in the Quran The word Azeez is the Qurans honorific title designated for Potiphar

The Bible Genesis 39520 reports about her treatment of Joseph slave to her husband Potiphar

A story about Zuleikha is told in Sefer haYashar where she was mocked by other aristocratic Egyptian ladies her circle of friends for being infatuated with a Hebrew slave boy Inviting her friends to her home Zuleikha gave them all oranges and knives to slice them with While they engaged in this task Zuleikha had Joseph walk through the room Distracted by his handsomeness all the ladies accidentally cut themselves with the knives drawing blood Zuleikha then reminded her friends that she had to see Joseph every day Following this incident her contemporaries no longer mocked her

Christian and other scriptural commentators have regarded Zuleikha as a sinner and villainess Notable exceptions are the great Sufi mystic poets Rumi and Hafiz For Rumi Zuleikhas obsession with Joseph is a symptom and manifestation of the souls great deep longing for God This he insists is true of any persons deep love for another Jewish commentators also see some good motives in her actions Rashi comments that the wife of Potiphar saw through astrology that she would have children through Joseph The astrological calculations however were slightly off Asenath her daughter by adoption in some accounts became the wife of Joseph and therefore the wife of Potiphar begot grandchildren not children through Joseph

Agricultural amp General Engineers
Agricultural  General Engineers Limited AGE was a holding company formed on 4 June 1919 during a postwar economic boom to combine five British engineering companies Aveling  Porter E H Bentall Blackstone Richard Garrett and J  F Howard The holding companys business was described to the judge considering its 1932 winding up as agricultural transport road constructional and general engineers

It paid no dividend on any class of its shares and after a catastrophic trading loss in 1931 and allegations of fraud was liquidated following Barclays Banks successful application for the winding up order made by the court in April 1932 Many of its subsidiaries were revived as independent businesses

Thomas Lake Aveling and Frank Garrett wanted to bring together a number of agricultural machinery businesses into one strong combine where they would be rationalised and their efficiency improved They planned to end competition between members in their home market and create a business large enough to compete with the North American firms in export markets 

However the centralisation of purchasing which was soon dispensed with sales and finance in expensive London headquarters created a heavy financial burden not justified by its benefits As it turned out lack of competition in the home market seemed to inhibit innovation and responses to market conditions Subsidiaries moved rather late from steam to internal combustion engines The substantial profits of some combine members shored up weaker members and supported the expensive headquarters and that left no income for the shareholders

Shares were offered to the general public in November 1919 for the funds needed to carry out this large holding company plan and the issue was completed and listed on the London Stock Exchange a week later The principal subscriptions may have come from the previous owners of the new subsidiaries 

Constituent companies were assigned sectors of the market to reduce competition within the group The group headquarters were located in AGEs own impressive Aldwych House in Aldwych London but most of the member companies were in rural areas Negotiations for the site in Aldwych were completed in early January 1920 AGE were in occupation in early 1924 and the building was finally completed in 1926

Following difficult trading conditions the companys capital was heavily written down in 1924 from 8 million to 67 million
In October 1928 the chairman was able to report there were close on 10000 workpeople in AGEs employ and the various works covered a total of 350 acres The sharp slumps and difficult strikes of the 1920s had not been foreseen and with ample capital large extensions were made to the works and plants of the constituent businesses By 1924 plant and buildings were utilised to less than onethird of their capacity Speaking to shareholders in October 1928 the chairman hoped they would become fully employed in the 1930s He also noted another major problem  changes to taxation laws meant losses by subsidiaries could not be offset against profits from sister companies

In late 1930 the chairman proposed to offer shareholders an opportunity to invest further capital There is no further mention of this proposal The 70 per cent holding in Peter Brotherhood was realised in early 1931 

In December 1931 many of the main board directors circulated a letter to shareholders pointing out that the profits of the groups three most successful businesses Blackstone Barford  Perkins and Aveling  Porter had never reached shareholders being swallowed up by the heavy expenses of the holding company and the unsuccessful businesses in the group The holding company paid no dividend on any class of shares for eleven years These directors asked for an investigation before the full boards now apparently inevitable reconstruction proposals and a formal request for new capital
There was a countersuggestion to make the holding company a trading business by buying the businesses of all the subsidiaries but the directors remained divided and in the face of an enormous trading loss for 1931 a court order requested by AGEs bankers for the compulsory winding up of Agricultural  General Engineers Limited was issued 25 April 1932

The financially healthy component businesses were bought from the receiver and reestablished often by groups of previous owners

AGE shareholders lost all their investment after waiting more than twelve fruitless years for a report of good profits and their first dividend

Carmen de Prodicione Guenonis
Carmen de Prodicione Guenonis Song of the Treachery of Ganelon is an anonymous poem in medieval Latin written in the first half of the 12th century Composed in elegiac couplets by an unskilled versifier it is a version of the legendary history of the Battle of Roncevaux Pass This is the same story that is told in the Old French Chanson de Roland and in several other versions and languages The Latin poem seems to be based on a hearing or reading of an Old French chanson de geste in the same tradition as the written Chanson but differing from it in many details perhaps around the year 1120

Bayard Clarke
Bayard Clarke March 17 1815  June 20 1884 was a United States Representative from New York

Born in New York City on March 17 1815 Clarke was a member of one of the citys oldest and most prominent families He graduated from Geneva College in 1835 studied law and was admitted to the bar

From 1836 to 1840 he was attach to Lewis Cass United States Minister to France While in France he was a student in the Royal Cavalry School

Upon returning to the United States Clarke joined the United States Army receiving a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the 8th Infantry in March 1841 He transferred to the 2nd Dragoons in September 1841 During his service Clarke took part in the Seminole Wars in Florida

Clarke resigned from the Army in December 1843 and practiced law in New York City and Westchester County Also in December 1843 he married Alletta Remsen Lawrence a member of another prominent New York family

He was an unsuccessful Whig candidate for election in 1852 to the Thirtythird Congress In 1854 he was elected as an Opposition Party candidate to the Thirtyfourth Congress holding office from March 4 1855 to March 3 1857 He declined renomination as a Republican in 1856 and resumed practicing law

At the start of the American Civil War Clarke went to Washington DC to offer his services He was commissioned as a Colonel and was an organizer of the 1st New York Cavalry Regiment Lincoln Cavalry which was commanded by Carl Schurz Clarke and then Andrew T McReynolds

In mid1861 there were news accounts indicating that Clarke would be commissioned a Brigadier General and assigned to command a school for cavalry in Westchester County This plan does not seem to have been carried out since there are no further references to Clarkes promotion or the operation of a cavalry school in Westchester County

In retirement Clarke lived in England for several years He later resided in Florida during the winter and an island on Schroon Lake New York during the summer He died on June 20 1884 at his summer home Isola Bella in Schroon Lake He was interred in a vault at First Presbyterian Church Cemetery Newtown New York

His name sometimes appears as Clark in contemporary news accounts and other records

<doc id="7743069" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7743069" title="Missouri Compromise">
Missouri Compromise
The Missouri Compromise was the legislation that provided for the admission of Maine to the United States as a free state along with Missouri as a slave state thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South in the United States Senate As part of the compromise slavery was prohibited north of the 3630 parallel excluding Missouri The 16th United States Congress passed the legislation on March 3 1820 and President James Monroe signed it on March 6 1820
Earlier on February 4 1820 Representative James Tallmadge Jr a Jeffersonian Republican from New York submitted two amendments to Missouris request for statehood which included restrictions on slavery Southerners objected to any bill which imposed federal restrictions on slavery believing that slavery was a state issue settled by the Constitution However with the Senate evenly split at the opening of the debates both sections possessing 11 states the admission of Missouri as a slave state would give the South an advantage Northern critics including Federalists and DemocraticRepublicans objected to the expansion of slavery into the Louisiana Purchase territory on the Constitutional inequalities of the threefifths rule which conferred Southern representation in the federal government derived from a states slave population Jeffersonian Republicans in the North ardently maintained that a strict interpretation of the Constitution required that Congress act to limit the spread of slavery on egalitarian grounds Northern Republicans rooted their antislavery arguments not on expediency but in egalitarian morality and The Constitution said northern Jeffersonians strictly interpreted gave the sons of the founding generation the legal tools to hasten the removal of slavery including the refusal to admit additional slave states

When freesoil Maine offered its petition for statehood the Senate quickly linked the Maine and Missouri bills making Maine admission a condition for Missouri entering the Union with slavery unrestricted Senator Jesse B Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso excluding slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36 30 parallel The combined measures passed the Senate only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky in a desperate bid to break the deadlock divided the Senate bills Clay and his procompromise allies succeeded in pressuring half the antirestrictionist House Southerners to submit to the passage of the Thomas proviso while maneuvering a number of restrictionist House northerners to acquiesce in supporting Missouri as a slave state The Missouri question in the 15th Congress ended in stalemate on March 4 1819 the House sustaining its northern antislavery position and the Senate blocking a slavery restricted statehood

The Missouri Compromise was controversial at the time as many worried that the country had become lawfully divided along sectional lines The bill was effectively repealed in the KansasNebraska Act of 1854 and declared unconstitutional in Dred Scott v Sandford 1857 This increased tensions over slavery and eventually led to the Civil War

The Era of Good Feelings closely associated with the administration of President James Monroe 18171825 was characterized by the dissolution of national political identities With the discredited Federalists in decline nationally the amalgamated or hybridized Republicans adopted key Federalist economic programs and institutions further erasing party identities and consolidating their victory
The economic nationalism of the Era of Good Feelings that would authorize the Tariff of 1816 and incorporate the Second Bank of the United States portended an abandonment of the Jeffersonian political formula for strict construction of the constitution a limited central government and commitments to the primacy of Southern agrarian interests The end of opposition parties also meant the end of party discipline and the means to suppress internecine factional animosities Rather than produce political harmony as President James Monroe had hoped amalgamation had led to intense rivalries among Jeffersonian Republicans
It was amid the good feelings of this period  during which Republican Party discipline was in abeyance  that the Tallmadge Amendment surfaced

The immense Louisiana Purchase territories had been acquired through federal executive action followed by Republican legislative authorization in 1803 during the Thomas Jefferson administration

Prior to its purchase in 1803 the governments of Spain and France had sanctioned slavery in the region In 1812 the state of Louisiana a major cotton producer and the first to be carved from the Louisiana Purchase had entered the Union as a slave state Predictably Missourians were adamant that slave labor should not be molested by the federal government In the years following the War of 1812 the region now known as Missouri Territory experienced rapid settlement led by slaveholding planters

Agriculturally the land comprising the lower reaches of the Missouri River from which that new state would be formed had no prospects as a major cotton producer Suited for diversified farming the only crop regarded as promising for slave labor was hemp culture On that basis southern planters immigrated with their chattel to Missouri the slave population rising from 3100 in 1810 to 10000 in 1820 In a total population 67000 slaves represented about 15 percent

By 1818 the population of Missouri territory was approaching the threshold that would qualify it for statehood An enabling act was provided to Congress empowering territorial residents to select convention delegates and draft a state constitution The admission of Missouri territory as a slave state was expected to be more or less routine

When the Missouri statehood bill was opened for debate in the House of Representative on February 13 1819 early exchanges on the floor proceeded without serious incident In the course of these proceedings however Representative James Tallmadge Jr of New York tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings with the following amendments

A political outsider the 41year old Tallmadge conceived his amendment based on a personal aversion to slavery He had played a leading role in accelerating emancipation of the remaining slaves in New York in 1817 Moreover he had campaigned against Illinois Black Codes though ostensibly freesoil the new Illinois state constitution permitted indentured servitude and a limited form of slavery As a New York Republican Tallmadge maintained an uneasy association with Governor DeWitt Clinton a former Republican who depended on support from exFederalists Clintons faction was hostile to Tallmadge for his spirited defense of General Andrew Jackson over his contentious invasion of Florida
Tallmadge had to back from a fellow New York Republican Congressman John W Taylor not to be confused with legislator John Taylor of Caroline County Virginia Taylor also had antislavery credentials In February 1819 he had proposed similar slave restrictions on Arkansas territory in the House but failed 8987 He would lead the proTallmadge antislavery forces during the 16th Congress in 1820

The amendment instantly exposed the polarization among Jeffersonian Republicans over the future of slavery in the nation
Northern Jeffersonian Republicans formed a coalition across factional lines with remnants of the Federalists Southern Jeffersonian united in almost unanimous opposition The ensuing debates pitted the northern restrictionists antislavery legislators who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories and southern antirestrictionists proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting slavery expansion
The sectional rupture over slavery among Jeffersonian Republicans first exposed in the Missouri crisis had its roots in the Revolutionary generation

Five Congressmen in Maine were opposed to spreading slavery into new territories Dr Brian Purnell professor of Africana Studies and US history at Bowdoin College writes in Portland Magazine Martin Kinsley Joshua Cushman Ezekiel Whitman Enoch Lincoln and James Parkerwanted to prohibit slaverys spread into new territories In 1820 they voted against the Missouri Compromise and against Maines independence In their defense they wrote that if the North and the nation embarked upon this Compromiseand ignored what experiences proved namely that southern slave holders were determined to dominate the nation through ironclad unity and perpetual pressure to demand more land and more slavesthen these five Mainers declared Americans shall deserve to be considered a besotted and stupid race fit only to be led blindfold and worthy only to be treated with sovereign contempt

The Missouri crisis marked a rupture in the Republican Ascendency  the national association of Jeffersonian Republicans that dominated national politics in the postWar of 1812 period

The Founders had inserted both principled and expedient elements in the establishing documents The Declaration of Independence of 1776 was grounded on the claim that liberty established a moral ideal that made universal equality a common right The Revolutionary War generation had formed a government of limited powers in 1787 to embody the principles in the Declaration but burdened with the one legacy that defied the principles of 1776 human bondage In a pragmatic commitment to form the Union the federal apparatus would forego any authority to directly interfere with the institution of slavery where it existed under local control within the states This acknowledgment of state sovereignty provided for the participation of those states most committed to slave labor With this understanding slaveholders had cooperated in authorizing the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 and to outlawing the transAtlantic slave trade in 1808 Though the Founders sanctioned slavery they did so with the implicit understanding that the slaveholding states would take steps to relinquish the institution as opportunities arose
Southern states after the War for Independence had regarded slavery as an institution in decline with the exception of Georgia and South Carolina This was manifest in the shift towards diversified farming in the Upper South and in the gradual emancipation of slaves in New England and more significantly in the midAtlantic states Beginning in the 1790s with the introduction of the cotton gin and by 1815 with the vast increase in demand for cotton internationally slavebased agriculture underwent an immense revival spreading the institution westward to the Mississippi River Slavery opponents in the South vacillated as did their hopes for the imminent demise of human bondage
However rancorous the disputes among Southerners themselves over the virtues of a slavebased society they united as a section when confronted by external challenges to their institution The free states were not to meddle in the affairs of the slaveholders Southern leaders  of whom virtually all identified as Jeffersonian Republicans  denied that Northerners had any business encroaching on matters related to slavery Northern attacks on the institution were condemned as incitements to riot among the slave populations  deemed a dire threat to white southern security

Northern Jeffersonian Republicans embraced the Jeffersonian antislavery legacy during the Missouri debates explicitly citing the Declaration of Independence as an argument against expanding the institution Southern leaders seeking to defend slavery would renounce the documents universal egalitarian applications and its declaration that all men are created equal

Article One Section Two of the US Constitution supplemented legislative representation in those states where residents owned slaves Known as the threefifths clause or the federal ratio threefifths 60 of the slave population was numerically added to the free population This sum was used to calculate Congressional districts per state and the number of delegates to the Electoral College The federal ratio produced a significant number of legislative victories for the South in the years preceding the Missouri crisis as well as augmenting its influence in party caucuses the appointment of judges and the distribution of patronage It is unlikely that the threefifths clause prior to 1820 was decisive in affecting legislation on slavery Indeed with the rising northern representation in the House the Souths share of the membership had declined since the 1790s

Hostility to the federal ratio had historically been the object of the now nationally ineffectual Federalists they blamed their collective decline on the Virginia Dynasty expressed in partisan terms rather than in moral condemnation of slavery The proDe Witt ClintonFederalist faction carried on the tradition posing as antirestrictionists for the purpose of advancing their fortunes in New York politics

Senator Rufus King of New York a Clinton associate was the last Federalist icon still active on the national stage a fact irksome to Southern Republicans A signatory to the US Constitution he had strongly opposed the threefifths rule in 1787 In the 1819 15th Congress debates he revived his critique as a complaint that New England and the MidAtlantic States suffered unduly from the federal ratio declaring himself degraded politically inferior to the slaveholders Federalists North and South preferred to mute antislavery rhetoric but during the 1820 debates in the 16th Congress King and other old Federalists would expand their critique to include moral considerations of slavery

Republican James Tallmadge Jr and the Missouri restrictionists deplored the threefifths clause because it had translated into political supremacy for the South They had no agenda to remove it from the founding document only to prevent its further application west of the Mississippi River

As determined as Southern Republicans were to secure Missouri statehood with slavery the threefifths clause failed to provide the margin of victory in the 15th Congress Blocked by Northern Republicans  largely on egalitarian grounds  with sectional support from Federalists the bill would die in the upper house where the federal ratio had no relevance The balance of power between the sections and the maintenance of Southern preeminence on matters related to slavery resided in the Senate

Northern voting majorities in the lower house did not translate into political dominance The fulcrum for proslavery forces resided in the upper house of Congress There constitutional compromise in 1787 had provided for exactly two senators per state regardless of its population the South with its small white demographic relative to the North benefited from this arrangement Since 1815 sectional parity in the Senate had been achieved through paired admissions leaving the North and South at the time of Missouri territory application for statehood at eleven states each

The South voting as a bloc on measures that challenged slaveholding interests and augmented by defections from Free State Senators with Southern sympathies was able to tally majorities The Senate stood as the bulwark and source of the Slave Power  a power that required admission of slave states to the Union to preserve its national primacy

Missouri statehood with the Tallmadge amendment approved would set a trajectory towards a Free State transMississippi and a decline in Southern political authority The question as to whether the Congress could lawfully restrain the growth of slavery in Missouri took on great importance among the slave states The moral dimensions of the expansion of human bondage would be raised by Northern Republicans on constitutional grounds

The Tallmadge amendment was the first serious challenge to the extension of slavery and raised questions concerning the interpretation of the republics founding documents

Jeffersonian Republicans justified Tallmadges slavery restrictions on the grounds that Congress possessed the authority to impose territorial statutes which would remain in force after statehood was established Representative John W Taylor pointed to Indiana and Illinois where their Free State status conformed to the antislavery provisions in the Northwest Ordinance

Further antislavery legislators invoked Article Four Section Four of the Constitution which required that states provide a republican form of government As the Louisiana Territory was not part of the United States in 1787 they argued introducing slavery into Missouri would thwart the egalitarian intent of the Founders

Proslavery Republicans countered that the Constitution had long been interpreted as having relinquished any claim to restricting slavery within the states The free inhabitants of Missouri either in the territorial phase or during statehood had the right to establish slavery  or disestablish it  exclusive of central government interference As to the Northwest Ordinance Southerners denied that this could serve as a lawful antecedent for the territories of the Louisiana Purchase as the ordinance had been issued originally under the Articles of Confederation not under the US Constitution

As a legal precedent they offered the treaty acquiring the Louisiana lands in 1803 the document included a provision Article 3 that extended the rights of US citizens to all inhabitants of the new territory including the protection of property in slaves When slaveholders embraced Jeffersonian constitutional strictures on a limited central government they were reminded that Jefferson as US President in 1803 had deviated from these precepts when he wielded federal executive power to double the size the United States including the lands under consideration for Missouri statehood In doing so he set a Constitutional precedent that would serve to rationalize Tallmadges federally imposed slavery restrictions

The 15th Congress debates focusing as it did on constitutional questions largely avoided the moral dimensions raised by the topic of slavery That the unmentionable subject had been raised publicly was deeply offensive to Southern Congressmen and violated the longheld sectional understanding between free and slave state legislators

Missouri statehood confronted Southern Jeffersonians with the prospect of applying the egalitarian principles espoused by the Revolutionary generation This would require halting the spread of slavery westward and confine the institution to where it already existed Faced with a population of 15 million slaves and the lucrative production of cotton the South would abandon hopes for containment Slaveholders in the 16th Congress in an effort to come to grips with this paradox would resort to a theory that called for extending slavery geographically so as to encourage its decline diffusion

On February 16 1819 the House Committee of the Whole voted to link Tallmadges provisions with the Missouri enabling legislation approving the move 7967 Following the committee vote debates resumed over the merits of each of Tallmadges provisions in the enabling act The debates in the Houses 2nd session in 1819 lasted only three days They have been characterized as rancorous fiery bitter blistering furious and bloodthirsty

Northern representatives outnumbered the South in House membership 105 to 81 When each of the restrictionist provisions were put to the vote they passed along sectional lines 87 to 76 in favor of prohibition on further slave migration into Missouri Table 1 and 82 to 78 in favor of emancipating slave offspring at age twentyfive
The enabling bill was passed to the Senate where both parts of it were rejected 22 to 16 opposed to restricting new slaves in Missouri supported by five northerners two of whom were the proslavery legislators from the free state of Illinois and 31 to 7 against gradual emancipation for slave children born poststatehood House antislavery restrictionists refused to concur with the Senate proslavery antirestrictionists Missouri statehood would devolve upon the 16th Congress in December 1819

The Missouri Compromise debates stirred suspicions among proslavery interests that the underlying purpose of the Tallmadge amendments had little to do with opposition to slavery expansion
The accusation was first leveled in the House by the Republican antirestrictionist John Holmes from the District of Maine He suggested that Senator Rufus Kings warm support for the Tallmadge amendment concealed a conspiracy to organize a new antislavery party in the North  a party composed of old Federalists in combination with disaffected antislavery Republicans The fact that King in the Senate and Tallmadge and Tyler in the House  all New Yorkers  were among the vanguard for slavery restriction in Missouri lent credibility to these charges When King was reelected to the US Senate in January 1820 during the 16th Congress debates and with bipartisan support suspicions deepened and would persist throughout the crisis Southern Jeffersonian Republican leadership including President Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson considered it as an article of faith that Federalists given the chance would destabilize the Union so as to reimpose monarchal rule in North America and consolidate political control over the people by expanding the functions of the central government Jefferson at first unperturbed by the Missouri question soon became convinced that a northern conspiracy was afoot with Federalists and cryptoFederalists posing as Republicans using Missouri statehood as a pretext

Due to the disarray of the Republican Ascendency brought about by amalgamation fears abounded among Southerners that a Free State party might take shape in the event that Congress failed to reach an understanding over Missouri and slavery Such a party would threaten Southern preeminence Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts surmised that the political configuration for just such a sectional party already existed
That the Federalists were anxious to regain a measure of political participation in national politics is indisputable There was no basis however for the charge that Federalists had directed Tallmadge in his antislavery measures nor was there anything to indicate that a New Yorkbased KingClinton alliance sought to erect an antislavery party on the ruins of the Republican Party The allegations by Southern proslavery interests of a plot or that of consolidation as a threat to the Union misapprehended the forces at work in the Missouri crisis the core of the opposition to slavery in the Louisiana Purchase were informed by Jeffersonian egalitarian principles not a Federalist resurgence

To balance the number of slave states and free states the northern region of what was then Massachusetts the District of Maine ultimately gained admission into the United States as a free state to become Maine This only occurred as a result of a compromise involving slavery in Missouri and in the federal territories of the American West
The admission of another slave state would increase the Souths power at a time when northern politicians had already begun to regret the Constitutions ThreeFifths Compromise Although more than 60 percent of whites in the United States lived in the North by 1818 northern representatives held only a slim majority of congressional seats The additional political representation allotted to the South as a result of the ThreeFifths Compromise gave southerners more seats in the House of Representatives than they would have had if the number was based on just free population Moreover since each state had two Senate seats Missouris admission as a slave state would result in more southern than northern senators A bill to enable the people of the Missouri Territory to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary to admission into the Union came before the House of Representatives in Committee of the Whole on February 13 1819 James Tallmadge of New York offered an amendment named the Tallmadge Amendment that forbade further introduction of slaves into Missouri and mandated that all children of slave parents born in the state after its admission should be free at the age of 25 The committee adopted the measure and incorporated it into the bill as finally passed on February 17 1819 by the house The United States Senate refused to concur with the amendment and the whole measure was lost

During the following session 18191820 the House passed a similar bill with an amendment introduced on January 26 1820 by John W Taylor of New York allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama a slave state making the number of slave and free states equal In addition there was a bill in passage through the House January 3 1820 to admit Maine as a free state

The Senate decided to connect the two measures It passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution Before the bill was returned to the House a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B Thomas of Illinois excluding slavery from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 3630 north the southern boundary of Missouri except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri

The vote in the Senate was 24 for the compromise to 20 against The amendment and the bill passed in the Senate on February 17 and February 18 1820 The House then approved the Senate compromise amendment on a vote of 90 to 87 with those 87 votes coming from free state representatives opposed to slavery in the new state of Missouri The House then approved the whole bill 134 to 42 with opposition from the southern states

The two houses were at odds not only on the issue of the legality of slavery but also on the parliamentary question of the inclusion of Maine and Missouri within the same bill The committee recommended the enactment of two laws one for the admission of Maine the other an enabling act for Missouri They recommended against having restrictions on slavery but for including the Thomas amendment Both houses agreed and the measures were passed on March 5 1820 and were signed by President James Monroe on March 6

The question of the final admission of Missouri came up during the session of 18201821 The struggle was revived over a clause in Missouris new constitution written in 1820 requiring the exclusion of free negroes and mulattoes from the state Through the influence of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay The Great Compromiser an act of admission was finally passed upon the condition that the exclusionary clause of the Missouri constitution should never be construed to authorize the passage of any law impairing the privileges and immunities of any US citizen This deliberately ambiguous provision is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise

During the decades following 1820 Americans hailed the 1820 agreement as an essential compromise almost on the sacred level of the Constitution itself Although the Civil War broke out in 1861 historians often say the Compromise helped postpone the war

These disputes involved the competition between the southern and northern states for power in Congress and for control over future territories There were also the same factions emerging as the DemocraticRepublican party began to lose its coherence In an April 22 letter to John Holmes Thomas Jefferson wrote that the division of the country created by the Compromise Line would eventually lead to the destruction of the Union

The debate over admission of Missouri also raised the issue of sectional balance for the country was equally divided between slave and free states with eleven each To admit Missouri as a slave state would tip the balance in the Senate made up of two senators per state in favor of the slave states For this reason northern states wanted Maine admitted as a free state Maine was admitted in 1820 and Missouri in 1821 but no further states were added until 1836 when Arkansas was admitted

From the constitutional standpoint the Compromise of 1820 was important as the example of Congressional exclusion of slavery from US territory acquired since the Northwest Ordinance Nevertheless the Compromise was deeply disappointing to AfricanAmericans in both the North and South as it stopped the southern progression of gradual emancipation at Missouris southern border and legitimized slavery as a southern institution

The provisions of the Missouri Compromise forbidding slavery in the former Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 3630 north were effectively repealed by Stephen A Douglass KansasNebraska Act of 1854 The repeal of the Compromise caused outrage in the North and sparked the return to politics of Abraham Lincoln who criticized slavery and excoriated Douglass act in his Peoria Speech October 16 1854

Port Logan
Port Logan formerly Port Nessock is a small village in the parish of Kirkmaiden in the Rhins of Galloway in Wigtownshire The Gaelic name is Port Neasaig

Port Nessock Bay is now all that remains of the western end of a strait that in postglacial times separated the main part of what is now the Rinns of Galloway from three smaller islands to its south There was a ruined pier in the bay in 1790 at which time kelp and samphire were gathered on the coast to the south

The village was planned it was created by Colonel Andrew MacDowall Douall the laird of Logan in 1818 MacDowall erected a quay and bell tower designed by Thomas Telford and a causewayed road leading to them This causeway blocked the view to seaward of the existing houses on the Lower Road Laigh Row whose inhabitants MacDowall expected to move to a new Upper Road in the event they welcomed the shelter it provided from the brisk onshore winds and preferred to stay put though subsequently most of them added a second storey so recovering some of the sea view

Facilities include a village hall which used to be the local Lifeboat Station It is run by a local committee and completely selffunding In recent years it has been used for a range of social events such as weddings and to celebrate Hogmanay and St Andrews Night It is sometimes used for meetings of the Kirkmaiden Community Council There is a tiny parttime post office There is a small market garden supplying local businesses and the public 

For a couple of years until 2006 they also included a newly built cafe with excellent views called the Butterchurn however this was then closed and converted into a private house

The Logan Fish Pond Logan Botanic Garden  Logan House Garden are nearby Logan Fish Pond was also built by Colonel Andrew McDouall originally as a fish larder for Logan House circa 1788 and completed around 1800 with a Keepers Cottage and Bathing Hut which still stand as part of the modern Logan Fishpond Marine Life Centre 2016 the Fishpond  the oldest natural marine aquarium in the UK if not the world  is still a tourist attraction opened again under new management The story of Logan Fishpond can be found at the website of Historic Scotland

Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells
The phrase Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells is a generic name used in the United Kingdom for a person usually with strongly conservative political views who writes letters to newspapers or the BBC in a tone of moral outrage Disgusted is the pseudonym of the supposed letter writer who is a resident of the stereotypically middleclass town of Royal Tunbridge Wells Kent in the southeast of England The term may have originated either with the 1944 BBC radio programme MuchBindingintheMarsh a regular writer to The Times or with an editor of the letters page of a local newspaper the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser

In later times the term has continued to be used to describe conservative letter writers who complain to newspapers about a subject that they morally or personally disagree with It is often used in relation to news stories regarding Royal Tunbridge Wells Some residents of the town have criticised the term as obsolete but several continue to embrace it

A stuffy reactionary image was associated with the town of Tunbridge Wells by the novelist E M Forster in his 1908 book A Room with a View in which the character Charlotte Bartlett says I am used to Tunbridge Wells where we are all hopelessly behind the times Tunbridge Wells was later granted a royal charter by King Edward VII in 1909 and renamed Royal Tunbridge Wells

The BBC radio show MuchBindingintheMarsh first broadcast in 1944 is sometimes stated in newspaper reports to have popularised the term Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells for correspondence to newspapers There were also suggestions that the use of Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells came from one regular contributor of letters to The Times in the early 20th century who would use a particular style of writing to oppose people and organisations who came to his attention Despite being described as the quintessential Englishman because of his writing style and having his letters regularly published his identity was never known because he would only identify himself as Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells However some reports have popularly rumoured that this person was a retired colonel who served in the British Indian Army during the British Raj In 2014 the Kent and Sussex Courier claimed that the originator of Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells was the retired British Army colonel George Thomas Howe who had developed a skill for letter writing about apartheid after five years in the Union of South Africa Reportedly his letters were popular reading and helped to sell newspapers that published them

According to the Royal Tunbridge Wells historian and former newspaper editor Frank Chapman the phrase has a different origin starting in the 1950s with the staff of the former Tunbridge Wells Advertiser During the papers final months of publication the editor Nigel Chapman alarmed at a lack of letters from readers insisted his staff write a few to fill space One signed his simply Disgusted Tunbridge Wells which was then adopted by all future staff letters until the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser ceased publication in 1954 The term Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells was later used to stereotype Royal Tunbridge Wells as being a town of retired British Army colonels who would write such letters to newspapers

Examples of letters of this type sent to the Advertiser may be found which predate these origins such as

The type of letters written with a tone of incensed moral outrage have become commonly described as Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells letters even though the writer may not be from Royal Tunbridge Wells For example the actor Michael Caine once said I dont want to sound like Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells but I do think there should be some sort of national service for young men People writing them have been claimed by commentators to be readers of the Daily Mail despite the original letters not originating in that publication

The magazine Private Eye made regular use of the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells pseudonym to satirise the stereotypical conservative Middle Englander and it became a running joke for several years In 1978 BBC Radio 4 called its new listener feedback programme Disgusted Tunbridge Wells though it was renamed Feedback in 1979 This was following Radio 4 broadcasting the Take It From Here radio series in 1954 where Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells was prominently featured In politics the people behind Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells letters have strong conservative views and are commonly viewed to support the Conservative Party However most UK Independence Party UKIP members in the partys early days were viewed by commentators as being Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells pensioners of which the UKIP leader Nigel Farage stated in 2013  the people in it UKIP and who voted for it were in the main Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells I mean you look down the membership list in 1994 anyone below a half colonel was a nobody

In 1980 the BBC Radio 2 broadcaster Terry Wogan chaired an Its Your BBC meeting at Royal Tunbridge Wells Assembly Hall Theatre A report in The Times suggested the BBC had staged the meeting in the town in the hope that Disgusted would reveal himself

In 2006 the author and magistrate Connie St Louis singled out the disgusted of Tunbridge Wells stereotype as a powerful British middleclass movement saying they are part of the group with the same concerns so they have a sense of belonging

In 2013 Nigel Cawthorne published Outraged of Tunbridge Wells a compilation of letters to the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser that were viewed as being in the style of Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells from the British Library archives Critical review of the book has stated that the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells style displayed an art of letter writing that has continued despite other things in the world changing

Residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells have also expressed displeasure in a manner similar to the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells stereotype in relation to the Waitrose supermarket chain refusing to open a store in the town while neighbouring downmarket towns of Tonbridge and Crowborough both did have one

In 2016 during the United Kingdom referendum on the British membership in the European Union The New York Times used Royal Tunbridge Wells as its base for reporting on the referendum The town was chosen because it was seen as the quintessentially English town due to the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells phrase Although most Americans would not fully understand the reference the town was nonetheless considered a symbol of middle England The town is a Conservative stronghold and was the only council area in Kent to vote by a majority for Remain during Brexit

In 2009 some residents of Royal Tunbridge Wells called the tag inappropriate and stereotypical and asked the town to drop association with it in favour of Delighted of Tunbridge Wells However there was opposition to this campaign by other residents some of whom wrote to newspapers in the Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells style arguing they preferred Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells Local merchants at the towns information centre pointed out that tourists were buying twice as many goods bearing Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells than with Delighted of Tunbridge Wells

Earthrise
Earthrise is a photograph of Earth and some of the Moons surface that was taken from lunar orbit by astronaut William Anders on December 24 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission Nature photographer Galen Rowell declared it the most influential environmental photograph ever taken This had been preceded by the crude 1966 blackandwhite raster image taken by the Lunar Orbiter 1 robotic probe the first American spacecraft to orbit the Moon

Earthrise is the name popularly given to NASA image AS08142383 taken by astronaut William Anders during the Apollo 8 mission the first manned voyage to orbit the Moon

Initially before Anders found a suitable 70mm color film mission commander Frank Borman said he took a blackandwhite photograph of the scene with the Earths terminator touching the horizon AS08132329 The land mass position and cloud patterns in this image are the same as those of the color photograph entitled Earthrise

The photograph was taken from lunar orbit on December 24 1968 1600 UTC with a highly modified Hasselblad 500 EL with an electric drive The camera had a simple sighting ring rather than the standard reflex viewfinder and was loaded with a 70mm film magazine containing custom Ektachrome film developed by Kodak Immediately prior Anders had been photographing the lunar surface with a 250mm lens the lens was subsequently used for the Earthrise images An audio recording of the event is available with transcription which allows the event to be followed closely  excerpt

There were many images taken at that point The mission audio tape establishes several photographs were taken on Bormans orders with the enthusiastic concurrence of Jim Lovell and Anders Anders took the first color shot then Lovell who notes the setting 1250th of a second at  followed by Anders with another very similar shot AS08142384

A nearly fullpage black and white reproduction of Bormans image may be viewed on page 164 of his 1988 autobiography captioned One of the most famous pictures in photographic history  taken after I grabbed the camera away from Bill Anders Borman was the mission commander and notes that this is the image the Postal Service used on a stamp and few photographs have been more frequently reproduced The photograph reproduced in the Frank Borman autobiography is not the same image as the Anders photograph aside from the orientation the cloud patterns differ Borman later recanted this story and agreed that the black and white shot was also taken by Anders based on evidence presented by transcript and a video produced by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio employee Ernie Wright

The stamp issue reproduces the cloud color and crater patterns of the Anders picture Anders is described by Borman as holding a masters degree in nuclear engineering Anders was thus tasked as the scientific crew member  also performing the photography duties that would be so important to the Apollo crew who actually landed on the Moon

On the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission in 2018 Anders described in an interview how the image undermined his religious belief It really undercut my religious beliefs The idea that things rotate around the pope and up there is a big supercomputer wondering whether Billy was a good boy yesterday It doesnt make any sense I became a big buddy of atheist scientist Richard Dawkins

The aspublished photograph shows Earth

In Lifes 100 Photographs that Changed the World wilderness photographer Galen Rowell called Earthrise the most influential environmental photograph ever taken Another author called its appearance the beginning of the environmental movement Fifty years to the day after taking the photo William Anders observed We set out to explore the moon and instead discovered the Earth

In October 2018 the Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature WGPSN of the International Astronomical Union named one of the large craters seen in the photo Anders Earthrise The crater had previously been designated only with letters

In 1969 the US Postal Service issued a stamp Scott 1371 commemorating the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon The stamp featured a detail in color of the Earthrise photograph and the words In the beginning God recalling the Apollo 8 Genesis reading

On April 6 2008 Japan Standard Time the first 1080p highdefinition Earthrise video was captured both a full Earthrise and Earthset video by the JAXA lunar orbiter mission SELENE better known in Japan by its nickname Kaguya After successfully orbiting the Moon for 1 year and 8 months it was crashed intentionally onto the lunar surface at 1825 UTC on June 10 2009

In 2013 in commemoration of the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 8 mission NASA issued a video about the taking of the photograph This computergenerated visualization used data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft which had provided detailed images of the lunar surface that could be matched with those taken every 20 seconds by an automatic camera on Apollo 8 The resulting video recreating what the astronauts would have seen was synchronized with the recording of the crews conversation as they became the first humans to witness an Earthrise The video included explanatory narration written and read by Andrew Chaikin Chaikin writes that all the photographs of the rising Earth on Apollo 8s fourth orbit were taken by Anders

The Earth rose because the spacecraft was traveling over the Moons surface An earthrise that might be witnessed from the surface of the Moon would be quite unlike moonrises on Earth Because the Moon is tidally locked with the Earth one side of the Moon always faces toward Earth Interpretation of this fact would lead one to believe that the Earths position is fixed on the lunar sky and no earthrises can occur however the Moon librates slightly which causes the Earth to draw a Lissajous figure on the sky This figure fits inside a rectangle 1548 wide and 1320 high in angular dimensions while the angular diameter of the Earth as seen from Moon is only about 2 This means that earthrises are visible near the edge of the Earthobservable surface of the Moon about 20 of the surface Since a full libration cycle takes about 27 days earthrises are very slow and it takes about 48 hours for Earth to clear its diameter During the course of the monthlong lunar orbit an observer would additionally witness a succession of Earth phases much like the lunar phases seen from Earth That is what accounts for the halfilluminated globe seen in the photograph

Wolverine train
The Wolverine is a higherspeed passenger train service operated by Amtrak as part of its Michigan Services The line provides three daily roundtrips along the PontiacDetroitChicago route It carries a heritage train name descended from the New York Central Michigan Central

During fiscal year 2015 the Wolverine carried 465627 passengers a 03 decrease from FY 2014s total of 477157 passengers The service had a total ticket revenue of US1896 million in FY 2015 an 03 increase from FY 2014s 1890 million total revenue

Before Amtraks takeover of most privatesector passenger service in 1971 the Wolverine was one of three trains which operated over the Michigan Central route between Chicago and Detroit Under Penn Central operation it continued through SouthWestern Ontario Canada to Buffalo New York Amtrak retained two trains the other was the renamed St Clair and truncated the operation to Detroit but otherwise changed little In April 1975 Amtrak introduced Frenchbuilt Turboliner equipment to the Michigan route and added a third roundtrip A pool of three Turboliner trainsets served the route and the three roundtrip pairs were numbered 350355 train numbers which are still in use today Amtrak dropped the individual train names and rebranded all three Turboliner in common with similar services to St Louis Missouri and Milwaukee Wisconsin The new equipment led to massive gains in ridership topping 340000 in 1975 and 370000 in 1976

The Turboliners became a victim of their own success Although fast and flashy they were unable to reach their design speed of because of the poor quality of the Penn Central track in Michigan The fivecar fixed consists had a maximum capacity of 292 passengers which was often not enough Starting in March 1976 Amtrak began replacing some of the Turboliners with conventional equipment including new Amfleet coaches Individual names returned to the corridor with the heretofore unnamed third train becoming the Twilight Limited The last Turboliners left the corridor in 1981

Amtrak extended the Wolverine and Twilight Limited to Pontiac on May 5 1994 With this change service began at a new station in Detroits New Center Although the Michigan Central Station in Corktown Detroit had closed on January 6 1988 trains continued to stop at a temporary platform just east of the old station Besides Pontiac new stations were opened at Royal Oak and Troy The Lake Cities also began serving Pontiac after the end of Toledo service in 1995

Amtrak dropped individual names again in 2004 and named all three trains Wolverine

Due to the increased ridership on these trains Amtrak tested an additional ChicagoKalamazoo Wolverine frequency September 2 to September 7 2010 This was done to determine all that would be involved in operations should Amtrak decide to initiate such service in the future

The federal government considers highspeed rail service to be rail service which at any time reaches the speed of or higher In 2006 the DetroitChicago corridor was designated by the Federal Railroad Administration as a highspeed rail corridor and in October 2010 the State of Michigan received US150 million from the federal government to increase track speeds to between Kalamazoo and Dearborn In 2016 work to allow higherspeed operation on 41 miles of track between Battle Creek and Jackson including replacing 26000 railroad ties repairing or installing 15 track switches realigning or modifying 29 railroad curves repairing 23 railroad grade crossings and improving road profiles at crossings was completed 

Amtrak owns the stretch of the Wolverines route from Porter Indiana to Kalamazoo Michigan and it is the longest segment of track owned by Amtrak outside of the Northeast Corridor Starting in January 2002 Amtrak began track improvements to increase the allowed speed along this section of track Amtrak trains currently travel at top speeds of along this section of track 

In December 2012 MDOT completed its purchase from Norfolk Southern of of track between Kalamazoo and Dearborn This will make it easier to maintain track and eventually upgrade it to running by late 2017 As part of the purchase agreement MDOT also agreed to doubletrack the line east of Ypsilanti

The Wolverine operates over Norfolk Southern Railway Amtrak and Canadian National Railway trackage

 each Wolverine operates with two General Electric Genesis P42DC locomotives 35 Horizon coaches and an Amfleet cafebusiness class car In the winter Superliners are sometimes used The equipment pool for the Wolverines comprises 14 Horizon coaches and 35 Amfleet cafebusiness class cars one is shared with the Blue Water split across three consists The locomotives usually operate in a pushpull configuration however sometimes both will be at the head end Due to the FRA requirement of positive train control for operations above 79mph locomotives on the Wolverine are required to have Positive Train Control supplied by Amtraks Incremental Train Control System Because of this modification the units equipped with PTC are usually captive to the Michigan services

Between 20162018 Michigan expected to take delivery of new bilevel cars which will displace the Horizons and Amfleets in regular service In addition in early 2014 the Michigan Department of Transportation issued a request for proposal aimed at acquiring additional passenger equipment for use between 20142017 However due to the failure of a critical crash test by the bilevel manufacturer the order was switched to new singlelevel cars built by Siemens that are similar to the Virgin Trains USA fleet 

In September 2014 the state of Michigan reached an agreement with Talgo a Spanish railcar manufacturer to buy two trainsets for the Wolverine at a cost of 58 million The trains had been previously built for the state of Wisconsin before plans for expanded passenger rail service in that state were canceled and the trainsets placed in storage The new equipment will provide a substantial upgrade in passenger amenities over the Amtrakowned railcars used on the route Despite this proposal the Talgo railcars remain at the Amtrak facility in Beech Grove 

Michigan was also involved in a joint purchase with other states to purchase the new Siemens Charger locomotives

Northern sawtail catshark
The northern sawtail catshark Figaro striatus is a littleknown species of catshark and part of the family Scyliorhinidae endemic to northeastern Australia It is demersal in nature and inhabits the upper continental slope at a depth of  A small slender species growing no longer than  the northern sawtail catshark is characterized by a series of dark narrow saddles along its back and tail and rows of prominently enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin and the underside of its caudal peduncle The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN does not yet have enough information to assess its conservation status

The first known specimens of the northern sawtail catshark were collected during exploratory surveys conducted off northeastern Australia in the 1980s and provisionally termed Galeus sp B It was formally described by Daniel Gledhill Peter Last and William White in a 2008 Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO publication in which they also resurrected the genus Figaro until then considered a junior synonym of Galeus The specific epithet striatus means striped in Latin The type specimen is a long adult male caught south of the Saumarez Reefs Queensland on November 17 1985

The range of the northern sawtail catshark is limited to the upper continental slope off Queensland between Rockhampton and Townsville It is found on or near the bottom at a depth of 

Reaching in length the northern sawtail catshark has a firm thin body with a mostly cylindrical crosssection The head is short narrow and flattened with a bluntly pointed snout The eyes are horizontally oval and equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes protective third eyelids beneath each is a narrow ridge and behind is a tiny spiracle The anterior rims of the nostrils are enlarged into triangular outwardpointing flaps The mouth is large and arched with short but prominent furrows around each corner There are around 65 upper and 6165 lower tooth rows each tooth has a narrow central cusp flanked by 35 smaller cusplets There are five pairs of gill slits the fourth and fifth are located over the pectoral fin bases and closer together than the others

The small dorsal fins have blunt apexes and straight to gently convex trailing margins the first is slightly taller but shorterbased than the second The origin of the first and second dorsal fins lie over the rear of the pelvic fins and anal fin respectively The pectoral fins are small and broad with rounded corners The pelvic fins are long and low adult males have slender claspers and a slight apron formed from the fusion of the pelvic fin inner margins The anal fin is elongated its base measuring roughly a tenth of the total length and rather angular The length of the anal fin base exceeds the distance between the anal and pelvic fins and is comparable to the distance between the dorsal fins The caudal fin is short and low with a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe The body and fins are entirely covered by minute overlapping dermal denticles each has an ovoid crown with a horizontal ridge leading to a marginal cusp There are distinctive crests of enlarged spiny denticles along the anterior half of the caudal fin upper margin and beneath the caudal peduncle This species is light grayish brown on the back of the body and tail with a series of dark brown saddles numbering 1016 before the dorsal fins of which a few are wider than the others The flanks underside and fins are whitish

Little is known of the natural history of the northern sawtail catshark Males attain sexual maturity at approximately long

The International Union for Conservation of Nature has noted that there is minimal fishing activity within the northern sawtail catsharks range but presently lacks sufficient information to assess it beyond Data Deficient

Baganuur
Baganuur   Little Lake is one of nine dregs districts of the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar It is subdivided into four khoroos subdistricts

Baganuur is actually a separate city located as an exclave of 620km at the border between the Tv and Khentii aimags It was created as a Soviet military base for the 12th Motor Rifle Division
Later the largest open pit coal mine in Mongolia was built here Baganuur city is one of the largest industrial production locations in Mongolia and would rank among the countrys ten largest cities There are efforts under way to separate its administration from the capital to make it an independent city

Baganuur is the endpoint of a side line of the TransMongolian Railway which connects to the main line in Bagakhangai Due to high operation cost Mongolian Railway had stopped passenger service on the UlaanbaatarBaganuurUlaanbaatar although freight trains still normally transport coal to Ulaanbaatar and other neighbouring towns 
Baganuur is also accessible via 138km of paved road completed in 2004

On December 31 2007 Baganuur became the center of a massive methanol poisoning case that stemmed from substandard production methods of a local vodka manufacturer The poison killed 14 people and hospitalized dozens of others This case led to a complete ban of vodka sales in Ulaanbaatar for several days and also highlighted one of Mongolias food safety problems

Diel vertical migration
Diel vertical migration DVM also known as diurnal vertical migration is a pattern of movement used by some organisms such as copepods living in the ocean and in lakes The migration occurs when organisms move up to the epipelagic zone at night and return to the mesopelagic zone of the oceans or to the hypolimnion zone of lakes during the day The word diel comes from the Latin dies day and means a 24hour period In terms of biomass it is the greatest migration in the world It is not restricted to any one taxa as examples are known from crustaceans copepods molluscs squid and rayfinned fishes trout Various stimuli are responsible for this phenomenon the most prominent being response to changes in light intensity though evidence suggests that biological clocks are an underlying stimulus as well The phenomenon may arise for a number of reasons though it is most typically to access food and avoid predators While this mass migration is generally nocturnal with the animals ascending from the depths at nightfall and descending at sunrise the timing can be altered in response to the different cues and stimuli that trigger it Some unusual events impact vertical migration DVM is absent during the midnight sun in Arctic regions and vertical migration can occur suddenly during a solar eclipse

During World War II the US Navy was taking sonar readings of the ocean when they discovered the deep scattering layer DSL While performing sound propagation experiments the University of Californias Division of War Research UCDWR consistently had results of the echosounder that showed a distinct reverberation that they attributed to midwater layer scattering agents there was speculation these readings may be attributed to enemy submarines By collaborating with biologists from Scripps Institution and the UCDWR they were able to confirm that the observed reverberations from the echosounder were in fact related to the diel vertical migration of marine animals The DSL was caused by large dense groupings of organisms like zooplanktonthat scattered the sonar to create a false or second bottom

Once scientists started to do more research on what was causing the DSL it was discovered that a large range of organisms were vertically migrating Most types of plankton and some types of nekton have exhibited some type of vertical migration although it is not always diel These migrations may have substantial effects on mesopredators and apex predators by modulating the concentration and accessibility of their prey eg impacts on the foraging behavior of pinnipeds


There are two different factors that are known to play a role in vertical migration endogenous and exogenous Endogenous factors originate from the organism itself sex age biological rhythms etc Exogenous factors are environmental factors acting on the organism such as light gravity oxygen temperature predatorprey interactions etc

Endogenous rhythm

Biological clocks are an ancient and adaptive sense of time innate to an organism that allows them to anticipate environmental changes and cycles so they are able to physiologically and behaviorally respond to the expected change Evidence of circadian rhythms controlling DVM metabolism and even gene expression have been found in copepod species Calanus finmarchicus These copepods were shown to continue to exhibit these daily rhythms of vertical migration in the laboratory setting even in constant darkness after being captured from an actively migrating wild population An experiment was done at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography which kept organisms in column tanks with lightdark cycles A few days later the light was changed to a constant low light and the organisms still displayed diel vertical migration Thus suggestions that some type of internal response was causing the migration

Clock gene expression

Many organisms including the copepod C finmarchicus has genetic material devoted to maintaining its biological clock The expression of these genes varies temporally with the expression significantly increasing following dawn and dusk at times of greatest vertical migration seen in this species These finding may indicate they work as a molecular stimulus for vertical migration

Body size

The relative body size of an organism has been found to effect DVM Bull trout express daily and seasonal vertical migrations with smaller individuals always staying at a deeper layer than the larger individuals This is most likely due to a predation risk but is dependent on the individuals own size such that smaller animals may be more inclined to remain at depth

Light

Light is the most common and critical cue for vertical migrationOrganisms want to find an optimum light intensity isolume Whether it is no light or a large amount of light an organism will travel to where it is most comfortable Studies have shown that during a full moon organisms will not migrate up as far or during an eclipse they will start to migrate

Temperature

Organisms will migrate to a water depth with suitable temperatures that best suit the organisms needs for example some fish species migrate to warmer surface waters in order to aid digestion Temperature changes can influence swimming behavior of some copepods In the presence of a strong thermocline some zooplankton may be inclined to pass through it and migrate to the surface waters though this can be very variable even in a single species The marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus will migrate through gradients with temperature differences of 6C over Georges Bank whereas in the North Sea they are observed to remain below the gradient

Salinity

Changes in salinity may promote organism to seek out more suitable waters if they happen to be stenohaline or unequipped to handle regulating their osmotic pressure Areas that are impacted by tidal cycles accompanied by salinity changes estuaries for example may see vertical migration in some species of zooplankton In areas such as the Arctic melting ice causes a layer of freshwater which organisms cannot cross

Pressure

Pressure changes have been found to produce differential responses that result in vertical migration many zooplankton will react to increased pressure with positive phototaxis a negative geotaxis andor a kinetic response that results in ascending in the water column Likewise when there is a decrease in pressure the zoo plankton respond by passively sinking or active downward swimming to descend in the water column

Predator kairomones

A predator might release a chemical cue which could cause its prey to vertically migrate away This may stimulate the prey to vertically migrate to avoid said predator The introduction of a potential predator species like a fish to the habitat of diel vertical migrating zooplankton has been shown to influence the distribution patterns seen in their migration For example a study used Daphnia and a fish that was too small to prey of them Lebistus reticulatus found that with the introduction of the fish to the system the Daphnia remained below the thermocline where the fish was not present This demonstrates the effects of kairomones on Daphnia DVM

Tidal Patterns

Some organisms have been found to move with the tidal cycle A study looked at the abundance of a species of small shrimp Acetes sibogae and found that they tended to move further higher in the water column and in higher numbers during flood tides than during ebb tides experiences at the mouth of an estuary It is possible that varying factors with the tides may be the true trigger for the migration rather than the movement of the water itself like the salinity or minute pressure changes

There are many hypotheses as to why organisms would vertically migrate and several may be valid at any given time 
Water transparency

A recent theory of DVM termed the Transparency Regulator Hypothesis argues that water transparency is the ultimate variable that determines the exogenous factor or combination of factors that causes DVM behavior in a given environment In less transparent waters where fish are present and more food is available fish tend to be the main driver of DVM In more transparent bodies of water where fish are less numerous and food quality improves in deeper waters UV light can travel farther thus functioning as the main driver of DVM in such cases

Due to the particular types of stimuli and cues used to initiate vertical migration anomalies can change the pattern drastically

For example the occurrence of midnight sun in the Arctic induces changes to planktonic life that would normally perform DVM with a 24hour night and day cycle In the summers of the Arctic the Earths north pole is directed toward the sun creating longer days and at the high latitude continuous day light for more than 24hours Species of foraminifera found in the ocean cease their DVM pattern and rather remain at the surface in favor of feeding on the phytoplankton for example Neogloboquadrina pachyderma and for those species that contain symbionts like Turborotalita quinqueloba remain in sunlight to aid photosynthesis

There is also evidence of changes to vertical migration patterns during solar eclipse events In the moments that the sun is obscured during normal day light hours there is a sudden dramatic decrease in light intensity The decreased light intensity replicates the typical lighting experienced at night time that stimulate the planktonic organisms to migrate During an eclipse some copepod species distribution is concentrated near the surface for example Calanus finmarchicus displays a classic diurnal migration pattern but on a much shorter time scale during an eclipse

The biological pump is the conversion of CO and inorganic nutrients by plant photosynthesis into particulate organic matter in the euphotic zone and transference to the deeper ocean This is a major process in the ocean and without vertical migration it wouldnt be nearly as efficient The deep ocean gets most of its nutrients from the higher water column when they sink down in the form of marine snow This is made up of dead or dying animals and microbes fecal matter sand and other inorganic material

Organisms migrate up to feed at night so when they migrate back to depth during the day they defecate large sinking fecal pellets Whilst some larger fecal pellets can sink quite fast the speed that organisms move back to depth is still faster At night organisms are in the top 100 metres of the water column but during the day they move down to between 8001000 meters If organisms were to defecate at the surface it would take the fecal pellets days to reach the depth that they reach in a matter of hours Therefore by releasing fecal pellets at depth they have almost 1000 metres less to travel to get to the deep ocean This is something known as active transport The organisms are playing a more active role in moving organic matter down to depths Because a large majority of the deep sea especially marine microbes depends on nutrients falling down the quicker they can reach the ocean floor the better

Zooplankton and salps play a large role in the active transport of fecal pellets 1550 of zooplankton biomass is estimated to migrate accounting for the transport of 545 of particulate organic nitrogen to depth Salps are large gelatinous plankton that can vertically migrate 800 meters and eat large amounts of food at the surface They have a very long gut retention time so fecal pellets usually are released at maximum depth Salps are also known for having some of the largest fecal pellets Because of this they have a very fast sinking rate small detritus particles are known to aggregate on them This makes them sink that much faster So while currently there is still much research being done on why organisms vertically migrate it is clear that vertical migration plays a large role in the active transport of dissolved organic matter to depth

Prostitution in France
Prostitution in France the exchange of sexual acts for money was legal until April 2016 but several surrounding activities were illegal like operating a brothel living off the avails pimping and paying for sex with someone under the age of 18 the age of consent for sex is 15

On 6 April 2016 the French National Assembly voted to punish customers of prostitutes by a fine of 1500

In the Napoleonic era France became the model for the regulatory approach to prostitution In the 20th century however a policy shift became apparent Brothels became illegal in 1946 and France signed the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1960 France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution see Abolitionism in France

The history of prostitution in France is similar to that in other European countries with alternating periods of tolerance and repression Tolrance gnrale rpression occasionnelle but is marked by the length of time during which the maisons brothels were tolerated Prostitutes were not marginalized but integrated into society where they had a role to play In stories which were often ribald prostitutes would be complicit with other women in avenging men The great Cathedral of Chartres had a window endowed by prostitutes The Prodigal Son in the same way as other windows were endowed by various other trade guilds The Trade Windows

After the period of Roman rule the Visigoth monarch Alaric II 485507 AD seems to be the first French ruler to prosecute prostitution

During the Middle Ages the various authorities civil or noble oversaw prostitution as an institution Regulation was largely at the municipal level restricting activity on certain streets travel liaisons required distinctive dress gold belts or ceinture dore
and opening hours of the maisons 106 or 108 in Paris

Charlemagne 768814 AD was amongst those rulers who attempted to suppress prostitution declaring flogging 300 lashes as a punishment in his capitularies This was primarily aimed at the common man since harems and concubines were common amongst the ruling classes Some idea of the seriousness with which the state regarded the offense is provided by the fact that 300 lashes was the severest sentence prescribed by the Code Alaric Offenders also had their hair cut off and in the case of recidivism could be sold as slaves There is no evidence that any of this was effective
Under Philip II 11801223 an irregular militia the  were created in 1189 to police prostitution and gambling headed by a Roi des Ribauds but abolished by Philip IV 12851314 due to their licentiousness

In the interim Louis IX 12261270 attempted to ban prostitution in December 1254 with disastrous social consequences and widespread protests The decree ordered the expulsion of all women of evil life from the kingdom and confiscation of their belongings but simply drove the trade underground Eventually he was forced to revoke this by 1256 Although still railing against women who were free with their bodies and other common harlots he acknowledged the pragmatic desirability of housing them away from respectable streets and religious establishments and so obliged them to reside outside of the borders of the city walls His resolve to do away with prostitution was affirmed in a letter of 1269 to the regents as he set out on the Eighth Crusade in which he refers to the need to extirpate the evil root and branch The punishment for infraction was an 8 sous fine and risking imprisonment in the Chtelet see below He designated nine streets in which prostitution would be allowed in Paris three of them being in the sarcastically named Beaubourg quartier Beautiful Neighbourhood Rue de la Huchette Rue Froimon Rue du RenardSaintMerri Rue Taille pain Rue Brisemiches Rue ChampFleury Rue Traceputain 
Rue Grattecul and the Rue TirePutain see below

Today this area corresponds to the 1st4th arrondissements clustered on the Rive Droite right bank of the Seine see map These streets associated with prostitution had very evocative if indelicate names including the Rue du Poilaucon or hair of the con from the Latin cunnus meaning female genitalia hence Street of the Pubic Hair or Poil du pubis later altered to the Rue du Plican in the 1st arrondissement near the first Porte SaintHonor and the Rue TireVit PullCock ie penis later the Rue TireBoudin PullSausage now Rue MarieStuart in the 2nd arrondissement near the first Porte SaintDenis It is said that TireBoudin was a euphemism invented for Mary Queen of Scots when she asked after its name and the street is now named after her The nearby Rue GratteCul Scratchbottom is now the Rue Dussoubs and the Rue PuteyMusse Whore who hides there the Rue du PetitMusc by corruption The rue TrousseNonnain fuck nun later became TracePutain TasseNonnain and Transnonain then in 1851 it was amalgamated into the Rue Beaubourg The Rue BailleHo Give Joy is now Rue Taillepain in the 4th arondissement near the Porte SaintMerri

In 1358 the Grand Conseil of John II 13501364 echoing the necessary evil doctrine of Saints Augustine 354430 AD and Thomas Aquinas 12251274 declared that les pcheresses sont absolument ncessaires  la Terre Sinners are an absolute necessity for the country Prostitution remained confined to designated areas as indicated in this decree in the reign of Charles V 13641380 by Hugh Aubriot Provost of Paris in 1367 outlining the areas outside of which prostitutes would be punished according to the ordinance of Saint Louis

Contemporary accounts suggest that this decree was rarely enforced

The appearance of syphilis at the end of the 15th century had stigmatized these houses by the end of the 16th century but their continued existence was confirmed by King Henry IV 15891610

In 1804 Napoleon ordered the registration and biweekly health inspection of all prostitutes State controlled legal brothels then known as maisons de tolrance or maisons closes started to appear in Paris and in other cities and became highly popular throughout the century By 1810 Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels

By law they had to be run by a woman typically a former prostitute and their external appearance had to be discreet Prostitutes working in the maisons or any woman arrested twice for soliciting had to be registered as such Registration involved having their name on a national register and agreeing to abide by the regulations and twice weekly medical examinations
This pattern of regulation rapidly spread throughout Europe partly aided by the Napoleonic occupations

Among the most expensive and best known maisons de tolrance in Paris were

More sordid brothels the maisons dabattage offering quick and dirty services were popular amongst the lowerclass

The 19th century was also the time of several fabulously rich courtesans in Paris with La Pava being the most famous one

During World War I in Paris alone US Army officials estimated that there were 40 major brothels 5000 professionally licensed streetwalkers and another 70000 unlicensed prostitutes By 1917 there were at least 137 such establishments across 35 towns on or close to the Western front

The British Army adopted local codes of ethics when fighting in another country and so allowed troops on rest periods and days off to visit what became termed maisons tolres Such activity was not just tolerated but encouraged for both the young as well as the married men who were missing their wives As the war advanced so did the need and rank of the prostitutes entertained While British troops paid just six pence per day were often found in the lowest priced institutes dominion soldiers from Australia New Zealand and Canada received six shillings and could afford higherclass services British officers preferred to always indulge with armour condoms and took to patronizing German Army officers former prostitutes when the lines of conflict were advancing towards the end of the war with the advantage that they sometimes gained tactical and strategic information as well

It is unknown how many or what percentage of men visited the institutions but the French army recorded over a million cases of gonorrhea and syphilis during the war In 1915 in Le Havre a survey undertaken by the Royal Army Medical Corps counted 171000 uniformed British Army visitors to the brothels in just one street As a result rates of venereal disease began to climb with 23000 British Army men at any time on average during the second half of the campaign hospitalized for treatment with over 150000 British soldiers having been infected by the end of the war The disease at the time had a high social stigma but a particularly bad infection could get a soldier medically discharged from frontline duty even on a temporary basis Syphilis was treated with injections of mercury administered at a hospital over a 30day period thereby guaranteeing escape from the frontline The result was that some prostitutes with particularly bad VD infections could charge more Every British army unit had a sexually transmitted disease clinic where soldiers could gain an ointment consisting of mercury and chlorine to prevent VD infection or receive a urethral irrigation with potassium permanganate after STI exposure

The US Army attitude was different driven by a reformist attitude at home In October 1917 Secretary of War Newton D Baker said

Aided by the American Social Hygiene Organization he closed so called segregated zones close to Army training camps which included closing the notorious Storyville district in New Orleans When the two million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Force had been deployed to France they were guided by a bulletin from AEF commander Gen John Pershing to just say no

This was backed up by additional posters and pamphlets that read You wouldnt use another fellows toothbrush so why use his whore and A Soldier Who Gets a Dose Is a Traitor The US Army had clear instructions on those who did not follow the no indulgence rule US Army regulations required soldiers who admitted to having sex while on leave to submit to chemical prophylaxis that included irrigating the penis Soldiers who did not report for prophylaxis and later contracted VD were subject to courtmartial and possibly a hardlabor sentence while those who contracted disease after treatment only lost pay during treatment Implemented from the first day of training the initiative was so successful that US Army doctors reported that 96 of the cases they treated had been contracted while the soldier was still a civilian

However on debarkation at the designated port of St Nazaire a dispute with French authorities broke out after the AEF placed the Maisons Tolre off limits With the dispute escalating President Georges Clemenceau sent a memo to Gen Pershing offering a compromise American medical authorities would control designated brothels operated solely for American soldiers Pershing passed the proposal to Raymond Fosdick who gave it to Secretary Baker Upon receiving it Baker responded For Gods sake Raymond dont show this to the president or hell stop the war The French later proposed a deal that targeted the Black American troops most of whom were assigned to unloading freight in segregated stevedore battalions again flatly turned down by US authorities But this merely highlighted US differential racial policy as all black troops were required by US Army regulations to undertake prophylaxis when returning from leave whether or not they acknowledged sexual contact

The policy adopted by the US Army worked with far lower rates of VD across their troops compared to French or British and Dominion combatants However after the signing of the Armistice when the US Army could no longer plead military necessity as grounds for curtailing leave VD rates among US Army troops shot up

During World War II Dr Edith Sumerskill raised the issue of Maisons Tolres in Parliament to Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden after the intervention of the British Expeditionary Force Further questions were raised in Parliament after the DDay invasion to ensure such local practises and medical precautions were continued

During the German occupation of France twenty top Paris maisons including le Chabanais le Sphinx and le OneTwoTwo were reserved by the Wehrmacht for German officers and collaborating Frenchmen
The brothels flourished during this time and Hermann Gring visited Le Chabanais as is related in the 2009 twovolume book 19401945 Annes Erotiques by Patrick Buisson

After the war Marthe Richard a town councillor in Paris and former street prostitute successfully campaigned for the closure of all maisons On 13 April 1946 the loi de Marthe Richard was passed with votes of the ChristianDemocratic Party MRP and the Communist Party PCF The latter considered brothels to be bourgeois As a result the legal brothels were closed This serves as a plot point in the first James Bond novel Casino Royale However prostitution remained a legal activity with only its organization and exploitation pimping forbidden

This ended a system in existence since 1804 which effectively made prostitutes less visible without suppressing the trade and thus preservied public morality Prostitute registries were supposed to be destroyed but police kept files till 1960 Roughly 20000 women were affected by this law and approximately 1400 houses were closed Many former brothel owners soon opened htels de passe instead where prostitutes could keep on working but the visibility of their activities was reduced

Critics of French prostitution policy such as Mouvement du Nid question how effective this was its implementation and whether it really closed the maisons For instance they point to the presence of military brothels in Algeria till 1960

In 1958 the Office central pour la rpression de la traite des tres humains OCRTEH was created as a branch of the police to combat pimping and cooperate with Interpol It is under the direction of the Minister of the Interior

France became officially abolitionist in 1960 when it ratified the 1949 UN Convention on the Suppression of Trafficking and the Exploitation of Prostitution

In the debates over prostitution in France abolition was used to refer to both the abolition of laws and regulations that make any distinction between someone involved in prostitution and the general population and the abolition of prostitution itself At that time police files on prostitutes were finally destroyed
However implementation varied considerably locally although prostitution was rarely on the political agenda over the next 30 years Exceptions were the demonstrations of prostitutes rights movements against police harassment in 1975 and periodic calls by individual politicians for reopening the maisons see Maisons closes below
These included that of RPR a former Minister of health 19861988 in 1990 as a public health measure given the concerns about HIVAIDS

State policy has been built on two principles  criminalization and support Criminalization of the exploitation brothels procuring pimping of prostitution and support and reintegration for those exiting However the latter attracted few funds and was largely left to charitable NGOs Only a single position within the Department of Social Services had responsibility for this part of policy and funding
The original intention was that the Departments would set up their own Prevention and Rehabilitation Services but of 100 only 12 were created following the 1960 ordinance and by 1999 there were only 5 run by NGOs
Other state responsibilities have fallen to the womens rights administration
and also to health finance interior foreign and education ministries from time to time

In the new Penal Code pimping became a serious offence if associated with organized crime or barbarity and overall was defined at three levels of severity with increasing fines and prison sentences from five years up to life imprisonment Clients were only criminalized if purchasing from minors under 15 years of age

In 1998 sex tourism was added if offences against minors were committed by French residents outside France

In the 1990s France became increasingly assertive internationally as a champion of abolitionism opposing moves towards liberalization and regulation by the Netherlands and the International Labour Organization
France also opposed the distinction between free and forced prostitution in international discussions Hubert Vdrine the foreign minister asserted Frances position at various international venues such as the protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale and prostitution of children and child pornography 2000 and the Convention on organized crime with the protocol on trafficking Palermo 2000 French policy emphasised along with the International Convention that the real evil was prostitution not trafficking defined as an accompanying evil At the same time Nicole Pry minister for womens rights Secrtaire dtat aux droits des femmes 19982002 included prostitution in her departments campaign on violence against women calling it a form of violence at Beijing5 New York 2000

Active solicitation was also outlawed in the late 1940s Passive solicitation being present with revealing clothes at locations known for prostitution was outlawed in 2003 as part of a package of lawandorder measures by theninterior minister Nicolas Sarkozy in his Domestic Security Bill loi pour la scurit intrieure 2003 or LSI also known as Loi Sarkozy II and had the effect of reducing the visibility of prostitution on the streets
Prostitutes organizations decried the measure which came into force in March 2003 calling it punitive and fated to increase the power of pimps Many prostitutes started to work out of vans a strategy authorities attempted to combat by using parking regulation enforcement

Law number 2016444 visant  renforcer la lutte contre le systme prostitutionnel et  accompagner les personnes prostitues Eng to strengthen the fight against the prostitution system and to support prostituted persons was enacted on 6 April 2016 with effect from 13 April 2016

The most publicised provision of this law is that the buying of sexual acts was made illegal and punishable with a fine of up to 3750 However the bulk of this law is concerned with supporting prostitutes exiting the industry and supporting victims of sex trafficking

In the first six months after the law was enacted 249 men were prosecuted for purchasing sexual acts

It is legal for a man or woman to be a prostitute and sell sexual acts The buying of sexual acts was outlawed in April 2016
Racolage soliciting including racolage passif passive soliciting is prohibited This is defined as standing in a public place known for prostitution dressed in revealing attire and is punishable by up to six months in prison and a fine of 3750
Owning or operating a brothel is illegal

All forms of proxntisme procuring are illegal 
Proxntisme is defined as

France is an abolitionist country  its public policy is the prohibition and eradication of prostitution however at the same time it considers that making it illegal to offer sexual acts in return for goods or services in the context of ones private life is a violation of individual liberty

The issue has been prominent on the French political agenda since the late 1990s responding to international pressures on child prostitution and pornography and trafficking international distinctions between forced and voluntary entry into prostitution rejected by the dominant abolitionist discourse and increasing migration This has been accompanied by increasing discourse on la scurit internally which has gradually become dominant affecting the framework in which prostitution is debated This was heightened in 2002 when JeanPierre Raffarins rightwing government 20022005 succeeded the Gauche Plurielle plural left coalition of Lionel Jospin 19972002 The Jospin construction was that prostitutes were victims and needed to be saved and reintegrated This was a view shared by state feminists ministers delegates and the powerful abolitionist lobby and is reflected in the Derycke report as well as the National Commission on Violence Against Women 
as well as the debates on modern slavery esclavage moderne
These consultations in turn enabled agents of the civil society access to the policy process Very few of these constructed prostitution as a legitimate form of work

At the municipal level there was evidence of prostitutes being constructed as public nuisances that needed to be confined and many mayors of both political groups responded to citizen groups to introduce bylaws restricting prostitutes activities in early 2002 This was fuelled by an apparent increased visibility For instance Franoise de Panafieu UMP delegate 17th arondissement campaigned against street prostitution in the summer of 2002 The commitment to abolitionism prevented specific laws aimed at prostitution which would have been seen as regulation initially so they often used traffic and parking bylaws to drive out workers which ultimately mean that they were moved from welllit busy areas to much more unsafe areas As the discourse shifted from abolitionism to security so did more explicit laws and regulations This disquiet enabled Nicolas Sarkozy to later mobilize public anxiety about security evident in the elections that year in his Domestic Security bill

The cultural context is the concept of gender equality as stated in the preamble to the 1946 and 1958 constitution and which had seen an increasing momentum of political gains for women including the establishment of a womens policy agency in 1974 and a ministry of womens rights in 1981 However a significant gap still exists in terms of economic and employment opportunities Meanwhile immigration policies have become increasingly restrictive and soliciting can result in the removal of a migrants work permit

The 2007 Socialist Party Manifesto calls for holding clients responsible The vague language is due to the fact that such measures remain controversial in the Socialist Party
The Manifesto also calls for repealing the ban on passive solicitation

In 2010 Chantal Brunel an MP in Sarkozys ruling rightwing UMP party and newly appointed head of the equality office 
called for legalizing and regulating maisons closes brothels see Maisons closes below akin to the situation in several surrounding countries claiming that this would make the sex trade safer and transparent She outlined the strategy in her 2010 book Pour en finir avec les violences faites aux femmes An end to violence against women This caused considerable discussion French prostitutes are opposed to this plan to legalize and regulate maisons arguing that it would limit their options to make their own decisionsdozens of French prostitutes have marched to protest the proposal to legalize brothels Instead they demand the repeal of the 2003 law outlawing solication
a demand that Chantal Brunel also supports

In June 2012 the socialist womens minister Najat VallaudBelkacem announced that she wanted to abolish prostitution in France and in Europe

State feminists dominated the discourse in the leftwing Jospin years pursuing an antimaleviolence campaign As Womens Minister Nicole Pry confirmed in her New York speech see above prostitution as a form of male violence was very much part of that State strategy

This influence has waned under the security agenda of the succeeding rightwing governments but is still evident in the new political thinking as stated in MarieJo Zimmermanns UMP 2002 report to the Delegation on Womens Rights on prostitution
in which she echoes the left wing sentiment that the purchase of sex constitutes violence The pervasiveness of this thinking is even found in the budget

As in many other countries debates on the nature and regulation of transactional sex are highly polarized These positions are the familiar ones that define sex work as violence against women on the one hand and those who see the problem as stigmatisation and poor working conditions on the other These result in proposals for either the eradication of prostitution or social reforms The dominant abolitionist faction consists of Catholics family values advocates and sections within feminism and the left As elsewhere the term abolitionism has seen a shift from the abolition of Rglementation to include abolition of sexual slavery

From the abolition of Rglementation and the maisons closes 1946 to the late 1990s there was a broad abolitionist consensus This resulted from a close fit between the government position and the dominant sociopolitical discourse making it acceptable to a broad coalition that included abolitionists secular and religious NGOs politicians from both ends of the political spectrum and most French feminists This was so dominant under the Jospin years as to appear normative and nonideological
and above any philosophical debate
This provides abolitionists access to both the policy process and to resources such as the 2000 UNESCO conference see below which had highprofile support including important leftwing figures such as JeanPierre Chevnement and Sylviane Agacinski who was also married to Lionel Jospin

In the 1990s a number of changes shifted the focus of debates These included an increasing globalization of movements on both parts of the debate Sweden and the Netherlands were moving to change their legislation in two distinct and different directions there was political instability in Eastern Europe and there was also increasing concern about AIDS while state feminists were also playing an increasing part in policy debates There were however occasional dissenting voices such as the debate in Le Nouvel Observateur in 1999 sparked by the Dutch legislation

A manifestation of abolitionism was the declaration of May 18 2000 published in the centreleft Le Nouvel Observateur called Le corps nest pas une marchandise The body is not a commodity This was signed by 35 prominent citizens and demanded that France and Europe affirm their commitment to the abolition of prostitution resulting in a debate covering many aspects of the subject such as choice autonomy voice and agency Signatories included Francois Hollande Robert Hue Dominique Voynet Isabelle Alonso Boris Cyrulnik Franoise Hritier and Antoinette Fouque
That same week the Minister of Labour Martine Aubry proclaimed in the Assemble nationale that France would continue to defend its abolitionist position against prostitution because the commodification of human bodies was not acceptable and a violation of human rights

UNESCO held a conference in Paris on May 16 of that year Peuple de lAbme La Prostitution aujourdhui
organized by Fondation Scelles
an abolitionist NGO which also published Le livre noir de la prostitution a strongly worded attack on the subject of prostitution

In 1999 189 cases of pimping were tried and 137 sentenced to prison Generally the judiciary were satisfied with the existing legislation
although 2000 also saw the creation of a new unit of the Judicial Police using information technology to combat pimping and trafficking Transnational operators proved a problem to the police

State feminism culminated in the Senates new Dlgation Aux Droits Des Femmes Delegation for Womens Rights
initiating an inquiry in 1999 The 2001 report of the Delegation named after its author Senator Dinah Derycke 19972001
was critical of what it saw as the lack of commitment in the fight against prostitution mainly the difference between Frances official abolitionist position and what was occurring in practice Although the report received a favourable reception in parliament initially its political impact was limited Senator Derycke retired due to ill health and died soon after while other pressures diverted the debate into other related measures such as organized crime and trafficking and modern slavery Outside parliament there was a new activism and demand for action led by Bus des femmes
But the focus of the outcry was trafficking with an emphasis on Eastern Europe However the new rightwing government elected in 2002 JeanPierre Raffarin was to completely change the way prostitution was perceived see below

Criticism of the dominant discourse came from prostitute rights advocates health associations such as Cabiria Lyons
AIDS groups and some activists who complained that sex workers were being treated paternalistically and denied voice and moral agency They demanded eradication of stigma and restoration of rights access to health and social services and better working conditions Organizations such as Cabiria 
 and AIDESParis IsledeFrance condemned the UNESCO conference above as stigmatizing

All parties claimed they spoke on behalf of and for sex workers and shared a concern for their welfare while denying their opponents did
Therefore both sides held a position that workers should not be penalized positioned as either victims or legitimate workers

New issues arising in 2002 were local residents complaints and the ascendacy of a law and order discourse on both left and right leading to a heated debate notably the suggestion by Franoise de Panafieu UMP that the see Maisons closes below be reopened
The issue of security became a major issue in the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2002 The catchcry of to save the Republic worked in the favour of the right and President Jacques Chirac and JeanPierre Raffarin who came to power as Prime Minister that year
Nicolas Sarkozy became minister of the interior in the incoming rightwing Rafferin government 20022005 almost immediately announcing a Domestic Security Bill 
and the focus of the debates around prostitution shifted to legislation see Public opinion 2002 below

In justifying these measures Sarkozy claimed large segments of the population were exposed to anxiety and legitimate exasperation Article 42 addressed the protection of women in prostitution considered victims of exploitation and these were amplified by the Minister for Equality in the Workplace Nicole Ameline 20022004 
Sarkozy stated that by criminalizing passive soliciting he was protecting prostitutes and helping them escape organized crime
The Government position was that action against certain activities would improve the quality of life and sense of security of the poor who are likely to be victims of crime Sarkozy stated that the poor supported a tough crime agenda and that the general population wanted a stronger stand on law and order In particular he cited an Ipsos poll suggesting that 80 of people on minimum wage approved of his proposals and that the lower the socioeconomic class the more support
In February 2002 a poll suggested security was the most important issue on peoples minds in an election year and in October 70 of the population considered the proposed measures necessary

The Sarkozy bill both redefined prostitution and transformed policy making solicitation previously a minor offence a serious offence un dlit up to six months imprisonment initially but amended to two with stiffer fines and brought back passive solicitation as a crime Article 50 Passive solicitation had been previously decriminalized by another rightwing government that of Balladur in 1994

Proposed Article 225101 removed the necessity of the police having evidence of soliciting allowing dress or posture to be sufficient He explained that it was inconvenient for the police to have to obtain evidence of active soliciting In the Senate a Government amendment subsequently deleted reference to dress after a popular outcry
Article 50 also criminalized purchase of sex from those considered particularly vulnerable such as illness disability physical or mental deficiency or pregnancy

Furthermore the new legislation allowed for foreigners to have their permits revoked for disturbing public order allowing deportation to become a penalty for solicitation active or passive even if they were legal immigrants It addressed trafficking by defining it and attached penalties In the case of alleged victims of trafficking collaboration allowed them to stay and work till their case was heard If an exploiters were convicted Article 76 they could then receive permanent residence Finally article 52 allowed for annual reports to be published on prostitution in France from 2004 onwards

Reactions included demonstrations and petitions
Criticism came from the left trade unions womens
and human rights and poverty groups who saw this bill which simultaneously addressed begging squatting and assembling in public areas of buildings
as an attack on the poor stating that no one chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute
Sarkozy was accused of exploiting peoples insecurities In the Senate the measures were seen to be street cleaning rather than addressing the causes of social problems and social exclusion and that reconstructing prostitution as a law and order issue would merely drive it underground depriving sex workers from access to services and damaging AIDS campaigns it was stated that noone chooses to be a beggar or a prostitute to live in neighbourhoods with no facilities and no public services It was noted that there was no action to deal with organized crime or those who might be exploiting sex workers

The issue of passive solicitation caused particular concern since it could mean that any woman could be arrested for the way she dressed and it was particularly hard to define The judiciary were equally unhappy with evidence that solely consisted of police testimony and were reluctant to convict
It was suggested that concern for victims for trafficking was hardly consistent with punishing them and that prostitution had become conflated with trafficking The trafficking policy seemed more aimed at the porousness of borders than at actual criminals while migrant sex workers appeared to be particularly discriminated against since they were simultaneously rescued and deported without in any way addressing their vulnerability Calls for aiming trafficking policy at traffickers rather than sex workers came from the Senate Law Commission the Delegations for Womens Rights in the Senate and National Assembly as well as from the opposition

In the Senate hearings into prostitution that year Claude Boucher of Bus des Femmes a sex worker support group described how sex workers sell sex to survive unable to make ends meet on social security or the minimum wage To treat them as criminals she argued would just make them more vulnerable Cette loi nest mme pas une loi dordre moral cest une loi contre les exclus contre les plus vulnrables This law is not even a public morals law it is a law against those who are excluded against the most vulnerable

Sarkozy did not attempt to produce a comprehensive policy on prostitution but rather a quick fix addressing immediate concerns of voters in terms of visibility
In this he succeeded at least in the short term The police reported a 40 decrease in prevalence but also that it had moved to more discreet areas and hours
However the more profound effect was that Sarkozy had changed the framing of sex workers from victims to criminals and tied it to immigration debates focusing narrowly on street transactions This avoided inconveniencing the middleclass clients who might have created more opposition The governmental policy tended to portray all immigrant women in prostitution the most vulnerable as victims of trafficking and exploitation and their pimps as foreigners

Following the law coming into effect 5619 charges of passive solicitation were laid between March 2003 and July 2004 90 of these were women and most from Bulgaria and Albania 40 Nigeria Sierra Leone and Cameroon 35 15 were French nationals another 10 from other areas in Africa and 2 from Asia 
There was a notable increase in foreign workers detained and deported In 2004 the police dismantled many trafficking networks mainly involving Eastern Europe and Africa

While the law referred to protection shelter and reintegration there was no provision made for this according to Cimade an NGO
The results of the law were considered disastrous for the women who were supposed to be protected The effects were largely those of displacement pushing their activities into isolated areas and the 37am timeslot isolated them from service agencies exposed them to violence and destroyed the historical working relationship with the police
A study by Anne Hidalgo and Christophe Caresche Deputy mayors in the office of the Mayor of Paris Bertrand Delano
was especially critical

En amalgamant prostitution libre et prostitution force qui relvent de processus totalement diffrents en victimisant les personnes qui se prostituent sans distinction cette loi lgitime et renforce les violences symboliques physiques policires institutionnelles Elle renforce aussi leur inscurit les obligeant  investir des lieux loigns des regards dautant plus quelle les contraint  travailler davantage puisque toutes ont vu leur clientle se rarfier et par consquent leur revenu diminuer de 50  en moyenne

Sarkozy had made a sharp distinction between the classic prostitution of the traditional French Fille de Joie who he depicted as unproblematic even a cultural icon see Culture and the presence of ces malheureuses filles trangres these poor foreign girls on the streets of France who he depicted as the security threat By rescuing these victims of trafficking and returning them home he proposed to solve the situation He argued that the only way to achieve this was to arrest them and then send them back to their families Si le racolage est reconnu comme un dlit les forces de lordre pourront parce quelles auront commis un dlit ramener ces filles chez elles which he stated to be a humanitarian duty cest un devoir diraije humanitaire que de raccompagner cette personne chez elle I will say it is a humanitarian duty to return such a person to their home

Far be it for me to suggest punishing these poor girls The offense that we are creating must come to their aid  I hope that these women will have a better future than facing degrading encounters night after night

In drawing this distinction Sarkozy made frequent reference to the inability to speak French constructing the issue as a defense of French He suggested that this made them vulnerable to exploitation and that the Police would take them home This last point became a target of those who believed they were being sent back to the conditions that made them leave in the first place

Changes to trafficking policy in 2003 were more influenced by European and international influence than domestic concerns but trafficking was finally defined as well as giving victims residence permits in exchange for testimony Critics doubted the practicality or whether the benefits were equally distributed between the women and the authorities an expression of the tension between human rights and public security

In April 2006 Senator Nicole Borvo PCF attempted to introduce a private bill to repeal the Sarkozy law arguing that it had been ineffective and turned victims into criminals The framework was very similar to the 2001 Deryck report depicting prostitution as violence rather than law and order and seeking punishment of exploiters but also measures for prevention and support
In April 2011 a parliamentary commission report En finir avec le mythe du plus vieux mtier du monde recommended the adoption of the Swedish approach of criminalizing the purchase of sex
The social affairs minister Roselyne Bachelot supported the proposal stating There is no such thing as freely chosen and consenting prostitution The sale of sexual acts means womens bodies are made available for men independently of the wishes of those women Other support came from 
The French sex worker movement STRASS has condemned the proposals
In October and November 2013 French lawmakers began debating a proposal to punish customers of prostitution On December 4 the National Assembly passed a bill fining customers of prostitutes by 268 votes to 138 with 79 abstaining which would impose fines of at least 1500 on clients caught paying for sexual relations Within the National Assembly most of those who supported the bill were MPs from the Socialist Party which dominates the house The law was passed in the National Assembly on December 4 2013 The bill caused considerable controversy in France among politicians and intellectuals some for legalizing prostitution and others wanting it banned The bill was opposed by many sex workers and was rejected by the French Senate in July 2014

Finally on 6 April 2016 the French National Assembly voted to fine customers of prostitutes 1500

Critics say most of the frames nuisance victim deviant security threat in which sex work is discussed in France are constructed without the input of sex workers who are depicted as voiceless and agencyless There are exceptions such as the French lesbian feminist Claudie Lesselier

a polling organization has carried out several surveys on prostitution in France A 2002 telephone survey analyzed French attitudes about prostitution 64 of respondents said that prostitution was a degrading practice for the image and the dignity of the woman or the man 66 of those questioned favored the reopening of the maisons closes brothels  see Maisons closes below 37 wanted the clients to be criminalized 22 wanted the prostitutes to be criminalized and 33 wanted all forms of prostitution to be illegal When analyzed and broken down by age and gender the survey showed that some people gave contradictory answers For example some people appeared to favor both the reopening of the maisons brothels and the interdiction of all forms of prostitution probably believing that both solutions would work as the survey showed that most people were dissatisfied with the existing legal situation Older people and men were more accepting of the idea of having legalized brothels
In the 2006 poll only 14 thought prostitution should be illegal
Poll results reported in 2010 gave 59 in favor of reopening of the brothels and 10 opposed
Liberalization is opposed by abolitionist groups such as Mouvement du Nid

In May 2011 the seventh anniversary of the introduction of the LSI Mdecins du Monde released a very critical report on the effect of the law and called for its repeal

Studies from 2003 estimated that about 15000  20000 women work as prostitutes in France
In 2010 the number of fulltime male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20000  30000 with 80 being foreigners In 2018 it was estimated there were 30000 prostitutes in the country and 90 were foreign

Sex work in France like other countries takes many forms These include street prostitution escort services bars and apartment prostitution Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps while other workers are autonomous prostitutes In some areas such as Lyon or the Bois de Boulogne in Paris sex workers use vans see illustration The most famous prostitution street in Paris the la Rue SaintDenis has been somewhat gentrified in recent years and the prostitutes have been moved further north Escort services where one hires a woman or man for entertainment or companionship but usually including sex are less common in France compared to North America In bars women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual acts Prices are set by the bar owner and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute Pigalle peepshows are well known for practicing such scams Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines Swingers clubs are places where partnerswapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance as well as amateur women and couples who get in without paying the flatrate charge of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay including food drink and unlimited sex sessions with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests

Brothels  remain illegal but operate discreetly and clandestinely Since their official closure in 1946 there have been periodic calls for their reopening In 1990 RPR a former Minister of Health 19861988 suggested reopening them in 1990 as a public health measure A row erupted in 2002 with the proposal by Franoise de Panafieu UMP which divided French feminists with Gisle Halimi denouncing it but lisabeth Badinter seeing it as an issue of the right to dispose freely of ones body

A 2010 proposal by Chantal Brunel for a return to regulated brothels was opposed by French sex workers see Politics above

Meanwhile Spain has exploited the difference between the two countries by opening brothels along the FrenchSpanish border

In 2004 the average earnings of a French prostitute were estimated at 500 a day For SubSaharian prostitutes living in France it was less around 200300 Some barely made 50150 a week

Nicolas Sarkozy recognized that the traditional sex worker was part of Frances national cultural heritage 
Paintings and drawings of maisons closes brothels and prostitution appear frequently in art over the centuries some of which are shown here Some of the best known are scenes in brothels produced by Henri de ToulouseLautrec Edgar Degas and Pablo Picasso among others 
Brassa published photographs of brothels in his 1935 book Volupts de Paris A voluminous illustrated work on the phenomenon is Maisons closes Lhistoire lart la littrature les moeurs by Romi Robert Miquet first published in 1952

Amongst writers depicting the life of women in prostitution in France are Honor de Balzac and Victor Hugo see bibliography

The Muse de lErotisme in Paris devotes one floor to the maisons closes It exhibits Polissons et galipettes a collection of short erotic silent movies that were used to entertain brothel visitors and copies of Le Guide Rose a contemporary brothel guide that also carried advertising The 2003 BBC Four documentary Storyville  Paris Brothel describes the maisons closes

An exhibition about historical Paris brothels took place from November 2009 to January 2010 in an art gallery across the street from the former Le Chabanais

France is a destination transit and a limited source country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking Foreign victims from Eastern Europe West and North Africa Asia and the Caribbean are subjected to sex trafficking Sex trafficking networks controlled by Nigerians Bulgarians Romanians Chinese and French citizens force women into prostitution through debt bondage physical force and psychological coercion including the invocation of voodoo and drug addiction The number of children exploited in commercial sex has increased in recent years Children primarily from Romania West and North Africa and the Middle East are victims of sex trafficking in France The government estimates the majority of the 30000 people in prostitution in France about 90 percent of whom are foreign are likely trafficking victims Trafficking of male victims for sex trafficking has increased Nigerian trafficking networks use migrant and drug trafficking routes through Libya and Italy to transport girls to France

The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks France as a Tier 1 country

Rodney Come Home
Rodney Come Home is the ninth Christmas special episode of the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses first screened on 25 December 1990

Unlike the other Christmas specials this episode is not a oneoff story but sets up story arcs that run throughout the following series As such it could be regarded as the conclusion of the sixth series and the prelude to the seventh series

At the Broadwalk Shopping Centre Albert and Del Boy sell childrens dolls that sing Chinese lullabies

Meanwhile at Parry Print Ltd a hungry Rodney discovers that Cassandra made him a very meagre sandwich for lunch and his new secretary refuses to go out and buy him a hamburger during the lunch break because an important client is due to see him However when he spots Raquel with shopping bags full of delicious food Rodney invites her into his office and they chat about the tour that Raquel has been on since the events of The Jolly Boys Outing and how Rodneys marriage with Cassandra is faring Despite claiming they are happy together Rodney implies that he and Cassandra are experiencing difficulties

That evening Rodney returns home to his flat only to find that Cassandra has not prepared dinner for him and is instead going out to play badminton They argue and Cassandra accuses Rodney of being childish if he expects her to cook for him like a servant from the 1930s Rodney subsequently storms out Meanwhile at Nelson Mandela House Del and Raquel are enjoying a romantic dinner and just as Del is about to proposition Raquel Rodney bursts in and tells everyone that his marriage is over Rodney decides to sleep in his old bedroom but Del tells him that Raquel is sleeping there so Rodney will be sleeping on the sofa

A week later at a nightclub as Del and Raquel dance Rodney is getting drunk with his friends Mickey Pearce and Chris which leaves Del concerned Del tries to make Rodney see sense and return to his wife but Rodney refuses to listen

The next evening back at the flat Del tells Albert that when Rodney took the Trotter van down to the Peckham Exhaust Centre earlier that morning to get it fixed he foolishly arranged a date with an attractive receptionist Tanya following Mickey Pearces advice to make Cassandra jealous When Rodney tells Del Raquel and Albert that he is going to see Honey I Shrunk the Kids with Tanya they try to talk him out of his date but Rodney ignores them and heads off Del then realises that Rodney is deliberately taking Tanya to the cinema opposite Cassandras evening school where he hopes Cassandra will see them together Aware that this will lose Rodney both his marriage and his job Del goes over to Cassandras flat to persuade her not to go to her class and ends up breaking the bad news to her Cassandra is reduced to tears but agrees not to tell her parents

Later back at the flat at midnight as Del tries to remove the voiceboxes from the Chinese dolls he gets a telephone call from Rodney who took Dels advice cancelled his date and has decided to wait at his flat for Cassandra so they can be reconciled Before Del can warn him about what he just did Rodney hangs up and removes the receiver from the machine preventing Del from calling him back Del admits to Raquel and Albert that he told Cassandra and then quickly drives over to Rodney and Cassandras flat Cassandra arrives moments before Del and furiously throws Rodney out Rodney confronts Del over telling on him and sends him home but realises that he himself has been locked out of his home leaving him no choice but to go back to Nelson Mandela House with Del

Pere Marquette Amtrak train
The Pere Marquette is a passenger train operated by Amtrak as part of its Michigan Services on the route between Grand Rapids Michigan and Chicago Illinois It is funded in part by the Michigan Department of Transportation and is train 370 eastbound and train 371 westbound

The train is named for a named train of the defunct Pere Marquette Railway and in turn for Pere Marquette Michigan an early name for Ludington The town was named for Father Jacques Marquette a French explorer of the Great Lakes region

The Pere Marquette was a named train of the Pere Marquette Railway which ran between Detroit and Grand Rapids six times a day When the Pere Marquette Railway was absorbed into the Chesapeake  Ohio Railway in 1947 the name was maintained and extended to Chicago

Amtrak revived the name for its Grand RapidsChicago service on August 5 1984 with financial support from the state of Michigan Initially it served Chicago HammondWhiting New Buffalo St Joseph Bangor Holland and Grand Rapids Service at HammondWhiting ended April 29 2001 although other Amtrak trains still stop there Service at New Buffalo ended October 26 2009 when a new station opened on a different alignment

On November 30 2007 the southbound Pere Marquette collided with a Norfolk Southern freight train in Chicago injuring 71people The National Transportation Safety Board NTSB determined that the probable cause of the collision was the failure of the Amtrak engineer to interpret the signal at Englewood interlocking correctly and Amtraks failure to ensure that the engineer had the competence to interpret signals correctly across the different territories over which he operated The NTSB released its findings on the crash on March 31 2009

The Pere Marquette operates over Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation trackage

During fiscal year 2016 the Pere Marquette carried 89508 passengers a decrease of 66 from 2015 when it carried 95807 passengers Ticket revenue in 2016 was 2906782 a decrease of 44 from 2015s 3040677

During 2008 the ontime performance of train 370 ChicagoGrand Rapids was 336 of train 371 Grand RapidsChicago 135 By September 2010 these figures had changed to 633 and 133 respectively Amtrak owns of this line freight railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern the remainder Track and signal delays and freight train interference make up the majority of delays

In October 26 2009 the New Buffalo Amtrak station was relocated from the CSX trackage to the Amtrakowned alignment closer to the shore of Lake Michigan This new station is ADAaccessible and has a more extensive shelter As a result the Pere Marquette no longer stops in New Buffalo which is served by Wolverine and Blue Water trains The Pere Marquette made a special round trip train tofrom Harbor Shores Golf Course for the 2018 Senior PGA Championship This special train made an additional stop at the HammondWhiting station and terminated at Benton HarborGolf Course station a few blocks away from Harbor Shores

Pullup exercise
A pullup is an upperbody compound pulling exercise Although it can be performed with any grip in recent years some have used the term to refer more specifically to a pullup performed with a palmsforward position

The term chinup traditionally referring to a pullup with the chin brought over the top of a bar was used in the 1980s to refer to a palmsaway overhandpronated grip with a palmstoward underhandsupinated grip being called a reversegrip chinup
In later decades this usage has inverted with some using chin to refer to a pullup done with a palmsbackward position In spite of this chin is still regularly used refer to overhandgrip

The most popular current meaning refers to a closedchain bodyweight movement where the body is suspended by the arms gripping something and pulls up As this happens the wrists remain in neutral straight neither flexed nor extended position the elbows flex and the shoulder adducts andor extends to bring the elbows to or sometimes behind the torso The knees may be bent by choice or if the bar is not high enough Bending the knees or holding your legs out in front slightly may help to reduce swinging

A traditional pullup relies on upper body strength with no swinging or kipping using a forceful initial movement of the legs in order to gain momentum The exercise mostly targets the latissimus dorsi muscle of the back along with biceps rear deltoid and other assisting muscles

In past decades a pullup also included openchain pulling exercises done with a barbell These exercises are now more popularly known as the bentover row in the 1950s and upright row in the 1970s

The name refers to pulling up ones body It can be done with the hands facing any directions from prone to supine

Some have associated a pullup with utilizing an overhand pronated palms facing away grip This includes by the Boy Scouts of America Guinness World Records makes a difference between pullups and chinups according to grip Organizations such as the United States Marine Corps however see pullups including both the overhand and underhand grips

A chin up is bringing the chin up to touch the bar or go over the bar with a supinated palmsfacing grip

Variations of pullups beyond being named for their grip can also be named based on how high the body rises by naming it after the body part that either comes into contact with or passes over the top of the bar A chestup or sternumup for example indicates that the chest or sternum meets the bar requiring extra scapular adduction and depression

Pull ups are a common way to measure the upper body strength of the pulling muscles They are used by the United States Marine Corps as a part of the Physical Fitness Test although marines may also choose to substitute pushups

Pull ups were also used as part of military test in Singapore where the IPPT for NationalService men is used It is also used in the NAPFA test for male students above the age of 14 It was then removed in 2014 with the announcement of a new IPPT format

Indian Army Fitness Test requires eight perfect Chinups along other parameters

Pullups including chins can be done with a supinated neutral or pronated grip often called chinups hammer grip pullups and pullups in order Grips may match each other or be different mixed grip Grips may also rotate throughout the movement such as by doing them on rings rotating handles false grip or pull up handles The range of motion used by trainers can vary The fullest possible range is with straight arms overhead elbow directly above shoulder to pulling when the arms are at the sides elbow directly below shoulder People sometimes only train portions such as avoiding locking out the arms at the bottom or stopping when the headchinneck touch the bar Positions within the range are also trained isometrically as in flexedarm and straightarm hangs for time

The width of the grip may also differ When grabbing and holding the bar during the pullup the hands can be apart at shoulderwidth or wider or narrower enough to touch each other This may make the pullup more difficult and may limit the range of motion compared to the shoulderwidth grip

Pullups also work the brachialis and brachioradialis in the arms These muscles are located near the elbow and help move the forearm The biceps brachii or simply biceps cross the elbow and shoulder joints and work to flex the elbow joint during the exercise They are involved more with an underhand supine grip The long head of the triceps also crosses the shoulder joint and assists in shoulder adduction

Pullups use the teres major a small muscle at the back of the shoulder blade The nearby rhomboids which connect the spine to the shoulder blade play a part too Pullups also use the trapezius along the spine and shoulder and the levator scapulae along the side of the neck These muscles work to elevate and depress the shoulder blade and are sometimes called the shrugging muscles

The deltoid muscles specifically the posterior deltoids also assist

Muscles that attach to and depress the scapulae include the lower trapezius muscle and the pectoralis minor The pec minor also works in conjunction with the rhomboid muscle and levator scapulae to perform downward rotation of the scapulae

Muscles which attach to the scapulae that adduct and extend the arm include the posterior deltoid muscles the teres major and minor stabilizing contribution from some rotator cuff muscles infraspinatus and teres minor as lateral rotators subscapularis as medial rotators

The abdominal muscles stabilize the torso by connecting the rib cage to the pelvis The rectus abdominis along with hip flexors can generate force to lift the lower body up during kipping but can also stabilize the front of the pelvis from drifting away from the sternum just as the erector spinae help to keep the vertebrae from drifting apart in the back The external and internal obliques perform similar roles on another plane able to generate or prevent twisting or sidebending and may help reduce body swinging The transverse abdominis helps to prevent movement in all directions encouraging a neutral position

Pelvic floor muscles hold the organs up and stabilize the pelvis

The muscles of the forearm are also worked by holding the overall body weight improving the strength of the fingers and the forearms muscles creating a strong isometric contraction in these muscle groups

Organizations such as the American Council on Exercise give advice such as care should be taken not to unduly put stress on your shoulder during this exercise Elbow pain due to tendonitis bursitis and ulnar nerve entrapment can occur as a result of excessive pull ups and improper technique

Mycena
Mycena is a large genus of small saprotrophic mushrooms that are rarely more than a few centimeters in width They are characterized by a white spore print a small conical or bellshaped cap and a thin fragile stem Most are gray or brown but a few species have brighter colors Most have a translucent and striate cap which rarely has an incurved margin The gills are attached and usually have cystidia Some species like Mycena haematopus exude a latex when the stem is broken and many species have a chlorinelike odor

Mycenas are hard to identify to species and some are distinguishable only by microscopic features such as the shape of the cystidia Some species are edible while others contain toxins but the edibility of most is not known as they are too small to be useful in cooking Mycena cyanorrhiza stains blue and contains the hallucinogen psilocybin and Mycena pura contains the mycotoxin muscarine

Over 33 species are known to be bioluminescent creating a glow known as foxfire These species are divided among 16 lineages leading to evolutionary uncertainty in whether the luminescence developed once and was lost among many species or evolved in parallel by several species One advantage of bioluminescence may lie in its potential to attract insects that can disperse the mushrooms spores

Alexander Smiths 1947 Mycena monograph identified 232 species the genus is now known to include about 500 species worldwide Maas Geesteranus divided the genus into 38 sections in 1992 providing keys to each for all the species of the Northern Hemisphere Many new species have been discovered since then and four new sections have been proposed Taxonomy is complex as most sections are not truly homogeneous and the keys fail for some species especially those that satisfy some criteria for only part of their life cycle Some sections contain only one species

The name Mycena comes from the Ancient Greek  mykes meaning mushroom Species in the genus Mycena and in Hemimycena are commonly known as bonnets

Hotel Pennsylvania
The Hotel Pennsylvania is a hotel located at 401 Seventh Avenue 15 Penn Plaza in Manhattan across the street from Pennsylvania Station and Madison Square Garden in New York City It is currently the fourth largest hotel in the city

The Hotel Pennsylvania was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad and operated by Ellsworth Statler It opened on January 25 1919 and was designed by William Symmes Richardson of the firm of McKim Mead  White which also designed the original Pennsylvania Station located across the street

Statler Hotels which had managed the Pennsylvania since its construction acquired the property outright from the Pennsylvania Railroad on June 30 1948 and renamed it the Hotel Statler on January 1 1949 Following the sale of all 17 Statler hotels to Conrad Hilton in 1954 the hotel became the Statler Hilton It operated under this name until 1979 when Hilton sold the hotel to developer William Zeckendorf Jr for 24 million The hotel was renamed the New York Statler and was operated by Dunfey hotels a division of Aer Lingus The hotel was sold again for 46 million in August 1983 A 50 interest was bought by Abelco an investment group consisting of developers Elie Hirschfeld Abraham Hirschfeld and Arthur G Cohen with the other 50 bought by the Penta Hotels chain a jointventure of British Airways Lufthansa and Swissair The new owners renamed the hotel the New York Penta and undertook a massive renovation In 1991 Pentas partners bought out the chains stake in the hotel and returned it to its original name Hotel Pennsylvania

The threat of the Hotel Pennsylvanias demolition was first introduced in 1997 when Vornado Realty Trust bought the hotel in a joint venture with Ong Beng Seng a Singaporean hotel developer and financier Vornado and Sengs company then announced on September 25 1997 the formation of a joint venture for converting the hotel into the first Official All Star Hotel The plans were halted by mid1999 as Planet Hollywood sold its stake to a New Jerseybased real estate investment trust

Vornado announced in 2007 that the hotel was to be demolished to make way for a new office building with Merrill Lynch as its anchor tenant Owner Vornado Realty Trust intended to build a building by 2011

In 2006 the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation now the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society was created Shortly after the announcement of Vornados plans the staff of  a magazine which sponsors biennial HOPE hacker conventions at the hotel began investigating possible ways to save the hotel from demolition They were joined by the new Save the Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation whose members included a number of city organizations and politicians to aid in the landmarking of the hotel including the Historic Districts Council Manhattan Community Board 5 and Assemblyman Richard Gottfried In November 2007 Manhattan Community Board 5 voted 218 to have New York City Council landmark the historic hotel However in February 2008 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission denied the request for landmarking

Preservation efforts have proven difficult Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600 noted that while people overseas expressed concern over the fate of the hotel

New Yorkers might not care enough to get involved The hotel was old the rooms werent as big and luxurious as other more modern facilities and New Yorkers simply werent in a position to grasp the importance of such a place since they normally dont need cheap and easily accessible hotels if they already live here

In May 2010 the hotel was again in danger of demolition Manhattan Borough president Scott Stringer gave a conditional approval overruling Manhattan Community Board 5 The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the hotels Cafe Rouge for landmark status based on a request by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society but on October 22 2010 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to designate the cafe as a landmark

On July 14 2010 the New York City Department of City Planning voted unanimously in favor of the construction of the tower On August 23 2010 the NYC Council voted to approve the proposed Uniform Land Use Review Procedure submitted by the building owners

On December 14 2011 Vornado proposed to delay the demolition of the hotel due to market conditions

On March 4 2013 Vornado revealed they were abandoning plans to demolish the hotel and replace it with the office tower The decision was followed by a statement by chairman Steven Roth

Were not going to tear down the hotel In fact were going to invest in it aggressively and try to make it into a really profitable really good hotel for our purposes

Vornado has confirmed they will be renovating and improving the hotel but beyond that not much else is known Preservationists as well as those in the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation would like to see the renovations develop into restorations bringing the hotel back to its 1919 splendor

In March 2018 Vornado Realty Trust renewed special permits with the City Planning Commission to develop the proposed 15 Penn Plaza skyscraper on the Hotel Pennsylvanias site In an April 2018 letter to investors Vornado chairman Steven Roth mentioned the demolition15 Penn skyscraper plan as a continued option but also described Vornado as being at a tipping point with regard to redeveloping the Pennsylvania into a giant conventionentertainment hotel

The hotel has the distinction of having the New York phone number in longest continuous use The number Pennsylvania 65000 2127365000 is the inspiration for the Jerry Gray composition of the same name with lyrics later added by Carl Sigman The most popular version was performed by Glenn Miller with the Andrews Sisters version not far behind

The Cafe Rouge was originally the main restaurant in the Hotel Pennsylvania It served as a nightclub for many years but now operates as a separate venue from the hotel entirely as a multipurpose space It is the only space in the hotel that escaped significant alterations during the buildings massive 1980s renovation

The Cafe Rouge measured  with a ceiling height of  with a main central level and two terraces on either side The terraces were raised  The Caf was designed with a distinctly Italian character Both the wall base and door trim were made of terracotta the walls were artificial limestone and the ceiling was treated to give the effect of old wooden beamed ceilings The ceiling was carefully studied in color to increase the apparent height of the room and the beams of the ceiling had carvings of various designs The east end of the Caf had a large floor to ceiling fountain The Caf had large arched windows running along the exterior wall of the room The arched window design was mimicked on the opposite wall A bandstand was located on the central floor of the room on the exterior wall

In the late 1930s and early 1940s The Caf Rouge had a big band remote connection to the NBC Radio Network and became famous for the performances held inside Multiple artists played inside the Caf  such as The Dorsey Brothers Woody Herman Count Basie Duke Ellington and The Andrews Sisters

One evening in November 1939 while in the midst of a steady longterm engagement at the Cafe Rouge bandleader Artie Shaw left the bandstand between sets and decided he had enough of the band business and all the hype of having become in a year and a halfs time the leader of the most popular big band in the country Shaw essentially quit his own band on the spot the act obliging even the New York Times to comment in an editorial

From 194042 Glenn Millers band also had repeated longterm bookings in the room during the three years of Millers great popularity as a major bandleader of the Swing Era Glenn Miller and his Glenn Miller Orchestra broadcast multiple live radio performances from the Caf some were recorded by RCA Victor Gray Shaws principal orchestrator from 193739 was immediately hired by Miller as a staff arranger when Shaw deserted his band it was during Millers 1940 engagement at the hotel that Gray wrote the popular instrumental tune that immortalized the Hotels telephone number The hotels telephone number appears in the title of one of his bestknown songs Pennsylvania 65000

Les Browns band with its vocalist Doris Day introduced their song Sentimental Journey at the Caf in November 1944

The Caf Rouge is no longer considered a part of the Hotel Pennsylvania business and has a separate address and entrance from the street at 145 West 32nd Street The hotel structure is currently owned by Vornado Realty Trust

In 2007 for the Garden in Transit project adhesive weatherproof paintings of flowers attached to NYC taxicabs were painted inside the Caf

The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission reviewed the Caf Rouge for landmarking status on the basis of evaluation papers created by the Hotel Pennsylvania Preservation Society formerly the Save Hotel Pennsylvania Foundation On October 22 2010 the Caf was rejected as a candidate for landmarking most likely because the 15 Penn Plaza project was approved and the moderate but not destructive alterations of the interior since its construction The 15 Penn Plaza project would have included the demolition of the Caf

Most of the original interior decor remains intact The fountain and beamed ceiling and other architectural details remain though the entire room as well as the ceiling have been painted over in white
Numerous events from the 2013 New York Fashion Week were held in the Cafe Rouge

In 2014 the Caf Rouge was converted to an indoor basketball court known as Terminal 23 to commemorate the launch of the Melo M10 by the Jordan Brand division of Nike It provides a facility for youth and high school players



Contrary to common floor numbering practice there is a 13th floor The hotel states it has 22 floors from street level to the roof plus three additional levels in the penthouse The highest penthouse level is numbered as the 21st floor The discrepancy in floor numbering is due to several mezzaninetype levels that carry names such as lobby mezzanine instead of floor numbers

Toyota F engine
The Toyota F series engine was a series of OHV inline6cylinder engines produced by Toyota between 1955 and 1992 They are known for their high amount of torque at low RPM massive castiron blocks and heads and also their high reliability The F Engine had one of the longest production runs of any Toyota engine The F engines all incorporate overhead valves actuated by pushrods from a gear driven camshaft in the lower portion of the engine The engine was first introduced in the Land Cruiser and in many countries was the only engines offered in the Landcruiser until 1993 Although its commonly badged as the Land Cruiser engine it was used in a variety of other large truck applications as well such as in fire trucks and the Toyota FQ15 trucks It was also used in the FH26 police patrol car based on the RH Super FS20FS50 police patrol cars based on the RS20MS50 Crown the FHJ and FH24 fire trucks both based on the RH Super and the FS35 based on the RS30 Crown and FS45V ambulance based on the MS40 Crown

The F engine is a 39liter 7593kW 105125hp carburated gasoline engine that is capable of 261289Nm 189209lbft of torque at 2000 RPM the difference in power and torque is different depending on the export destination The original design was started in the early 1950s when Toyota had begun to export their vehicles internationally

The F engine block crankshaft and lower end assembly is loosely based on the 193963 GMC L6 OHV 235 engine but with a taller deck rather than the similar but smaller Chevrolet 193763 Gen2 L6 OHV engine and built under license The cylinder head and combustion chamber is derived from the Chevrolet L6 OHV stovebolt engine slightly scaled up The general idea was consumers would feel comfortable with the engine since it was a familiar design and had a proven track record None of the bottom end of the engine is interchangeable with these engines

The F engine replaced the early 34liter B gasoline engine introduced in 1937 not to be confused with the 29liter B diesel engine introduced much later The early B engine was based on the original 192936 Chevrolet Gen1 207 inline6 not the later 193763 Gen2 216 235 etc engine

The updated F engine is a 39liter 7593kW 105125hp carburated gasoline engine that is capable of 261289Nm 189209lbft of torque at 2000 RPM the major difference between the F and the F5 is the oiling system The F5 uses the same oiling setup and configuration as its 2F successor

The second version of the engine called the 2F was introduced in 1975 There are a few differences between the F and 2F ie a larger bore in the 2F removing one oil ring and forcing the oil to travel through the oil filter before the engine

The 3F was introduced in 1985 but did not become available in the United States until 1988 Differences from the 2F engine include a modified cylinder head to reduce warping and separation from inlet and exhaust manifolds the introduction of electronic fuel injection EFI in some markets a vastly improved emissions system and a smaller displacement resulting from a shorter piston stroke The displacement decreased from 42liters to 4liters but the engine power increased by and torque increased by  As a result of these changes to the engine design the redline was increased allowing a wider powerband which made this engine far more suitable for onroad travel

In 1992 the F series engines after almost 45 years finally ceased production In 1993 the F series was replaced by the dual overhead cam DOHC 1FZ series

Due to the low rpm design and cast iron construction of these engines it is not uncommon to see them reach over before needing a major overhaul

Gandantegchinlen Monastery
The Gandantegchinlen Monastery  Gandantegchinlen khiid short name Gandan  is a Mongolian Buddhist monastery in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar that has been restored and revitalized since 1990 The Tibetan name translates to the Great Place of Complete Joy It currently has over 150 monks in residence It features a 265meterhigh statue of Avalokitevara It came under state protection in 1994

The monastery was constructed by order of the 5th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu in 1809 The first temple was the Gungaachoilin Datsan Only one wooden pillar remains from this temple In 1838 the Gandantegchenlin Temple was built along with the private residence of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu The 13th Dalai Lama stayed in the residence in 1904 In 1840 the Vajradhara Temple was built In 1869 the Zuu Temple was built In 1913 the tall Avalokitevara temple was built In 1925 the temple for keeping the remains of the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was built It is now the monastery library

In the 1930s the Communist government of Mongolia under the leadership of Khorloogiin Choibalsan and under the influence of Joseph Stalin destroyed all but a few monasteries and killed more than 15000 lamas

Gandantegchinlen Khiid monastery having escaped this mass destruction was closed in 1938 but then reopened in 1944 and was allowed to continue as the only functioning Buddhist monastery under a skeleton staff as a token homage to traditional Mongolian culture and religion With the end of Marxism in Mongolia in 1990 restrictions on worship were lifted

The original statue made of copper was built after appeals to the Mongolian public its intent was to restore the sight of the 8th Jebtsundamba also known as Bogd Khan who had claimed the title of Emperor of Mongolia The statue was built by Bogd Javzandambas principal minister Chin Wan Khanddorj Russian troops dismantled the original statue in 1938 After the end of the Soviet era the statue of Avalokitevara was rebuilt in 1996 funded by donations by the Mongolian people It features 2286 precious stones and is gilded with gold leaf

Since 1992 the Supreme Leader of the Centre of All Mongolian Buddhists and Abbot of Gandantegchinlen Monastery has been Lama Gabju Choijamts Demberel

The monastery is surrounded by the Gandan ger suburb

The Blue Water is a higherspeed passenger train service operated by Amtrak as part of its Michigan Services The line connects Port Huron Michigan and Chicago Illinois via East Lansing Michigan

The Lansing area home of the Michigan state capitol and Michigan State University was left out of Amtraks original system Beginning in 1973 Amtrak and the state discussed restoring service over the Grand Trunk Western Railway within the state although the new route would join Amtraks other Michigan trains on the Penn Central west of Battle Creek Michigan eschewing the Grand Trunks traditional route to Chicago New stations were built in Port Huron and East Lansing and the state spent 1 million on track rehabilitation Service began September 15 1974 between Chicago and Port Huron with the intention of eventually restoring the Port HuronToronto leg

Amtrak renamed the train the Blue Water Limited on October 26 1975 and reequipped it with Frenchbuilt Turboliner trainsets on May 20 1976 The new Turboliners were capable of but never reached and ran with fixed fivecar consists with an overall capacity of 292passengers The Turboliners were withdrawn on October 25 1981 replaced by conventional locomotives pulling Amfleet coaches

The longdiscussed extension to Toronto finally occurred on October 31 1982 The extended service received the name International Limited the name of an old Canadian NationalGrand Trunk ChicagoDetroitMontreal train Amtrak and Via Rail the independent Canadian Crown corporation rail company jointly operated the International Limited later just International until April 25 2004 when crossborder service was discontinued Massive border delays postSeptember 11 led to falling ridership Amtrak and Michigan agreed to truncate service at Port Huron and bring back the old Blue Water On the Canadian side service ends at Sarnia as part of the VIA Rails Corridor route

With a more favorable intrastate schedule and fewer delays the Blue Water ridership showed immediate improvements carrying 94378passengers in fiscal year 2004 compared to 80890 in FY 2003 Blue Water ridership in FY 2011 totaled 187065 an increase of 180percent from FY 2010s total of 157709 and the highest total ever recorded by the train During FY 2011 the train had a total revenue of 58 million a 223percent increase from FY 2010s total of 47 million

The Blue Water operates over Norfolk Southern Railway Amtrak and Grand Trunk Western Railroad trackage

The DetroitChicago corridor has been designated by the Federal Railroad Administration as a highspeed rail corridor A stretch along the route of Blue Water from Porter Indiana to Kalamazoo Michigan is the longest segment of track owned by Amtrak outside of the Northeast Corridor Amtrak began speed increases along this stretch in January 2002 Ultimately speed increased to

Together with other local painters Gag decorated altars and walls of several churches in the area He and a partner also produced a large panorama with eleven panels on the Dakota War of 1862 One of his paintings of the Battle of New Ulm hangs in the Minnesota Capitol building

Anton Gaag was born in 1859 as the last of five children in his family in Walk now Valcha a hamlet of 15 homes in the county of Tachau Tachov in Bohemia then a province of the AustroHungarian Empire His father George Gaag was a wood craftsman and his mother Theresia Heller was the daughter of a sheepherder This county is now within the Czech Republic

His family immigrated to the United States in 1873 when Gaag was 14 his older sister had earlier emigrated there They first settled in St Paul Minnesota a city on the Mississippi River He changed the spelling of his surname to Gag after some time in the US By the time he was growing up there the city had grown to 30000 people For a time he lived with his older brother Joseph a tailor In the 187576 city directory Gag identified as an artist By 187879 he was working as a cigar maker

In 1880 Gag moved to New Ulm an immigrant community along the Cottonwood River It had many residents who were ethnic German and Bohemian and most of his family had settled here He was befriended by August Schell founder of Schells Brewery The older man acted as a mentor and patron commissioning Gag to paint murals in a guest house

Need for cognition
The need for cognition NFC in psychology is a personality variable reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards effortful cognitive activities

Need for cognition has been variously defined as a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways and a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world Higher NFC is associated with increased appreciation of debate idea evaluation and problem solving Those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards high elaboration Those with a lower need for cognition may display opposite tendencies and may process information more heuristically often through low elaboration

Need for cognition is closely related to the five factor model domain openness to experience typical intellectual engagement and epistemic curiosity see below

Cohen Stotland and Wolfe 1955 in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation identified a need for cognition which they defined as the individuals need to organize his experience meaningfully the need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways and need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world p291 They argued that if this need were frustrated it would generate feelings of tension and deprivation that would instigate active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding p291 though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary p291 Cohen argued that even in structured situations people high in NFC see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity

Cohen and colleagues themselves identified multiple prior identifications of need for cognition citing works by Murphy Maslow Katz Harlow and Asch They distinguished their concept from the apparently similar intolerance of ambiguity proposed by FrenkelBrunswik arguing that NFC does not reflect the need to experience an integrated and meaningful world Contemporary research suggests that Cohens conception of need is however closer to tolerance of ambiguity need for structure or need for cognitive closure than to current ideas of need for cognition For instance studies using Cohens measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get meaning even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information

Building on this work Cacioppo therefore moved away from drivereduction toward measuring individual differences in the selfreward potential of cognitive activity stressing p118 that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a likelihood or tendency rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of tissue deprivation they defined the need for cognition as an individuals tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking p116 and the tendency to organize abstract and evaluate information p124or variously as a stable but individually different tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors or an intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors and exercise their mental faculties or an intrinsic motivation for effortful thought

Cacioppo and Petty 1982 created their own 34item scale to measure the need for cognition Two years later an 18item version was published and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered Recently a 6item version of the need for cognition scale was proposed

People high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments ie via the central route to persuasion whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on peripheral cues such as how attractive or credible a speaker is People low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition

Psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using selfreport tests where research participants answered a series of statements such as I prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that I must solve and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them The results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests

Research has concluded that individuals high in NFC are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to mates College students high in NFC report higher life satisfaction

A study on lucid dreaming found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on NFC than nonlucid dreamers This suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles Researchers have argued that this is because selfreflectiveness or selffocused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition

A number of studies have found moderate correlations between NFC and measures of verbal intelligence One study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with fluid intelligence reasoning ability particularly verbal and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning and a weaker correlation with crystallised intelligence knowledge which had much smaller positive correlations

NFC has been incorporated into Epsteins dualsystem theory of personality called cognitiveexperiential selftheory The theory proposes that people have two information processing systems a rational system and an experiential system The rational system is thought to be logical verbal and relatively unemotional The experiential system is thought to be intuitive based on images and highly reliant on emotion A modified version of the Need for Cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called Faith in Intuition

Research shows that the two systems are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other That is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments In fact individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways When individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions intuitions and images in an automatic way On the other hand those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions intuitions and images Hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more rational than those low in this trait if their faith in intuition is also high Rather their irrational intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition

NFC is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision Both high and low levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment People low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts that is heuristic biases People high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought

High need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks In a commonly used research paradigm participants are asked to memorise a list of related words Recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and nonstudied items Certain nonstudied items are conceptually related to studied items eg chair if the original list contained table and legs People high in NFC are more likely to show false memory for these lures due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related but nonstudied items

A bias associated with low need for cognition is the halo effect a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics eg intelligence People low on NFC are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target People high in NFC still show a halo effect however albeit a smaller one perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the targets attractiveness

NFC has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs specifically epistemic curiosity typical intellectual engagement and openness to ideas


Research has shown that highneedforcognition consumers prefer openended comparative advertising that allows consumers to decide which brand is best

NFC has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs Martin Sherrard and Wentzel 2005 demonstrate that highneed for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity more indepth information and low visual complexity static images rather than animations

Royal Bahamas Defence Force
The Royal Bahamas Defence Force RBDF is the Military of The Bahamas Since The Bahamas does not have an army or an air force its navy composes the entirety of its armed forces Under The Defence Act the Royal Bahamas Defence Force has been mandated to defend The Bahamas protect its territorial integrity patrol its waters provide assistance in times of disaster maintain order in conjunction with the law enforcement agencies of The Bahamas and carry out any such duties as determined by the National Security Council The Defence Force is also a member of CARICOMs Regional Security Task Force The task force has seen action in the United Nations mandate in Haiti 1994

By an Act of Parliament the RBDF became an official entity on 31 March 1980 falling under the Ministry of National Security The Queen of The Bahamas Queen Elizabeth II is CommanderinChief of the Defence Force with her ceremonial role exercised by the Governor General of the Bahamas The Defence Force also has adopted its own system of medals and awards

Former Commodores of the RBDF were

William Swinley RN 197681

Christopher Belton RN 198183

Leon Smith 19831997

Davy Rolle 19972010

The only combat action the RBDF has ever been involved in has been against Cuba On 10 May 1980 the HMBS Flamingo attempted to arrest two Cuban fishing vessels the Ferrocem 165 and the Ferrocem 54 for poaching in Bahamian waters In retaliation two Cuban MiG21s invaded Bahamas airspace and fired on the patrol boat The Cubans sank the ship with their 23mm cannons and fired upon Marines in distress in the water Fenrick Sturrup Austin Smith David Tucker and Edward Williams all Bahamian Defence Force Marines were killed in the attack Fifteen crewmen and the Commander made it safely to Duncan Town on Ragged Island after being picked up by the fishing vessels they had boarded The poachers were convicted in July 1980 and Cuba eventually admitted responsibility paying the Bahamas 10 million in compensation for the incident

The RBDF is a strictly naval force differing from the rest of its Caribbean and British Commonwealth counterparts in there being no regular landbased military formations With about 1600 members however it is the largest of the Commonwealth Caribbean navies

Serving members of the RBDF are assigned to one of six major subsections Headquarters Administration Engineering Supply Operations and The Commando Squadron The Operations Department contains the mobile arms of the RBDF and comprises the main operational units


The Commando Squadron is a sizable force of 500 Special Marine Commandos Training is conducted with US Special Operations Forces and British equivalents such as the Royal Marines in special operations and maritime warfare A common training practice is to have a marine recruit conduct a twomile swim carrying a fortypound rucksack

Several changes in equipment have been seen in the recent history of the RBDF Originally Britishstyle uniforms were worn by RBDF personnel now US Marine Corpsstyle digital woodland camouflage is worn as opposed to the US Army universal camouflage worn by The Royal Bahamas Police Force Drug Enforcement Unit Similarly the first weapons employed by the RBDF were the British Sterling submachine gun and the L1A1 SLR now the USmanufactured M4 carbine and the Heckler  Koch UMP sub machine gun are employed for frontline duties

The M101 105mm Howitzer towed artillery piece is also employed with fifteen guns in RBDF service

There are two career tracks in the RBDF Marine rating  Officer ranks The enlisted personnel ranks range from Marine Seaman to Force Chief Petty Officer The Officer ranks range from Midshipman to Commodore The force is organized and trained along the lines of the British Royal Navy and many of the officers attend British service academies

The Headquarters of the Defence Force are at RBDF Base HMBS Coral Harbour on New Providence Island The commander officer known as The Commander of the Defence Force is Commodore Tellis Bethel Additional bases are located in Matthew Town Inagua and Freeport Grand Bahama

The RBDF uses the British Royal Navy style of rank insignia and all ships carry the title HMBS Her Majestys Bahamian Ship

Due to a lack of ships most RBDF members do not spend time at sea and are used for other military or nonmilitary roles The Defence Force is primarily an armed service whose roles also encompass some aspects of a coast guard as well as a disaster relief agency These roles require Defence Force personnel to assume the duties of
Naval and infantry personnel
Police Officers Peace Officer
Customs Officers
Immigration Officers
Fisheries Inspectors
Emergency Rescue Personnel
Search  Rescue
Sentry
Detention Center security and
Maintenance of Navigational Aids

The RBDF offers a high school course called the Royal Bahamas Defence Force Rangers

Peacekeeping missions have been conducted with the participation of RBDF members in El Salvador and Haiti


The main ships in the force are two Bahamasclass and four Legendclass offshore patrol vessels The latter are the first part of the ninevessel acquisition contract signed with the Damen Shipyards Group in April 2013
Most of the missions consist of antipoaching patrols antidrug patrols immigration enforcement search and rescue or general National Defence missions

Four of the new vessels will be Stan 4207 design four of the new vessels will be Stan 3007 design and the final vessel will be landing craft style transport craft Damen Stan Lander 5612

The Air Wing was formed on November 26 1981 two years after the creation of the defence force Initially three Aero Commanders were purchased from Bahamasair and operated but these were sold off in 1990 In 1992 a Cessna 402 was added with a Cessna 421 soon after By late 2005 the delivery of a Super king Air 350 took place In May 2009 a Cessna 208 Turbine Caravan with floats and a Partenavia P68 were delivered and significantly improved the RBDFs surveillance and transport capabilities

Lewis Feild
Lewis Feild October 28 1956  February 15 2016 was an American former rodeo cowboy and world champion Feild competed on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association PRCA circuit He was the World AllAround Cowboy Champion in 198587 at the National Finals Rodeo NFR He was also the World Bareback Riding Champion from 19851986 The ProRodeo Hall of Fame inducted him in 1992 in the allaround category 

He was born on October 28 1956 to Keith and True Feild in Peoa Utah He was of British and Scandinavian descent Feild was raised near Peoa in the Kamas Valley where Feild saw his first rodeo It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen to watch those cowboys stay on those broncs It was love at first sight said Feild Feild started riding calves after that which he did at his parents ranch in Peoa It was in Ogden at the Golden Spike Rodeo where he rode his first bucking horse It was a junior rodeo and it was not a fullsized horse but it bucked and I stayed on They gave me a buckle for an award  first thing I ever won

When he grew older he attended college With the assistance of an intercollegiate rodeo scholarship he attended Utah Valley Community College now known as Utah Valley University and Weber State University At Utah Valley University he qualified for the National High School Finals Rodeo three times He also earned three National Finals appearances Then in 1980 with some assistance from friends he turned professional

Feild competed on the PRCA rodeo circuit throughout his professional rodeo career He was the World AllAround Cowboy Champion in 198587 and the World Bareback Riding Champion in 198586 at the NFR He won the NFR AllAround Average in 198688 He won the NFR Average in Bareback Riding in 1984 and 1986 Feild became the first roughstock cowboy since Larry Mahan to earn World AllAround titles since 1973 In 1980 he was the PRCA Resistol Rookie of the Year

In the years 1981 1988 and 1991 Feild won the Linderman Award This award is given to the cowboy who works both ends of the arena this means timed events on one side and roughstock on the other side and has the highest earnings Feild was also an established team roper

In 1987 Feild took the record for singleseason earnings in the bareback bronc event to 114657 In that same year he also set a new single rodeo earnings record of 75219 He held the record for singleseason arena earnings until 1986 until Ty Murray set a new record of 213771 In 1990 Feild was the first roughstock contestant to win more than 1 million in his career in the PRCA He was the third cowboy to do it at any level Tom Ferguson did it first and Roy Cooper did it second

According to many personnel Feild was a staple at the Ogden Pioneer Days rodeo in Ogden Utah for as long as they can remember The committee made him the focus of an opening act which lasted around 10 years up until his death He was such an icon to the rodeo that it inducted him into its Utah Cowboy Hall of Fame It also recognized him as the Utah County honoree for the National Day of the American Cowboy Each of these two honors were awarded to Feild inaugurally in Ogden

Someday when rodeo people look back at what Ive done Id like them to say these things that I rode tough I could ride with pain and courage that I was a fierce competitor in the arena but a quiet respectable man outside the gate I just want to be remembered as a cowboy said the softspoken champion That probably says it all

He coached the UVSC rodeo team and lived in Elk Ridge Utah with his wife Veronica He has three children and seven grandchildren 

Feild died of pancreatic cancer on February 15 2016 in Elk Ridge Utah at the age of 59 after battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer His son Kaycee Feild won four World Bareback Bronc Champion titles at the NFR from 2011 to 2014

Hercules and the Arabian Night
Hercules and the Arabian Night is a crossover episode of Disneys Hercules The Animated Series It aired on February 10 1999 featuring characters from Disneys Aladdin franchise including Aladdin Princess Jasmine Jafar and Abu

As Hades goes through his usual job of bringing fresh souls in Pain and Panic tell him that one of the souls is not cooperating The soul in question Jafar approaches Hades and demands to be sent back Hades is at first unconcerned but they find a common ground Jafar tried to overtake Agrabah Hades is trying to overtake Mount Olympus and they both have been defeated by upstart boys They make a bet that they can defeat each others respective nemesis and Hades gives Jafar a new snake staff which turns him into a mortal as long as it remains in his possession Then he orders Jafar to attack Hercules while hes training on Philoctetess island

At said island Phil is trying to teach Hercules not to use just his strength but also his brains from time to time Jafar appears and summons several monsters to go after Hercules Jafar initially gains the upper hand until Hercules picks up Phils statue head house bashes the beasts and proceeds to smash it on Jafar who gets knocked back to the Underworld Hades then decides to send Pain and Panic to Agrabah to take Aladdin out When the minions arrive in the Arabian city they first mistake Abu for Aladdin but the real Aladdin along with his wife Jasmine arrives on Carpet After a scuffle Pain and Panic are about to finish Aladdin off but Aladdin convinces them to look into his lamp by telling them not to look into it and Genies hand punches them all the way back into the Underworld

With this humiliating double defeat Jafar offers the idea of getting Hercules and Aladdin into fighting and killing each other Hades likes the idea and puts the plan into motion by kidnapping Abu from Agrabah and Icarus from Prometheus Academy When Hercules cant find Icarus an old man Jafar in disguise fools him by telling him that a young rogue named Aladdin kidnapped him Later in Agrabah Aladdin and Jasmine are led to believe by Pain and Panic disguised as Hercules that Hercules kidnapped Abu

When Hercules Phil and Pegasus arrive in Agrabah Aladdin Jasmine and Carpet engage them Aladdin gets Hercules to chase him through the alleyways of Agrabah to an old abandoned building and to punch enough holes in the walls to bring most of the house down on top of Hercules While Hercules holds it up Aladdin demands to know where he hid Abu Hercules responds by wanting to know where Aladdin took Icarus This leads Aladdin to realize they have been tricked but before they can work it out the building collapses on both of them While Jafar and Hades believe that the heroes have been destroyed Hercules gets himself and Aladdin out of the rubble They piece together that they were set up and that Hades and Jafar are holding Icarus and Abu in the Underworld Aladdin wants to charge in to rescue them but Hercules thinks of another way

As Hades tells Jafar of his plans for Olympian domination and offers Jafar the Lord of the Dead title in his stead Pain and Panic yell alert them to Hercules and Aladdins impending arrival Jafar is sent to stop them but acting on an idea by Hercules he and Aladdin have swapped their identities fooling Jafar into engaging them with the wrong countermeasures Jafar is unable to stop Aladdin from nabbing the snake staff and tossing it to Hercules who snaps it in half This effect turns Jafar back into a soul and pull him down into the River Styx for good Icarus and Abu have in the meantime escaped and begin punching Hades until he threatens to make them permanent residents

Hercules and Aladdin congratulate each other before Aladdin takes Jasmine Abu and Carpet back to Agrabah telling Hercules that hell make a great hero someday Icarus having bonded with Abu asks Hercules if they can get a monkey


An unusual aspect of this episode is that it indicates that Aladdin and Hercules existed around the same time though one would logically conclude that they lived at least a millennium apart Hercules being from ancient Greece while Aladdin is from the era of the Islamic empires probably of Abbasid Caliphate On the other hand some of Aladdins enemies such as Mechanicles Queen Hippsodeth and Dominus Tusk could easily be the same vintage as Hercules Also during the A Whole New World part in the original 1992 film Aladdin and Jasmine can be seen riding through what could be Greece Another thing to note is that in The Return of Jafar Genie states that he raced with Hercules

Princess Jasmine mentions that she and Aladdin are married indicating this episode takes place after the events of Aladdin and the King of Thieves which would explain Iagos absence in this episode and also explain why Aladdin has the same outfit on which he wore in Aladdin and the King of Thieves this is additionally backed up by the fact that Aladdin appears physically older than his last appearance This is a bit strange though since the episode seems to indicate that Jafar died recently though there was an entire movie and indeed a TV series between his death in The Return of Jafar and this episode It is possible that time passed differently in the underworld and that Jafar had to go through a waiting line before meeting up with Hades as it is mentioned in many ancient texts such as Virgils Aeneid that souls have to wait a long time to cross the river

Oliver Elton
Oliver Elton 3 June 1861  4 June 1945 was an English literary scholar whose works include A Survey of English Literature 1730  1880 in six volumes criticism biography and translations from several languages including Icelandic and Russian He was King Alfred Professor of English at Liverpool University He also helped set up the Department of English at the University of the Punjab Lahore Pakistan

Born at Holt Norfolk on 3 June 1861 Elton was the only child of Sarah and the Reverend Charles Allen Elton 18201887 the headmaster of Greshams School where Oliver was taught by his father until he proceeded to Marlborough College and Corpus Christi College Oxford where he was a scholar from 1880 to 1885 He graduated with a BA with first class honours in Literae Humaniores in 1884

His friends at Oxford included Leonard Huxley Michael Sadler and Dugald Sutherland MacColl whose sister he later married

Eltons first work was as a tutor and lecturer in London while preparing school editions of Shakespeare and Milton He translated Einar Hafliasons Laurentius Saga as The Life of Laurence Bishop of Hlar in Iceland Lrentus Klfsson into English In this he was encouraged by Frederick York Powell whose biography Elton would later publish in 1906

In 1890 he went as a lecturer to Owens College Manchester remaining for ten years During his time there he published a translation of nine of the books of the Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus a study of Michael Drayton and The Augustan Ages 1899 which brought him recognition from the academic literary world Meanwhile he got to know Charles Edward Montague and wrote for the Manchester Guardian

He went to Liverpool in 1901 as Professor of English Literature and stayed till his retirement in 1925 While there he completed two thirds four volumes of his Survey of English Literature and lectured and wrote on Milton Tennyson Henry James Chekhov and others

Cesare Bonventre
Cesare The Tall Guy Bonventre January 1 1951  April 16 1984 was a Sicilian mobster and caporegime for the New York City Bonanno crime family

Born in Castellammare del Golfo Sicily Bonventre was a member of the Sicilian Mafia During the 1960s the New York crime families imported young Sicilian men from Sicily to the United States to work as drug traffickers and hitmen American mobsters soon derisively dubbed the Sicilians Zips due to their fast speech Bonanno boss Carmine Galante brought Bonventre to New York to be his bodyguard Bonventre soon became the unofficial underboss of the Bonanno family Sicilians Bonventres uncle was John Bonventre a former Bonanno underboss Bonventre was also a cousin of the first family boss Joseph Bonanno and Bonanno mobster Baldassare Baldo Amato In 1979 Cesare and Baldassare were arrested for carrying illegal firearms in their car after being stopped by police at the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream New York shortly before the execution of Carmine Galante In April 1981 they were convicted and served two months Ralph Blumenthal wrote in Last Days of the Sicilians The FBIs War Against the Mafia that Cesare identified himself to law enforcement as a pizza man from Brooklyn

He was a regular habituate of his cousin Baldassare Amatos deli run by his family located at Second Avenue and Eightyfourth Street in Yorkville New York The deli had burned down not long before January 1984 but in its place the Amato family built an apartment building with a sleek Italian cafe and restaurant called Biffi Bonventres moniker was The Tall Guy because he stood close to six feet seven inches tall Lean and handsome Bonventre frequented clubs such as The Toyland Social Club and the Knickerbocker Avenue area with other Sicilian mobsters In the book King of the Godfathers Anthony M Destefano writes that there was something about Bonventre that made him stand out from the other ethnic Italians His stylish clothing aviator sunglasses and European man purses embodied Italian couture Bonventre normally wore his shirt unbuttoned with a gold crucifix hanging from his neck

Galante was allegedly murdered for not sharing his drug trafficking profits with the family The hit on Galante required Philip Rusty Rastelli to get approval from the Zips Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano and the other Commission bosses It was later rumored that the Mafia Commission which oversees all the crime families had sanctioned Galantes murder and arranged for Bonventre and Baldo Galantes bodyguards to betray him

On July 12 1979 Bonventre allegedly participated in the murders of Galante and two of his friends He had been dropped off for lunch at Joe  Marys an Italian restaurant in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn After a short while bodyguards Bonventre and Baldo Amato joined Galante Although it was a hot summer day and they were dining on the patio both Bonventre and Amato wore leather jackets presumably to protect themselves from stray bullets and debris Suddenly three men in ski masks appeared on the patio and opened fire on Galante Bonventre and Amato allegedly joined in the attack then disappeared from the scene after the three hitmen Galante and his two lunch companions died A week after the Galante murders Bonventre was arrested by federal agents but he was soon released and was never charged with the crime

Philip Rusty Rastelli succeeded Galante as boss of the family even though he was incarcerated at the time and Joseph Massino became underboss Although some believed Massino was the real power in the family After Galantes death Bonventre was promoted from soldier to capo and joined Salvatore Catalanos Brooklyn crew At 28 Bonventre became the youngest capo in Bonanno family history Bonventre became involved in the importation and drug trafficking of heroin from Sicily into New York pizza parlors known as the Pizza Connection

Bonventre had been on the side of the three capos Alphonse Sonny Red Indelicato Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera a family faction who were planning a coup to take over the family However Bonventre switched sides joining Rastellis faction If Bonventre and the Zips had stayed loyal to Indelicato he would have probably taken over the Bonanno family The ascension of Rastelli as boss triggered a period of discontent and rivalry in the Bonanno family As a result Rastelli and Massino started purging their opponents in the family

In 1984 Massino decided to eliminate Bonventre Bonventres pedigree increasing wealth and fearsome reputation had made him into a threat to Massinos leadership Bonventre controlled the Sicilians the meanest killers in the family Bonventre himself was prone to outbursts of sadistic violence and was suspected of over 20 murders Massino warned Hes a very sharp guy You have to be careful

In April 1984 Bonanno mobsters Salvatore Vitale and Louis Attanasio picked up Bonventre to bring him to a meeting with Rastelli at a glue factory in Wallington New Jersey As Vitale drove the car into the factory Attanasio shot Bonventre twice in the head Surprisingly Bonventre still struggled grabbing the steering wheel and trying to crash the car forcing the two hitmen to fight him off As Vitale steered into the garage Bonventre crawled out of the car Louis Attanasio then killed him on the garage floor with two more shots Bonventres body was hacked to pieces and dumped into three 55gallon glue drums The killers then moved the drums to the fourth floor offices of a trading company in Garfield New Jersey

On April 9 1984 unaware that Bonventre was dead a federal grand jury indicted him and 12 other men on charges of distributing narcotics through the pizza restaurants  the socalled Pizza Connection case On April 17 1984 Bonventres body was recovered FBI agents searching the trading company offices for stolen goods discovered the three drums After the body was recovered it took forensic technicians three months to identify it Bonventre is buried at Saint Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale New York Bonventres widow gave birth to their only son after the murder

Soon after the murder a government informant later claimed that one of Bonventres killers was Bonanno mobster Cosimo Aiello However in October 1984 Aiello was shot to death in the parking lot of a Clifton New Jersey restaurant In January 2004 nearly 20 years after the Bonventre murder federal authorities arrested Louis Attanasio Peter Calabrese and Louiss brother Robert Attanasio Now a government witness Vitale testified against them On September 20 2006 after being convicted of murder Louis Attanasio and Calabrese were sentenced to 15 years imprisonment Robert Attanasio who had cleaned up the murder car received 10 years imprisonment

The Jewish community of Liechtenstein today is a population of 26 people

From 2001 to 2005 an international team of six historians including Dan Michman and Peter Geiger investigated the matter for the World Jewish Congress Their conclusions are following 

In its report the commission concludes that the tiny state did not employ slave workers and no assets belonging to Jewish families were confiscated but the countrys refugee policy was ambivalent 

About 400 Jewish refugees fled during the Nazi era to find safety in the neutral Alpine principality during World War II 235 were accepted but 165 were turned back In addition the principality allowed 144 Jews to become citizens in return for high fees during the Nazi era Most of those new citizens  never lived in Liechtenstein but chose another country The fact of being a Liechtensteiner made it easier for them to establish themselves in a Western country

Even though it was sandwiched between neutral Switzerland and Nazicontrolled Austria Liechtenstein still had some room to manoeuvre Liechtenstein accepted mainly rich Jews who were expected to spend their money in the country or who created jobs by establishing companies in the principality Like most other Western and overseas countries Liechtenstein tightened its immigration laws in 1938 Liechtensteins policy can therefore be compared to that of other countries

The family of Liechtensteins Prince Franz Josef II bought 3 estates taken from Jews in Austria and Czechoslovakia where rented Jewish inmates from a Nazi SS concentration camp near Vienna worked No works of art plundered by the Nazis were traced to Liechtenstein collections

Nuclear Information and Resource Service
The Nuclear Information and Resource Service NIRS is an antinuclear group founded in 1978 to be the information and networking center for citizens and organizations concerned about nuclear power radioactive waste radiation and sustainable energy issues The organization advocates the implementation of safe sustainable solutions such as energy efficiency solar power wind power and plugin hybrids

As of 2007 NIRS claims to initiate largescale organizing and public education campaigns on specific issues such as to bring technical expertise and strategic sense to grassroots environmental groups

In 2000 NIRS affiliation with World Information Service on Energy WISE turned it into an international organization NIRSWISE

The magazine Nuclear Engineering International has said that it runs easily the best website on uranium mining throughout the world
Some of the policies endorsed by NIRS include strict controls on nuclear waste disposal bans on nuclear weapons and new power plants NIRS is opposed to ineffective nuclear waste reprocessing unsafe transportation of nuclear waste and the implementation of largescale nuclear waste repositories like Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository NIRS also does not view nuclear energy as a remedy for climate change

NIRS and WISE have merged their operations and WISE has relay offices in Amsterdam Argentina Austria the Czech Republic India Japan Russia Slovakia South Africa Sweden and the Ukraine The biweekly WISE News Communique merged with the NIRS Nuclear Monitor and covers the resistance movements working against nuclear power worldwide as well as chronicling the failings of the industry Spanish Russian and Ukrainian versions of this newsletter are also printed

Michael Mariotte 19522016 was president and executive director of the Nuclear Information and Resource Service for 30 years He was a wellknown opponent of nuclear power and organised antinuclear activities in Europe after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster Mariotte was a keen supporter of renewable energy and efficient energy use He believed that nuclear power would become obsolete to be replaced by clean energy sources

On 15 May 2007 NIRS issued a report claiming that radioactive scrap concrete equipment asphalt plastic wood chemicals and soil from US nuclear weapons facilities are being released to regular landfills and could get into commercial recycling streams

On 3 August 2004 NIRS issued a report stating that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission may allow the illegal practice of manually shutting down nuclear power plants in the event of fire

On 17 July 2007 regarding the leakage of water from the spent fuel pool of the KashiwazakiKariwa Nuclear Power Plant after the 2007 Niigata earthquake Michael Mariotte spoke on behalf of the NIRS and commented The leak itself doesnt sound significant as of yet but the fact that it went unreported is a concern when a company begins by denying a problem it makes you wonder if theres another shoe to drop

In October 2010 Michael Mariotte executive director of NIRS predicted that the US nuclear industry will not experience a nuclear renaissance for the simple reason that nuclear reactors make no economic sense The economic slump has driven down electricity demand and the price of competing energy sources and Congress has failed to pass climate change legislation making nuclear economics very difficult

NIRS counts the following celebrities among its supporters

Critics accuse NIRS of fearmongering and question the qualifications of NIRS staff to adequately assess the safety of nuclear energy Diane DArrigo Radioactive Waste Project Director lists no training in physics or radiological medicine which might qualify her for expertise is radioactive waste and radiation issues Other fields of study cited among the qualifications of NIRS staff include biology horticulture the history of science and advocacy No NIRS staff member is credited with formal training in nuclear physics or engineering

The organization lists only famous entertainers among its supporters None are credited with training in science or risk management expertise

In a 2008 response to NIRS claims appearing on the website palmbeachpostcom David Bradish of the Nuclear Energy Institute challenged a contention of NIRS Southeast Office Director Mary Olson that A nuclear power plant takes so much water and energy to build it has to run for 15 years to offset its carbon footprint Citing data from the World Nuclear Association Bradish argues it is reasonable to say a nuclear plant takes about one year to offset its energy consumption from its other stages At a 2006 talk before the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development Olson claimed that when fulllifecycle emissions are included the release of carbon dioxide CO2 as the result of making electricity from uranium is comparable to burning natural gas to make electric power Bradish notes I went to both of the cited studies referenced by Olson and found nothing to back up NIRS claim

<doc id="7744284" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744284" title="County Route 16 Suffolk County New York">
County Route 16 Suffolk County New York
County Route16 CR16 is a main thoroughfare through central Suffolk County New York in the United States Its western terminus is at Middle Country Road New York State Route25 or NY25 in Smithtown on the eastern border of the Village of the Branch and its eastern terminus is at Montauk Highway CR80 in Brookhaven near Southhaven The route carries five different names along its length

CR16 begins as Terry Road at an intersection with NY25 From NY25 the road runs to the south near a former concrete factory It then crosses NY347 Several blocks south of NY347 CR16 joins Smithtown Boulevard while Terry Road continues to run south as a road maintained by the Town of Smithtown and crosses the Islip town line into Ronkonkoma A former section of Terry Road exists near NY25A It is unknown how this section connected to the present terminus of Terry Road at NY25 while traversing the surrounding terrain

Of the five roads shared by CR16 Smithtown Boulevard is the only road completely controlled by Suffolk County Not only are there no former sections but there are no sections of the road that branch off as local streets Smithtown Boulevard goes from Smithtown through Nesconset where it serves as the hamlets main street and eventually terminates in Lake Ronkonkoma east of CR93 Rosevale Avenue At one time CR76 Town Line Road was proposed to curve north of the SmithtownIslip town line and terminate between Old Nichols Road not to be confused with CR97 named Nicolls Road and Rosevale Avenue

Along the north and east side of Lake Ronkonkoma is a road known as Lake Shore Drive the northern portion of which consists mostly of CR16 except between Spectacle Lake Road and Schoolhouse Road which is maintained by the Town of Smithtown The east end of this section near Schoolhouse Road has suffered such excessive flooding that it was closed by Suffolk County and turned over to the Parks Department while the rest of it was sold to a local night club on the lake and transformed into part of the parking lot East of Schoolhouse Road however the road crosses the SmithtownBrookhaven town line and runs high along the bluffs of Lake Ronkonkoma until it reaches Portion Road CR16 moves east onto Portion Road while Lake Shore Drive continues south along the lake as a road maintained by the Town of Brookhaven

Portion Road begins at the intersection of Lake Shore Drive Old Portion Road is a former section of Portion Road located just south of that intersection Through Lake Ronkonkoma and western Farmingville CR16 crawls eastward in a hilly region of Long Island as it intersects with Ronkonkoma Avenue Hawkins Avenue CR19 PatchogueHolbrook Road and Holbrook Road before reaching an interchange with CR97 Nicolls Road where the road opens up to four lanes Suffolk County is currently planning to widen the rest of the road to four lanes This section of CR16 once carried the additional name of FarmtoMarket Road

For all intents and purposes Horseblock Road is the main section of CR16 Like Portion Road it once shared the additional name of FarmtoMarket Road Unlike the rest of CR16 Horseblock Roads western terminus is at Middle Country Road NY25 in Centereach Originally Horseblock Road was connected to another street a few blocks west of the current terminus named Mark Tree Road The two sections formed a single road that ran from South Setauket to South Haven The connection between the two streets are cut off by a shopping center on the north side of NY25 between Mark Tree and Eastwood Road It then traverses to the southsoutheast and is cut off by CR97 Nicolls Road Suffolk County Community College and other county facilities in Farmingville and joins up with Portion Road from a frontage road west of Nicolls Road named Leeds Boulevard at the interchange with Nicolls Road The section east of Nicolls Road resumes at Horseblock Place and then joins Portion Road west of Waverly Avenue

Horseblock Road then travels eastsoutheast through Farmingville home of the historic Bald Hill Schoolhouse and Cotten Coverage Insurance Agency intersecting Blue Point Road Granny Road and CR83 North Ocean Avenue and then narrows down to two lanes eventually entering Medford intersecting NY112 the Long Island Expressway at exit65 and CR101 PatchogueYaphank Road It then enters southern Yaphank and Brookhaven where it intersects CR99 Woodside Avenue a road whose construction in the early 1970s lead to Horseblock Roads realignment and then CR21 Yaphank Avenue where it shares an interchange with Sunrise Highway NY27 before terminating at CR80 Montauk Highway in Brookhaven

The segment between Ronkonkoma and South Haven was built by the Works Progress Administration and gave the Portion Road and Horse Block Road southeast of Portion the dual name of Farm to Market Road in the hopes of giving farmers of southeastern Long Island an accessible road to western segments of Long Island 

Though CR16 has run consistently from Smithtown to Brookhaven since the mid1960s this wasnt always the case Many segments have been part of other county roads

East Lake Shore Terrace Drive and Portion Road used to be part of CR19 from the SmithtownBrookhaven Town Line to Waverly Avenue in Farmingville In 1960 this terminus was moved to PatchogueHolbrook Road
The construction of Sunrise Highway in 1957 lead to the realignment of Horseblock Road west of its original eastern terminus with South Country Road former Montauk Highway in South Haven Because the interchange is shared with CR21 the new alignment was originally designated as CR21A
Horseblock Road used to be a western extension of CR56 between Victory Avenue a frontage road along Sunrise Highway that begins at CR46 in Brookhaven and Waverly Avenue in Farmingville In 1964 it was moved only to Victory Avenue The frontage road was mainly unmarked until the 2010s

HMS Cherub was an 18gun Royal Navy sloop built in Dover in 1806 She participated in two major campaigns in the West Indies during the Napoleonic Wars and one major engagement in the Pacific during the War of 1812 all each of which earned her crews clasps to the Naval General Service Medal The Navy sold her in 1820

Commander John Ravenshaw commissioned Cherub in April for the North Sea Cherub is listed among the vessels qualifying for prize money arising out of the battle of Copenhagen On the way there Cherub and detained the Danish ship Neptunus on 30 August Cherub sent Neptune or Neptunus which had been sailing from Stockholm to Holstein into Sheerness Slightly earlier she supported the Swedes at the defence of Stralsund and Rgen

On 29 February 1808 Cherub sailed for the Leeward Islands From April to midJune 1808 Cherub and cruised in company and agreed to share any prizes they captured Around 9 May Cherub captured the privateer schooner Vaillante Dubois master which was armed with swivel guns and small arms Her crew abandoned her and escaped ashore leaving behind one man who was sick and who died the next day Cherub and Nimrod then used the schooner as a tender On 17 May Nimrod captured a Spanish schooner carrying hides cocoa and indigo She was the Esther sailing from La Guayra to Teneriffe Lastly on 22 May Cherub and Nimrod jointly captured a Spanish letter of marque brig after a brief exchange of fire when the British sent in a boarding party in boats after her crew had run her ashore She was armed with two guns and four howitzers but her crew abandoned her before the boarding party arrived She had been carrying a cargo of cocoa from Cumano to Barcelona when the British intercepted her The British were able to retrieve her though not without difficulty Nimrod then took the prizes into St Thomas There the estimates were that the brigs cargo was worth about 20000 and the Spanish schooner about 1200

On 20 November   Cherub  and participated in the capture of Bonetta Intrepid and Mary and Allen The last prize money was paid in 1839 In December Commander Thomas Tudor Tucker transferred from to take command of Cherub

On 23 January 1809 Captain William Maude of returned to his station off BasseTerre Guadeloupe where he had left Cherub to watch the French frigate that was taking shelter there

In early June 1809 Cherub and sailed into the anchorage at BasseTerre to cut out two French frigates lying there under the protection of a fort and some batteries As they sailed in they were subject to fire from shore batteries which had no effect The wind suddenly failed the British vessels which were nevertheless able to extricate themselves from the situation with no losses or damage but no success either

On 18 June and Cherub captured one of the French frigates  At the time of her capture Flicit was armed with only 14 guns but had 174 men on board She had left Guadeloupe in company with another frigate and was sailing to France with colonial produce The second frigate escaped through superior sailing despite Cherub having conducted a long chase captured the second frigate  on 5 July 1809 Latona and Cherub shared the prize money with the other vessels that had formed the blockade of the Saintes Amaranthe Blonde   Julia and 

Next Cherub took part in the invasion of Guadeloupe in early 1810 This time 50 vessels shared in the prize money In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal NGSM with clasp Guadaloupe to all surviving claimants from the campaign

On 1 August 1811 Tucker received promotion to post captain Cherub was reclassed as a sixth rate to permit him to continue in command

Cherub remained on the Leeward Islands station until 3 July 1812 when she returned to England for a refit On this voyage she convoyed some 70 to 80 vessels or 96 Cherub arrived in September and the crew received one months leave apparently all returned to duty even though they had been away from Britain for some years and expected to sail again for more years abroad A newspaper report dated 9 October from Halifax reported that Prince of Asturias from St Marys Straker master which Cherub had recaptured had arrived there The account did not specify either the date of recapture nor arrival

On 19 December 1812 Cherub left Cork with a convoy of 12 vessels eight for Brazil two for Buenos Aires and one for the South Seas Several separated and on 12 January captured Volunteer and the next day another vessel from the convoy Still on 24 January 1813 Cherub still had seven vessels with her

Cherub sailed from Rio de Janeiro on 8 July in company with and  sailing around Cape Horn

On 8 February 1814 Phoebe and Cherub found Essex at Valparaiso They waited off the port for Essex to come out On the afternoon of 28 March Essex sailed but she lost her main topmast and anchored near the shore Phoebe and Cherub also anchored and opened fire The British were armed with long guns which were more effective at a longer range than the American armament of carronades As the British anchored out of effective range of the American carronades the battle was very onesided and lasted for an hour until Captain David Porter of Essex struck his colours with 23 dead and 42 wounded on board On the British ships only five were killed Phoebe and Cherub also captured Essexs tender  which they then used as a cartel to transport their prisoners to New York In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasps Cherub 28 March 1814 and Phoebe 28 March 1814 to all surviving claimants from the battle

On 31 May Phoebe and Essex set sail for England finally anchoring in Plymouth sound on 13 November The Admiralty repaired Essex taking her into service as HMS Essex

Suez Canal Bridge
The Mubarak Peace Bridge also known as the EgyptianJapanese Friendship Bridge Al Salam Bridge or Al Salam Peace Bridge is a road bridge crossing the Suez Canal at ElQantara whose name means the bridge in Arabic The bridge links the continents of Africa and Asia

The bridge was built with assistance from the Japanese government The main contractor was Kajima Corporation

The Japanese grant accounting for 60 of the construction cost or 135 billion yen was agreed to during the visit of thenPresident Hosni Mubarak to Japan in March 1995 as part of a larger project to develop the Sinai Peninsula Egypt bore the remaining 40 9 billion yen The bridge was opened in October 2001

The bridge which has a clearance over the canal and is long consists of a cablestayed main span and two long approach spans

The height of the two main pylons supporting the main span is each The towers were designed in the shape of Pharaonic obelisks

The clearance under the bridge is 70 metres Therefore the maximum height of ships that can pass through the Suez Canal Suezmax is 68 metres above the waterline

The Suez Canal Bridge was part of a major drive to develop the areas surrounding the Suez Canal including other projects such as the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel under the Suez Canal completed in 1981 the El Ferdan Railway Bridge and the Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing

<doc id="7744414" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7744414" title="Customer attrition">
Customer attrition
Customer attrition also known as customer churn customer turnover or customer defection is the loss of clients or customers

Banks telephone service companies Internet service providers pay TV companies insurance firms and alarm monitoring services often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics along with cash flow EBITDA etc because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one Companies from these sectors often have customer service branches which attempt to win back defecting clients because recovered longterm customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients

Companies usually make a distinction between voluntary churn and involuntary churn Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customers relocation to a longterm care facility death or the relocation to a distant location In most applications involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn because it typically occurs due to factors of the companycustomer relationship which companies control such as how billing interactions are handled or how aftersales help is provided

When companies are measuring their customer turnover they typically make the distinction between gross attrition and net attrition Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during a particular period Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called Monthly Recurring Revenue or MRR In the 2000s there are also a number of business intelligence software programs which can mine databases of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support billing disputes or a disagreement over company policies More sophisticated predictive analytics software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn

Financial services such as banking and insurance use applications of predictive analytics for churn modeling because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services business models Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics including retailing telecommunications and payTV operators One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future Some companies want to prevent their good customers from deteriorating eg by falling behind in their payments and becoming less profitable customers so they introduced the notion of partial customer churn

Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability MNP in several countries This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers While mature markets with high teledensity phone market penetration have churn rates ranging from 1 to 2 per month high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3 to 4 per month By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers

Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12 per year by using tactics such as free checking accounts online banking and bill payment and improved customer service However once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention other tactics or approaches need to be explored

Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services This can include ignoring resiliations requests implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation Thus churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates This practice is short sighted and will backfire However it was shown to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers

Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of customer relationship management CRM approaches can impact churn rates Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model This model can take demographic characteristics environmental changes and other factors into account

Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention Using data mining and software one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models One researcher notes that retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs the higher volume of service consumption and customer referrals The argument is that to build an effective customer retention program managers have to come to an understanding of why customers leave and identify the customers with high risk of leaving by accurately predicting customer attrition

In the business context churn refers both to customers migration and to their loss of value So churn rate refers on the one hand to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization or on the other hand to the customers who still receive their services but not as much or not as often as they used to
Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge to be able to anticipate to customers abandon in order to retain them on time reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity
There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data They aim to put at the service of marketing departments and agencies and of all business users the necessary weapons to

There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in customer service in order to reduce customer attrition The International Customer Service Institute has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme

Not all customer attrition is bad For many firms it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers However simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers

Aarni
Aarni has been described as an avantgarde metal band from Finland which consists primarily of Master Warjomaa and occasionally some session musicians Although many sources claim the existence of other band members these may be fictional characters probably created by Warjomaa himself and include a French count born in the 17th century Count of SaintGermain a cartoon character with a Tshirt with Aarnis logo Doomintroll and an old woman Mistress Palm

Aarnis music bears similarities to funeral doom metal in Reaching Azathoth for example and has sometimes similarities to folk metal The Weird of Vipunen Their style has been described as almost orthodox doom metallish LovecraftianJungian Kalevala avantgarde music The band themselves sometimes use the term Chthonic Musick The lyrics of Aarni include varied themes such as Finnish folklore transhumanism Lovecraft paganism parapsychology psychoanalytical theories and mythology The lyrics have been sung in English Finnish Latin and occasionally in Enochian Ancient Egyptian Ouranian Barbaric Swedish and Glossolalic

Aarni was founded in 1998 in Finland by Master Warjomaa occasionally known as Mahatma M Warjomaa Master Warjomaa is also an active member of a doom metal band called Umbra Nihil playing lead guitar Aarni released a demo in 2001 and a split album with Umbra Nihil the following year After a second demo in 2002 Aarni finally released its first fulllength album Bathos in 2004 Aarni was signed to Firebox Recordss subsidiary label Firedoom Music but is now signed to Epidemie Records Aarni released their second album called Tohcoth in February 2008 In late 2008 Aarni also released a CDR EP titled Omnimantia In April 2012 Aarni released a split album with Persistence in Mourning

On Aarnis official website the band section contains four members also referred to as Responsible Cultists as well as information concerning each of them The four members of the band are Master Warjomaa Comte de SaintGermain Doomintroll and Mistress Palm Warjomaa commented on this in a 2004 interview

The number of Aarni is five and five is the number of Aarni Think a while about this and you will see because Aarni consists of four personalities plus me Why four Because Ive chosen to adhere to the Jungian concept of quaternity  four personality types four seasons four equinoxes four elements four stations of the sun four stages of the human life four cardinal directions four Qabbalistic worlds four limbs of the human body four main themes in Aarnis songs four basic human brain circuits of Timothy Learys theory etc Visualize the pentagram representing human existence theres four points combined inruled by the fifth Its all of course symbolic Or is it

Master Warjomaa is the alias of the bands most stable member According to the bands official website Warjomaa was born in 1974 It is stated that he is influenced by Joe Satriani Taoism Camel and H P Lovecraft that he belongs to the Homo Superior species and that his favorite place is Cydonia Along with many other artists Warjomaa has named Black Sabbath Candlemass Hawkwind King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator as his musical influences In a fan interview in June 2006 Warjomaa stated
While I prefer a female unicorn deity to a gaseous alpha male vertebrate of cosmic heft anytime Id rather choose no deity or deities at all I think its high time we stopped worshiping gods and started to aim at becoming gods
Le Comte de Saint Germain translated from French The Count of Saint Germain is one of the members of Aarni His role in the band has been stated as Sensation alchemical processes and keys to secrets It is written that he was born in 1665 and is an exhuman It is not stated whether le Comte de Saint Germain was an actual individual that lived centuries ago or if he is an entirely fictional character It may be possible that le Comte de Saint Germain has something to do with the Count of St Germain an actual count living in the 18th century

Doomintroll has been represented by a cartoonstyle drawing of a person with a very prominent nose a pipe in the mouth the Aarni logo on the Tshirt and a hand sticking up the middle finger According to Aarni he originated in 1998 also the date of the formation of Aarni which would make him 6 years old at the time of the release of the bands first fulllength album It is written that Doomintroll belongs to the Duumipeikko species Duumipeikko roughly translated from Finnish gives Doomintroll This is a reference to the popular Finnish cartoon series Moomin in which Muumipeikko is one of the main characters According to Doomintroll the band wants to support the anarchoshamanistic attitude of moomintrolls

Mistress Palm also referred to as Mrs Palm is the fourth claimed band member She is depicted as a rather elderly woman in an apron holding a dish brush and opening her mouth in dismay She has been thought to be a computer program or artificial phlogistondriven rectoplasm

At the top of the band page is written 41 The motive of this equation is maybe to consider the situation of the 4 declared members and one actual member andor can be a reference to the Jungian concept of quaternity On the news page also referred to as the Unspeakable Tidings the news are listed chronologically However the dates are said to be written in the form corresponding to these in the Discordian calendar These dates follow the DDSSYYYY form as stated on the official website Therefore eg the year 2007 CE is noted as 3173 AM

The lyrics have been sung in English Finnish Latin and occasionally in French Ancient Egyptian Glossolalic Swedish Ouranian Barbaric and Enochian In several songs the lyrics refer to the Cthulhu Mythos

In Squaring The Circle the lyrics say zero equals two This may be a reference to the ideas of Aleister Crowley and similar to the 41 statement on top of the band page of the official website In The Thunder Perfect Mindfuck it is said I am the shameless and I am ashamed as well as I am falsehood and I am truth These could be considered paradoxical and controversial as the Gnostic poem the lyrics seem to be based upon The Thunder Perfect Mind


Demo 2001 was released independently by Aarni in 2001 It was the first CD release of Aarni Its cover features a picture of the Conte de SaintGermain

Persona Mortuae Cutis appears as a cover version of the Slayer song Dead Skin Mask translated to Latin

Aarni  Umbra Nihil Split was released through Firebox Records in 2002



Duumipeikon paluu was released independently by Aarni in 2002

Duumipeikon paluu and Demo 2001 were rereleased together in 2003 and rerereleased as a remaster in late 2008 Duumipeikon paluu translated from Finnish means The Return of Doomintroll

Bathos was released through Firedoom Music a sublabel of Firebox Records on November 8 2004

VV from Umbra Nihil played session drums on the album Oneiroscope means an instrument for watching dreams VITRIOL is an acronym for Visita interiora terrae rectificandoque invenies occultum lapidem in Latin meaning Visit the innermost of the earth and by rectifying what is there you will find the hidden stone The Thunder Perfect Mindfuck refers to the gnostic poem The Thunder Perfect Mind

The Bathos cover was painted by Tuomas M Mkel of the ambient band Jportit based partially on an earlier artwork he had done 
Magister Warjomaa said about it We wanted a colourful cover because I feel very bored with the usual darkhued album art most metal bands choose for some pathetic reason But mainly we wanted that cover because to us it has a spacedout candlylike and pleasing feeling THC green feels such a beautiful color

Pandemia is the name of a song by Aarni that was only released on internet available only on the official Aarni website It was originally recorded in 2002 and was later remixed and released on the internet in July 2003

Tohcoth was released through Epidemie Records on February 19 2008 The Enochian title was taken from the works of Dr John Dee This name comprehendeth the number of all the fayries who are diuels next to the state and condition of man This album featured Sampo Marjomaa as a guest vocalist

West African Gas Pipeline
The West African Gas Pipeline WAGP is a natural gas pipeline to supply gas from Nigerias Escravos region of Niger Delta area to Benin Togo and Ghana It is the first regional natural gas transmission system in subSaharan Africa
The project began in 1982 when the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS proposed the development of a natural gas pipeline throughout West Africa In 1991 a feasibility report conducted by the World Bank on supplying Nigerian gas on West African markets deemed that a project was commercially viable

In September 1995 the governments of four African countries signed a Heads of State Agreement The feasibility study was carried out in 1999 On 11 August 1999 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by participating countries in Cotonou Benin In February 2000 an InterGovernmental Agreement was signed The WAGP implementation agreement was signed in 2003 Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at SekondiTakoradi Ghana on 3 December 2004 Construction began in 2005

The offshore pipeline was completed in December 2006 and was scheduled to start operating on 23 December 2007 but was delayed after leaks were detected in supply pipelines in Nigeria The second delivery deadline was scheduled on 13 February 2008 but regular deliveries were delayed again when one of the contractors of Willbros was shot and killed in Nigeria by armed robbers

Gas deliveries were expected by the end of 2009 after commissioning regulating and metering stations in Takoradi and Tema Ghana Lagos Beach Nigeria Cotonou Benin and Lom Togo in May 2008 However deliveries were postponed again due to an irregular amount of moisture found inside the onshore gas pipeline

The pipeline consists three sections with a total length of  The long offshore section starts at starts the Itoki terminal in southeastern Nigeria and runs through the waters of Benin Togo and Ghana parallel to the coastline approximately to offshore in water depths of between and  The Nigerian onshore section of the pipeline connects the offshore section compressor station at Lagos Beach with the Chevronowned EscravosLagos Pipeline System operational since 1989 It is possible that later the WAGP will be extended to Cte dIvoire and in longer term even to Senegal

The diameter of the onshore section is  The diameter of the offshore pipeline is and the capacity is 5billion cubic meter bcm of natural gas per year The pipeline was constructed by Willbros with Bredero Shaw Ltd applying a concrete coating to the pipeline at its facility in Tema Ghana The precommissioning services were provided by BJ Process and Pipeline Services The total pipeline costs around US974million for which the World Bank provided a guarantee of 50million for Ghana while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provided a 75million political risk guarantee for WAGPo as a whole

The pipeline is owned by West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited WAGPCo a consortium of Chevron 367 Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 25 Royal Dutch Shell 18 Volta River Authority of Ghana 163 Socit Togolaise de Gaz SoToGaz  2 and Socit Beninoise de Gaz SA SoBeGaz  2 The managing director of the company is Walter Perez It is operated by Chevron Corporation

In Ghana provided gas was intended for the Takoradi Power Station at Aboadze near Takoradi operated by Volta River Authority and the Takoradi International Companys TICO As of 2014 however most of the gas was being consumed in Lagos

Environmental group Friends of the Earth has criticized the project after local communities in Nigeria complained it would damage land destroy livelihoods and pollute fishing areas

On August 27 2012 the West African Gas Pipeline was damaged when pirates who had tried to board an oil tanker in an attempt to get away from the pursuing Togolese Navy severely damaged the pipeline with their anchor For nearly a year the supply of gas to Ghana Togo and Benin ceased causing major power supply problems to the affected countries

In the words of the Mayor of Londons office it was a newsletter for Londoners from the Mayor of London It provided information about the policies and services delivered by the Greater London Authority and key issues affecting life in the capital and encouraged participation in current debates and consultation

According to the Mayors Annual Report 200506 the budget for The Londoner was 2882000 of which 632000 came directly from the GLA precept portion of council tax paid by London householders Most of the remaining 2250000 came from advertising and editorial material paid for by Transport for London and the Metropolitan Police Authority

Costing 28 million a year to fund many stated that the publication was expensive propaganda It became the topic of many heated blog articles particularly those who criticised the mayor Ken Livingstone Those targeting the Londoner attack what they saw as political bias for example putting the Venezuela flag on an advertisement for bus travel

The succeeding Mayor Boris Johnson scrapped The Londoner as part of his mayoral manifesto pledge describing it as the Mayors ludicrous Pyongyangstyle newspaper Johnson pledged to use up to 1 million of the saved money to plant 10000 trees

Lehigh Canal
The Lehigh Canal or the Lehigh Navigation Canal is a navigable canal beginning at the mouth of Nesquehoning Creek on the Lehigh River in Eastern Pennsylvania It was built in two sections over a span of twenty years beginning in 1818 The lower section spanned the distance between Easton Pennsylvania and the town of Mauch Chunk presentday Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania In Easton the canal met the Delaware and Morris Canals with which goods could be brought further up the east coast At its height the Lehigh Canal was long

Although the canal was used to transport a variety of products its most significant cargoes were anthracite coal and pig iron Cornerstones of the American Industrial Revolution they defined the character of the towns surrounding the canal

The route consisted of the canals and dammedoff sections of the Lehigh River Boatmen had to navigate their barges periodically from the canal through a lock onto the river or vice versa This design saved time and money while the canal was being built although it made for a slower more difficult trip for canalboat captains

The Lehigh Coal Mine Company LCMC was founded in 1792 a few months after anthracite was discovered at Sharpe Mountain a peak of the Pisgah Ridge near presentday Summit Hill Pennsylvania Its principals secured rights to over before the Lehigh Canal was built The company found it fairly easy to find and mine coal from a pit on the mountainside the coal had to be loaded into sacks and then onto pack animals which carried the coal at least to the Lehigh shore Disposable skiffs known as arks were built from local timber which were manned along the lower Lehigh River rapids Despite many politically connected stockholders and officers the operation was unsupervised by upper management
With no officer willing to manage from the field the LCMC hired contractors or sent out teams this was only sporadically successful in getting coal to Philadelphia Firewood and charcoal were expensive and hard to find in the eastern US by the War of 1812 Before the war the LCMCs record of getting coal to market was so dismal that coal imported from England was cheaper and more readily available The war gave the company an incentive to send another expedition by independent contractors in 1813 After a year they had built five boats but brought only two to market this resulted in another loss for the company The loss was the last straw for many of the companys backers who were unwilling to fund more expeditions despite the two boats bought back by White and Hazard

The Lehigh Coal  Navigation Company its founder Josiah White and Whites protege and partner Erskine Hazard operations managers into the mid1860s established a reputation for innovation White and Hazard researched or invented emerging technologies as needed pioneering industrial innovations including the first wire suspension bridge over the Schuylkill River
The lower canal began as a collection of removed stone obstructions and low rock dams with a system of wooden beartrap locks invented by Lehigh Navigation Company managing partner Josiah White who debugged scale models of the lock design on Mauch Chunk Creek Experiments with the beartrap locks gave Bear Lane an alley in Mauch Chunk off Broadway in todays Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania its name White and partner Erskine Hazard who operated a wire mill foundry and nail factory at the Falls of the Schuylkill needed energy After learning the value of anthracite during the British blockades in 1814 White and Hazard joined a number of Philadelphians in a jointstock venture to build the Schuylkill Canal but quarreled with those on the board of managers who did not favor rapid development They learned that the managers of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company were willing to option their rights because of their longterm inability to make a profit by transporting anthracite nearly from Pisgah Ridge The Lehigh Navigation Company held a charter to improve the navigability of the Lehigh River but had accomplished little and the charter would expire in 1817 White and Hazard made a proposal specifying improvements for downriver navigation only and received a charter giving the company ownership of the river in March 1818 The charter had a fallback provision allowing the legislature to require improvements enabling twoway navigation

Sometimes called The Stone Coal Turnpike the lower canal  was built by the Lehigh Navigation Company as a toll road to supply coal to Eastern seaboard cities between 1818 and 1820 downriver traffic only It was rebuilt with locks supporting twoway traffic between 1827 and 1829 by the Lehigh Coal  Navigation Company and remained in operation until 1931 The lower canal connected the eastern part of the southern Coal Region to the Delaware River basin primarily the Panther Creek Valley Nesquehoning Creek Valley and mines in Beaver Meadows and along Black Creek connecting via Penn Haven Junction to the canal head at Mauch Chunk now Jim Thorpe Pennsylvania 
The lower canal began below Packers Dam A wing wall projected into the upper pool to create slack water next to the loading docks at the same level as the top of the first guard dam That dam known as Dam 1 was downstream of Broadway opposite Flagstaff Hill and the crosscanal Bear Mountain for which Mauch Chunk was named The 44 lift locks begin with Lock 1 at the dam This was a weighing lock using a platform which lifted a barge and weighed the boat and its load Each nonLCNC barge on the canal was recorded Empty weights were subtracted and tolls were assessed by the ton per mile traveled Most of the 44 locks on the descent to Easton PA were spillway variants of Whites beartrap lock When tipped or triggered they released several acrefeet creating a wave to raise the water level as the canal boat sank downriver The canal carried central Lehigh Valley anthracite to northeastern urban markets particularly Philadelphia Trenton and Wilmington and supporting new industry in Bristol Allentown and Bethlehem Pennsylvania with the Morris and Delaware and Raritan Canals and a number of railroads The privately funded canal became part of the Pennsylvania Canal system a complex of canals towpaths and eventually railroads It was last used for cargo in 1942 and the LCN Company was sold to Pennsylvania for preservation and recreational use in 1964 Portions of the canal and the later rail lines flanking it are part of the Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor a multiuse rail trail

The lower canal improvements were initially designed and engineered by LCN founder Josiah White after the company become disenchanted with the Schuylkill Canals board of directors By the winter of 1814 the company was interested in transporting Lehigh Valley coal to Philadelphia

By late 1822 skepticism about anthracite was waning The cost of building an ark for every load of coal delivered to the Philadelphia docks in 1822 as LCN operations were hitting their stride worried the companys board of directors By mid1822 managing director Josiah White was consulting with veteran ErieCanal lock engineer Canvass White By late in the year White had shifted construction efforts from improving the oneway system begun in 1818 to a test project on the four upper dams of the canal The project involved twoway dams and locks with a wider lift channel and lengths of over  capable of taking a steam tug and a coastal cargo ship from from the Delaware to the slackwater pool at Mauch Chunk In 1823 White and Hazard proposed a plan to the Pennsylvania legislature

In 1823 after building and testing four locks Josiah White made a proposal to the Pennsylvania legislature to continue the improvements down the Lehigh River His plan included locks suitable for a coastal schooner and towing steam tug the types of boats which dominated ports along the of the Delaware River controlled by the LCN The following year the legislature rejected his proposal lumber and timber interests feared that damming would prevent them from rafting logs on the rivers to local sawmills White and Hazard scrambled to increase mine production while producing enough lumber for arks to send their coal along the Delaware to Philadelphia In 1827 a revision to the Main Line of Public Works funded the promised Delaware Canal The LCN began converting the canal to support twoway operation work which continued into 1829 In 1831 the LCN stopped making oneway arks and began building large durable barges expecting their return via a connection with the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal in Easton

The expanded Lehigh Canal extended  between Mauch Chunk and Easton Its 52 locks eight guard locks eight dams and six aqueducts allowed the waterway to rise over in elevation A weigh lock south of Mauch Chunk determined canalboat fees A cableferry connection across the Delaware River to the Morris Canal and through New Jersey created a moredirect route from the Lehigh Canal to New York City To the south the Delaware and Raritan Canal had a complementary canal built along the east bank of the Delaware

Inspired by the successful transport of freight over the Allegheny Front escarpment via the Allegheny Portage Railroad system during the mid1830s the business community and the legislature sought a extension The Upper Lehigh Canal designed by Canvass White was built from 1837 to 1843 as authorized by the 1837 revision of the Main Line of Public Works

The upper Lehigh was a turbulent river with steep sides a large portion was in a ravine the Lehigh Gorge The upper canal rose over in elevation to the Mauch Chunk slackwater pool Unlike the lower canal where most locks lifted less than in easy stages the uppercanal design relied on deeplift locks The maximum lift on the lower canal was less than  but the uppercanal locks lifted a maximum of  this is comparable to the lift of the lower canal in a bit over half the distance using less than as many locks per mile The upper canal designs 20 dams 29 locks and a number of reservoirs provided working flow even in dry summers 
The project included four major construction hurdles and three new railroad projects for which LCN created a new subsidiary the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad LHS From north to south the rail projects were

The canals collapse began when a wet spring in 1862 repeatedly overfilled embankment dam reservoirs until the dam above White Haven failed triggering a cascade of failing dams in a flood on June 4 Between 100 or 200 lives were lost in the villages and canal works below the number varying by source The Pennsylvania legislature forbade the rebuilding of the upper canal The canal was used for transportation until the 1940s about a decade after similar canals ceased operations and it was North Americas last fully functioning towpath canal In 1962 most of it was sold to private and public organizations for recreational use

Several segments of the canal were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 including Lehigh Canal Carbon County Section of the Lehigh Canal 79002179 Lehigh Canal Eastern Section Glendon and Abbott Street Industrial Sites 78002437 and Lehigh Canal Allentown to Hopeville Section 79002307 For the Carbon County section also known as Upper Canal Lock 1 to Lower Canal Dam 3 the listing included 30 contributing structures

The eastern section now preserved as a recreationalboating area runs along the Lehigh River from Hopeville to the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers in Easton and includes the Chain Bridge which was NRHPlisted in 1974 The easternsection listing is for a area with three contributing buildings seven contributing sites and 11 contributing structures The AllentowntoHopeville section is a area which includes Greek Revival and Federal architecture in its contributing building and 13 contributing structures

An 8mile 13km segment of the canal towpath has been converted into a multiuse trail from Freemansburg through Bethlehem to Allentown The trail runs along the river and active railroad tracks A section near Jim Thorpe is also accessible to recreational users The final section in Easton is maintained and operated by the National Canal Museum Other short sections are accessible but portions of the canal towpath are worn and unsafe to access

The American Coalition of Life Activists ACLA was a prolife advocacy group that was the subject of controversy for its series of Wantedstyle posters

During a 1995 meeting the group unveiled a wanted poster that listed the names and addresses of a Deadly Dozen abortion providers The poster accused them of crimes against humanity and offered a 5000 reward for the arrest conviction and revocation of license to practice medicine of these physicians The poster was published in Life Advocate magazine A second poster targeted a specific person Dr Robert Crist offered a reward for persuading him to turn from his child killing and included his name address and photo

In 1996 it revealed its Nuremberg Files which included dossiers on abortion providers politicians judges clinic employees and other abortion rights supporters The ACLA claimed that these dossiers could be used for trials for crimes against humanity when the nations laws changed to prohibit abortion Neal Horsley an activist published the information on his website His website greyed the names of those injured and crossed out the names of those killed by antiabortion activists

Planned Parenthood successfully sued the ACLA Although the posters and website did not contain any specific threat the jury awarded 107 million The ACLA appealed the verdict on First Amendment grounds A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals initially overturned the verdict holding that the activities of the ACLA were protected under the First Amendment because they did not directly threaten harm to the plaintiffs and because the ACLAs statements were not communicated privately to the plaintiffs The en banc 9th Circuit reversed the panelhttpnewsfindlawcomhdocsdocsabortionppacla51602opnpdf and held that the ACLA could be held liable in damages because the website made a deliberate threat with the expectation that someone would act on it unprotected by the First Amendment

In the 1860s early settlers came to the area to graze their flocks but the first official records of it began in 1889 when the Great Southern Railway opened and a siding called Buchanan River was opened In 1897 the Government set aside land for subdivision here and in 1903 lots were surveyed and the town of Buchanan gazetted The land agent at Katanning reported considerable interest and a hall school and other facilities had been completed by 1904

However the name clashed with a town in New South Wales now little more than a historic gallery outside Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Region so the town was renamed Barton in 1905 to honour Australias first prime minister 19011903 Sir Edmund Barton However after the construction of the TransAustralian Railway in 1917 another railway station named after Barton in the South Australian stretch of the Nullarbor Plain led to another name change  this time to Piesse after two prominent residents Frederick Henry Piesse and Charles Austin Piesse in December 1918 Five years later the town was changed to its present name  its fourth in 20 years

Payton v New York
Payton v New York 445 US 573 1980 was a United States Supreme Court case concerning warrantless entry into a private home in order to make a felony arrest The Court struck down a New York statute providing for such warrantless entries because the Fourth Amendment draws a firm line at the entrance to the house Absent exigent circumstances that threshold may not be reasonably crossed without a warrant The court however did specify that an arrest warrant as opposed to a search warrant would have sufficed for entry into the suspects residence if there had been reason to believe that the suspect was within the home

Payton and related case law establish that the principle that a person in a home particularly his or her own is entitled Fourth Amendment protections not afforded to persons in automobiles as per Whren v United States or to persons in public as per United States v Watson

Theodore Payton of New York City was suspected of murdering an employee of a gas station in the city Thinking Payton was home the New York City police forcibly entered Paytons home Payton was in fact not home and the police gathered evidence from his home connecting him to the murder of the gas station attendant The police acted under a New York law allowing police to enter a private residence to make a felony arrest without a warrant At his trial Payton was unable to have the evidence thrown out and his conviction was upheld at the appellate level The judge noted that the police entering Paytons house was authorized by the New York law and therefore was permissible

Rudolf Kreitlein
Rudolf Kreitlein 14 November 1919 in Frth  31 July 2012 in Stuttgart was a German international football referee active in the 1960s

Kreitlein is perhaps best known for having refereed the 1966 World Cup quarterfinal match between England and Argentina in which he dismissed Antonio Rattn from the field of play in the 35th minute of the game for a second caution  dissent Rattn initially refused to leave the pitch arguing furiously with Kreitlein even though neither man understood each others native language and the game was held up for several minutes until Rattn reluctantly departed It was also during that game that Jack Charlton was cautioned only to discover the fact the next day from the newspaper report As a result of this incident Kreitlein and Ken Aston developed the idea of yellow cards and red cards to aid onfield communication in football Kreitlein who had never seen the match requested a copy of the game from the Football Association in 2006 Kreitlein retired from international competition in 1967

Kreitlein began his refereeing career at the age of 17 and soon moved to the USA to train referees He subsequently returned to Germany where he tried to become a professional footballer However a serious knee injury ended this aspiration and he concentrated on refereeing instead Kreitleins rise to prominence within the European game was evident prior to the World Cup He had been appointed as one of the German representatives for the 1963 UEFA Youth Championship in England refereeing the final between England and Northern Ireland at Wembley his assistants were the Hungarian orchestral conductor and referee Istvn Zsolt and the Belgian Mark Raemaekers

Kreitlein had been a Bundesliga referee from its inauguration in 1963 but had only refereed 36 matches at national level before being appointed referee in May 1966 to the European Cup Final where he took charge of the game between Real Madrid and Partizan Belgrade in Brussels

Kreitlein worked as a tailor He was married but had no children His wife died in 2008

Beacon Theatres Inc v Westover
Beacon Theatres v Westover 359 US 500 1959 was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States dealing with jury trials in civil matters The court held that where legal and equitable claims are joined in the same action the legal claims must be tried by a jury before the equitable claims can be resolved

The following explanation can be found at the Cornell Law School  Legal Information Institute  United States Constitution site at httpswwwlawcornelleduannconhtmlamdt7frag3userhtml

In Beacon Theatres v Westover the Court held that a district court erred in trying all issues itself in an action in which the plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction barring the defendant from instituting an antitrust action against it and the defendant had filed a counterclaim alleging violation of the antitrust laws and asking for treble damages It did not matter the Court ruled that the equitable claims had been filed first and the law counterclaims involved allegations common to the equitable claims Subsequent jury trial of these issues would probably be precluded by collateral estoppel hence only under the most imperative circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims

Carl Westman
Ernst Carl Westman February 20 1866  January 23 1936 was a Swedish architect and interior designer He was an early adopter of the National Romantic Style but turned later to the neoclassical style of the 1920s 

Carl Westman was born in Uppsala in 1866 He studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in 18851889 and then at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 18891892 in Stockholm In 1893 he married artist Elin Andersson and moved to the United States where he practiced with architect R L Daus in New York City in 18931895 

In 1895 he returned to Stockholm to work for architect Aron Johansson who at that time was the architect working with the new Parliament building 18951904 in Stockholm In 1897 Westman opened his own architect bureau He became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in 1912 and in 1916 he became the chief architect of the Swedish Royal Medical Board 

Carl Westman was one of the foremost advocators in Sweden for a return to the national characteristics in architecture He was one of the first Swedish architects who developed the new Nordic National Romantic Style a style which took the cultural and building precedents and merged them with ideas from the English Arts and Crafts movement to create a very distinct Swedish architecture often in brick and wood 

Carl Westmans Swedish General Medical Association building in Stockholm 19041906 was the first building built in the National Romantic Style with the Rhss Museum in Gothenburg 19101914 and Stockholm Court House 19111915 providing another two prominent examples The Stockholm Courthouse has striking similarities with the medieval Vadstena Castle and provides a dazzling sight in downtown Stockholm though the building proves quite inflexible for its purposes 

Later on Westman worked particularly as a hospital architect gradually adopting the classical style of the 1920s with noted examples being the Beckomberga Hospital 19271935 and the Karolinska Hospital 19351940 which was completed after his death Whereas the psychiatric hospital at Beckomberga was strictly symmetrically planned with massive buildings grouped in a fairly functional pattern the Karolinska hospital strives towards a more functional architecture where the symmetrical design was toned down

Carl Westman was also a parttime interior designer of furniture and utility supplies such as tiled stoves He died in Stockholm in 1936

Tuvia Tenenbom  born 1957 in Bnei Brak Israel is a theater director playwright author journalist essayist and the founding artistic director of the Jewish Theater of New York the only Englishspeaking Jewish theater in New York City Tenenbom was called the founder of a new form of Jewish theatre by the French Le Monde and a New Jew by the Israeli Maariv 
Tenenbom is also an academic having university degrees in mathematics computer science dramatic writing and literature

Tenenbom has written over sixteen plays for The Jewish Theater of New York widely recognized by American and European critics German newspaper Die Zeit described Tenenboms play The Last Virgin as more desperately needed in Germany than suspected The New York Times reviewing Father of the Angels called it irresistibly fascinating and Corriere della Sera reviewing Last Jew In Europe named Tenenbom One of the most iconoclastic and innovative of contemporary dramatists

Tenenbom writes for various newspapers and websites and his political articles cultural criticism and essays have appeared in media outlets including Die Zeit of Germany Corriere della Sera of Italy Yedioth Ahronot of Israel and Fox News Tuvia Tenenbom was also a political columnist for Zeit Online his column appeared every second week  Presently he is a frequent contributor for Die Zeit 

Tenenboms book I Sleep in Hitlers Room published by an imprint of The Jewish Theater of New York is a psychological travelogue through presentday Germany Described by the Israeli paper Haaretz as an alarming account of antiSemitism the book details the wide spread of modern antiSemitism in Europe Tuvia Tenenbom comes off as a Jewish Hunter S Thompson said Spengler of the Asia Times in his review of the book adding To understand Germans one has to learn their language and live with them  or read Tenenboms book Bruce Bawer reviewing it for PJ Media writes Its a book in a category all its own  deeply sobering depressing even in its observations of the darker side of Germany yet at the same time so chatty and engaging and laughoutloud funny that its hard to put down The book also received strong endorsement from the National Review which called it a tremendous book

In December 2012 a German translation of Tenenboms book titled Allein unter Deutschen Alone Among Germans published by Suhrkamp Verlag of Berlin became an instant bestseller on the Spiegel bestseller list Upon publication in Germany book critics differed widely in their opinions of the work Spiegels Wolfgang Hbel and Jakob Augstein were highly critical of the book Die Tageszeitung taz was extremely critical writing that Tenenboms book offered zero insight while Jungle World called the book a gem The GermanJewish journalist Henryk M Broder praised Tenenboms onesidedness comparing him to both Michael Moore and to Sacha Baron Cohens Borat German TV station WDR which Tenenbom accused in his book of assisting an antiSemitic group in Cologne dismissed the book as embarrassing or dumb Deutschlandfunk advised its listeners not to buy the book and encouraged those who had already bought it to bring it back to the bookstore Evelyn Finger of Die Zeit praised the book calling it courageous and describing its content as a Kamikaze ride of discovery into Germanys national character In Germanys Jewish weekly Jdische Allgemeine which is published by the Jewish community of Germany Hannes Stein endorsed Tenenboms book and findings This book contains the bitter nectar of the pure unfiltered truth

Tenenboms book Catch the Jew published by Gefen Publishing recounts the adventures of Tuvia Tenenbom who wanders around Israel of our time calling himself Tobi the German 

In the course of numerous interviews Tuvia extracts information sentiments hidden theories and delusional visions motivating the miscellany of peoples forming the presentday Holy Land The Wall Street Journal hailed the book writing Catch the Jew offers one of the more interesting portraits of Palestinian politics to have appeared in English and concluding that no reader of Catch the Jew can come away having failed to learn many new things about Israelis and Palestinians two peoples we talk about so much but understand so little 

In a starred review Publishers Weekly writes that Tenenboms riveting tale chock full of unbelievable and hilarious encounters is highly engaging and emotional eminently readable brutally honest and likely the most uncensored and eyeopening report readers will see

Orgasm song
Orgasm was the first release by drummer Yoshikis own record label Extasy Records Unusually the bands name X is written on the cover in Japanese as  All 1500 copies sold out and in his biography Yoshiki says an additional pressing of 2500 copies was scheduled but was cancelled as guitarist Jun and bassist Hikaru had left the band

The song is notoriously known for the obvious sexual themes presented within the lyrics Of particular notice is the fact that the track begins with heavy panting and ends with explosions seemingly to emulate sexual climax The title track as well as the selftitled X would later be rerecorded for the bands 1989 second album Blue Blood While Yoshiki is credited with the lyrics and music for both these songs on the single the Blue Blood recordings credit his alias Hitomi Shiratori for their lyrics instead

X has become a signature song of X Japan being performed at nearly all of their concerts Numerous times during a pause in a performance of the track a band member usually vocalist Toshi will yell We are and the audience responds with X before the musicians start the last leg of the song This was used as the title to the 2016 documentary film about the group We Are X

On November 21 1993 SME Records released  a short film based on the manga series X by Clamp and set to X Japans music It features a slideshow of the mangas artwork set to a medley of X Japans Silent Jealousy Kurenai and Endless Rain and a music video for the song X directed by Shigeyuki Hayashi
