Social cognitive theory
Social cognitive theory SCT used in psychology education and communication holds that portions of an individuals knowledge acquisition can be directly related to observing others within the context of social interactions experiences and outside media influences This theory was advanced by Albert Bandura as an extension of his social learning theory The theory states that when people observe a model performing a behavior and the consequences of that behavior they remember the sequence of events and use this information to guide subsequent behaviors Observing a model can also prompt the viewer to engage in behavior they already learned In other words people do not learn new behaviors solely by trying them and either succeeding or failing but rather the survival of humanity is dependent upon the replication of the actions of others Depending on whether people are rewarded or punished for their behavior and the outcome of the behavior the observer may choose to replicate behavior modeled Media provides models for a vast array of people in many different environmental settings

The conceptual roots for social cognitive theory come from Edwin B Holt and Harold Chapman Browns 1931 book theorizing that all animal action is based on fulfilling the psychological needs of feeling emotion and desire The most notable component of this theory is that it predicted a person cannot learn to imitate until they are imitated

In 1941 Neal E Miller and John Dollard presented their book with a revision of Holts social learning and imitation theory They argued four factors contribute to learning drives cues responses and rewards One driver is social motivation which includes imitativeness the process of matching an act to an appropriate cue of where and when to perform the act A behavior is imitated depending on whether the model receives a positive or negative response consequences Miller and Dollard argued that if one were motivated to learn a particular behavior then that particular behavior would be learned through clear observations By imitating these observed actions the individual observer would solidify that learned action and would be rewarded with positive reinforcement

The proposition of social learning was expanded upon and theorized by Canadian psychologist Albert Bandura Bandura along with his students and colleagues conducted a series of studies known as the Bobo doll experiment in 1961 and 1963 to find out why and when children display aggressive behaviors These studies demonstrated the value of modeling for acquiring novel behaviors These studies helped Bandura publish his seminal article and book in 1977 that expanded on the idea of how behavior is acquired and thus built from Miller and Dollards research In Banduras 1977 article he claimed that Social Learning Theory shows a direct correlation between a persons perceived selfefficacy and behavioral change Selfefficacy comes from four sources performance accomplishments vicarious experience verbal persuasion and physiological states

In 1986 Bandura published his second book which expanded and renamed his original theory He called the new theory social cognitive theory Bandura changed the name to emphasize the major role cognition plays in encoding and performing behaviors In this book Bandura argued that human behavior is caused by personal behavioral and environmental influences

In 2001 Bandura brought SCT to mass communication in his journal article that stated the theory could be used to analyze how symbolic communication influences human thought affect and action The theory shows how new behavior diffuses through society by psychosocial factors governing acquisition and adoption of the behavior

In 2011 Bandura published a book chapter  The Social and Policy Impact of Social Cognitive Theoryto extend SCTS application in health promotion and urgent global issues which provides insight into addressing global problems through a macro social lens aiming at improving equality of individuals lives under the umbrellas of SCT

SCT has been applied to many areas of human functioning such as career choice and organizational behavior as well as in understanding classroom motivation learning and achievement

Social Cognitive Theory originated in psychology but based on an unofficial November 2013 Google Scholar search only 2 percent of articles published on SCT are in the pure psychology field About 20 percent of articles are from Education and 16 percent from Business The majority of publications using SCT 56 percent come from the field of Applied Health Psychology The majority of current research in Health Psychology focuses on testing SCT in behavioral change campaigns as opposed to expanding on the theory Campaign topics include increasing fruit and vegetable intake increasing physical activity HIV education and breastfeeding

Born in 1925 Bandura is still influencing the world with expansions of SCT His recent work published May 2011 focuses on how SCT impacts areas of both health and population in relation to climate change He proposes that these problems could be solved through television serial dramas that show models similar to viewers performing the desired behavior On health Bandura writes that currently there is little incentive for doctors to write prescriptions for healthy behavior but he believes the cost of fixing health problems start to outweigh the benefits of being healthy Bandura argues that we are on the cusp of moving from a disease model focusing on people with problems to a health model focusing on people being healthy and SCT is the theory that should be used to further a healthy society Specifically on Population Bandura states that population growth is a global crisis because of its correlation with depletion and degradation of our planets resources Bandura argues that SCT should be used to increase birth control use reduce gender inequality through education and to model environmental conservation to improve the state of the planet

Social cognitive theory is a learning theory based on the idea that people learn by observing others These learned behaviors can be central to ones personality While social psychologists agree that the environment one grows up in contributes to behavior the individual person and therefore cognition is just as important People learn by observing others with the environment behavior and cognition acting as primary factors that influence development in a reciprocal triadic relationship Each behavior witnessed can change a persons way of thinking cognition Similarly the environment one is raised in may influence later behaviors For example a caregivers mindset also cognition determines the environment in which their children are raised

The core concepts of this theory are explained by Bandura through a schematization of triadic reciprocal causation The schema shows how the reproduction of an observed behavior is influenced by the interaction of the following three determinants 

It is important to note that learning can occur without a change in behavior According to JE Ormrods general principles of social learning while a visible change in behavior is the most common proof of learning it is not absolutely necessary Social learning theorists believe that because people can learn through observation alone their learning may not necessarily be shown in their performance These are interdependent on each other and its influence can be directly linked with individual or group psychological behavior According to Alex Stajkovic and Fred Luthans it is critically important to recognize that the relative influences exerted by one two or three interacting factors on motivated behavior will vary depending on different activities different individuals and different circumstances

Social cognitive theory is proposed in an agentic perspective which suggests that instead of being just shaped by environments or inner forces individuals are selfdeveloping selfregulating selfreflecting and proactive Specifically human agency operates within three modes

Human agency has four core properties


Evolving over time human beings are featured with advanced neural systems which enable individuals to acquire knowledge and skills by both direct and symbolic terms Four primary capabilities are addressed as important foundations of social cognitive theory symbolizing capability selfregulation capability selfreflective capability and vicarious capability


Social cognitive theory revolves around the process of knowledge acquisition or learning directly correlated to the observation of models The models can be those of an interpersonal imitation or media sources Effective modeling teaches general rules and strategies for dealing with different situations

To illustrate that people learn from watching others Albert Bandura and his colleagues constructed a series of experiments using a Bobo doll In the first experiment children were exposed to either an aggressive or nonaggressive model of either the same sex or opposite sex as the child There was also a control group The aggressive models played with the Bobo doll in an aggressive manner while the nonaggressive models played with other toys They found that children who were exposed to the aggressive models performed more aggressive actions toward the Bobo doll afterward and that boys were more likely to do so than girls

Following that study Albert Bandura tested whether the same was true for models presented through media by constructing an experiment he called Bobo Doll Behavior A Study of Aggression In this experiment Bandura exposed a group of children to a video featuring violent and aggressive actions After the video he then placed the children in a room with a Bobo doll to see how they behaved with it Through this experiment Bandura discovered that children who had watched the violent video subjected the dolls to more aggressive and violent behavior while children not exposed to the video did not This experiment displays the social cognitive theory because it depicts how people reenact behaviors they see in the media In this case the children in this experiment reenacted the model of violence they directly learned from the video

Observations should include 

Modeling does not limit to only live demonstrations but also verbal and written behaviour can act as indirect forms of modeling Modeling not only allows students to learn behaviour that they should repeat but also to inhibit certain behaviours For instance if a teacher glares at one student who is talking out of turn other students may suppress this behavior to avoid a similar reaction Teachers model both material objectives and underlying curriculum of virtuous living Teachers should also be dedicated to the building of high selfefficacy levels in their students by recognizing their accomplishments

To learn a particular behavior people must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat that behavior The observer does not expect the actual rewards or punishments incurred by the model but anticipates similar outcomes when imitating the behavior called outcome expectancies which is why modeling impacts cognition and behavior These expectancies are heavily influenced by the environment that the observer grows up in for example the expected consequences for a DUI in the United States of America are a fine with possible jail time whereas the same charge in another country might lead to the infliction of the death penalty

For example in the case of a student the instructions the teacher provides help students see what outcome a particular behaviour leads to It is the duty of the teacher to teach a student that when a behaviour is successfully learned the outcomes are meaningful and valuable to the students

Social cognitive theory posits that learning most likely occurs if there is a close identification between the observer and the model and if the observer also has a good deal of selfefficacy Selfefficacy is the extent to which an individual believes that they can master a particular skill Selfefficacy beliefs function as an important set of proximal determinants of human motivation affect and actionwhich operate on action through motivational cognitive and affective intervening processes

According to Bandura selfefficacy is the belief in ones capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations Bandura and other researchers have found an individuals selfefficacy plays a major role in how goals tasks and challenges are approached Individuals with high selfefficacy are more likely to believe they can master challenging problems and they can recover quickly from setbacks and disappointments Individuals with low selfefficacy tend to be less confident and dont believe they can perform well which leads them to avoid challenging tasks Therefore selfefficacy plays a central role in behavior performance Observers who have high level of selfefficacy are more likely to adopt observational learning behaviors

Selfefficacy can be developed or increased by 

For example students become more effortful active pay attention highly motivated and better learners when they perceive that they have mastered a particular task It is the duty of the teacher to allow student to perceive in their efficacy by providing feedback to understand their level of proficiency Teachers should ensure that the students have the knowledge and strategies they need to complete the tasks

Selfefficacy has also been used to predict behavior in various health related situations such as weight loss quitting smoking and recovery from heart attack In relation to exercise science selfefficacy has produced some of the most consistent results revealing an increase in participation in exercise

Identification allows the observer to feel a onetoone similarity with the model and can thus lead to a higher chance of the observer following through with the modeled action People are more likely to follow behaviors modeled by someone with whom they can identify with The more commonalities or emotional attachments perceived between the observer and the model the more likely the observer learns and reenact the modeled behavior

Social cognitive theory is often applied as a theoretical framework of studies pertained to media representation regarding race gender age and beyond Social cognitive theory suggested heavily repeated images presented in mass media can be potentially processed and encoded by the viewers Bandura 2011 Media content analytic studies examine the substratum of media messages that viewers are exposed to which could provide an opportunity to uncover the social values attached to these media representations Although media contents studies cannot directly test the cognitive process findings can offer an avenue to predict potential media effects from modeling certain contents which provides evidence and guidelines for designing subsequent empirical work

Social cognitive theory is pervasively employed in studies examining attitude or behavior changes triggered by the mass media As Bandura suggested people can learn how to perform behaviors through media modeling SCT has been widely applied in media studies pertained to sports health education and beyond For instance Hardin and Greer in 2009 examined the gendertyping of sports within the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory suggesting that sports media consumption and genderrole socialization significantly related with gender perception of sports in American college students

In health communication social cognitive theory has been applied in research related to smoking quit HIV prevention safe sex behaviors and so on For example Martino Collins Kanouse Elliott and Berry in 2005 examined the relationship between the exposure to televisions sexual content and adolescents sexual behavior through the lens of social cognitive theory confirming the significant relationship between the two variables among white and African American groups however no significant correlation was found between the two variables in the ethic group of Hispanics indicating that peer norm could possibly serve as a mediator of the two examined variables

Millers 2005 study found that choosing the proper gender age and ethnicity for models ensured the success of an AIDS campaign to inner city teenagers This occurred because participants could identify with a recognizable peer have a greater sense of selfefficacy and then imitate the actions to learn the proper preventions and actions
A study by Azza Ahmed in 2009 looked to see if there would be an increase in breastfeeding by mothers of preterm infants when exposed to a breastfeeding educational program guided by SCT Sixty mothers were randomly assigned to either participate in the program or they were given routine care The program consisted of SCT strategies that touched on all three SCT determinants personal  showing models performing breastfeeding correctly to improve selfefficacy behavioral weekly checkins for three months reinforced participants skills environmental  mothers were given an observational checklist to make sure they successfully completed the behavior The author found that mothers exposed to the program showed significant improvement in their breastfeeding skills were more likely to exclusively breastfeed and had fewer problems then the mothers who were not exposed to the educational program

Social cognitive theory emphasizes a large difference between an individuals ability to be morally competent and morally performing Moral competence involves having the ability to perform a moral behavior whereas moral performance indicates actually following ones idea of moral behavior in a specific situation Moral competencies include

As far as an individuals development is concerned moral competence is the growth of cognitivesensory processes simply put being aware of what is considered right and wrong By comparison moral performance is influenced by the possible rewards and incentives to act a certain way For example a persons moral competence might tell them that stealing is wrong and frowned upon by society however if the reward for stealing is a substantial sum their moral performance might indicate a different line of thought Therein lies the core of social cognitive theory

For the most part social cognitive theory remains the same for various cultures Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures as crimes like murder theft and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society there is not much room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts Our actions in reallife scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating our morals is significant enough and nothing else

In series TV programming according to social cognitive theory the awarded behaviors of liked characters are supposed to be followed by viewers while punished behaviors are supposed to be avoided by media consumers However in most cases protagonists in TV shows are less likely to experience the longterm suffering and negative consequences caused by their risky behaviors which could potentially undermine the punishments conveyed by the media leading to a modeling of the risky behaviors Nabi and Clark conducted experiments about individuals attitudes and intentions consuming various portrayals of onenight stand sex unsafe and risky sexual behavior finding that individuals who had not previously experience one night stand sex consuming media portrayals of this behavior could significantly increase their expectations of having an one night stand sex in the future although negative outcomes were represented in TV shows

4533
4533 is a composition by American rock band LCD Soundsystem released digitally on October 17 2006 Commissioned by Nike New Yorkbased creative lifestyle marketing and public relations agency Cornerstone helped the musical efforts and coordinated the track The original work was initially available exclusively at Nike Music Store on iTunes A fulllength album rerelease with three bonus tracks was issued by DFA Records on CD and vinyl on November 12 2007 An eight track remix CD entitled  was released September 2009 4533 was rereleased as a limited edition whitelabel vinyl on May 26 2015

The composition was recorded between July and September 2006 at DFA Studios in New York City The publicity for 4533 described it as being designed to accompany jogging workouts to reward and push at good intervals of a run An early statement detailed that the composition had been refined after several runs on the treadmill James Murphy later admitted that this was entirely a lie on his part and that he does not actually jog He stated that he wanted to make a longform record like E2E4 by Manuel Gttsching and used the opportunity provided by Nike to do so The artwork of 4533 also resembles that of Gttschings work

Parts of 4533 were later used on the album Sound of Silver in particular the track Someone Great which appears on 4533 as an instrumental section later distinguished as track 3 The complete track was also released for registered Nike users in late March 2007 as a gift of appreciation when Nike logged its 10 millionth mile The composition was available to be sold by Nike via iTunes for six months

Although the composition is titled 4533 a reference to the two most common speeds in RPM of vinyl records the actual length is slightly longer

For the last series of concerts at Terminal 5 and Madison Square Garden LCD Soundsystem performed 4533 in full during the second set Part 3 was saved until the performance of Someone Great In the place of Part 3 LCD Soundsystem performed Sound of Silver

DFA Records announced that 4533 would be rereleased on November 12 2007 It was made available on CD and vinyl through DFA and EMI The rerelease featured three bonus tracks Freak OutStarry Eyes James Murphy and Eric Brouceks dub remix of North American Scum and Hippie Priest Bumout all of which were Bsides from European versions of Sound of Silver singles These three tracks would also be made available together separately on the Confuse the Marketplace EP released on December 11 2007

4533 received critical acclaim On the review aggregator website Metacritic which assigns a weighted average out of 100 points the album received an average critic score of 86 based on 25 reviews indicating universal acclaim Manuel Gttsching was however critical of the composition despite it being inspired by his own work stating Musically there is nothing related to E2E4  its just a megamix of his work

Type 89 IGo medium tank
The was a medium tank used by the Imperial Japanese Army from 1932 to 1942 in combat operations of the Second SinoJapanese War at Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union and in the Second World War The Type 89B model was the worlds first massproduced diesel engine tank The tank was armed with a shortbarrel 57 mm cannon for knocking out pillboxes and masonry fortifications and proved effective in campaigns in Manchuria and China as the Chinese National Revolutionary Army had only three tank battalions to oppose them which consisted primarily of Vickers export models German Panzer Is and Italian CV33 tankettes The Type 89 was a 1920s design medium tank built to support the infantry and thus lacked the armor or armament of 1940s generation Allied armor it was regarded as obsolete by the time of the 1939 battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union The code designation IGo comes from the katakana letter  for first and the kanji  for number The designation is also transliterated ChiRo and sometimes YiGo
The Type 89 evolved from Japans first domestic tank project initiated by the Imperial Japanese Armys Osaka Technical Arsenal in 1925 The original plan was for two types of tanks to be created A light tank at 10ton based on the French Renault FT tank and a 20ton design modeled after the Vickers Medium tank By February 1927 the Type 87 ChiI medium tank was ready for trials However it was 20ton and underpowered The weight of the initial prototype and its low speed did not impress the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and a new requirement was issued for a lighter tank with a nominal weight The new design was modeled after the Vickers Medium C which had been bought by the Japanese Army in March 1927

By April 1928 the new light tank design was finished The prototype of the was completed in 1929 and designated as the Type 89 Later the Type 89 was reclassified as a medium tank because the weight increased to over 10 tons due to several improvements As the armys Sagami Arsenal lacked the capacity for mass production a contract was awarded to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries which built a new tank factory to specifically produce this model Production of the Type 89 began in 1931 and it soon became the main battle tank of the Japanese Army

Although the Type 89 was well regarded by the army there were several small problems to be rectified notably a gap under the mantlet on early models that allowed rifle fire to enter the turret Work continued on improving the Type 89 after the production started and as a result variants were developed

The Type 89 required a crew of four commandergunner loader driver and hull gunner

The design of the Type 89 was relatively conventional with a forwardmounted gun turret carrying the main armament a Type 90 57 mm gun that was complemented by two Type 91 65 mm machine guns One was located in the front hull and the other placed in a turret ball mount pointed towards the rear a practice followed with most Japanese tanks The Type 90 57mm tank gun had a barrel length of L149 el angle of fire of 15 to 20 degrees AZ angle of fire of 20 degrees muzzle velocity of  and could penetrate of 20mm of armor at 500 m 08in550yd

Rather than using soft iron armor as on the earlier ChiI the designers chose to use steel plate armor developed by the Nihon Seikosho Company JSW The type of armor was referred to as Niseko steel an abbreviation of Nihonseikosho

The Type 89 was driven through the rear drive sprocket and featured nine bogies mounted in pairs on each side with the forward bogie on an independent suspension Five smaller return wheels were mounted along a steel girder The Type A could only communicate with signal flags Some vehicles were provided with two searchlights for night operations Later the Type 94 Mk 4 Hei 1934 model radio communication device with range of 06 miles and weight of 198lb linked with a radio antenna of in a reverse L shape was installed


The Type 89 served with Japanese infantry divisions and first saw combat use during the First Battle of Shanghai in 1932 The shortbarreled 57mm gun was effective at destroying machine gun nests and its armor although thin was enough to stop small arms fire The relatively low speed of was not an issue in these types of operations

The following year the Japanese Army formed its first independent armor force by creating three regiments armed with the Type 89 each consisting of two companies with ten tanks each Three more regiments were formed in 1934 It was deployed for infantry support operations in the Second SinoJapanese War and in various campaigns throughout China after 1937 After the outbreak of war with China the peacetime budgetary limitations were removed and the more capable and expensive Mitsubishi ChiHa model was accepted as the new Type 97 medium tank by the army to replace the Type 89 Type 89s were the main medium tank of the Japanese military through 1937

On the evening of 2 July 1939 during the battle of Khalkhin Gol the Japanese Armys 1st Tank Corps commanded by Lt General Yasuoka Masaomi launched an offensive against the Soviet Unions 11th Tank and 7th Armored brigades The 1st Tank Corps consisted of the 3rd Tank Regiment and 4th Tank Regiment of which the 3rd regiment consisted of 26 Type 89s four Type 97 medium tanks seven Type 94 tankettes and four Type 97 tankettes and the 4th regiment contained 35 Type 95s eight Type 89s and three Type 94 tankettes respectively In this battle the Type 97 medium tank was a newly fielded machine and was primarily reserved for home units as well as transitioning into Japanese Army forces stationed in China Manchuria

The 3rd Tank Regiment had after charging through Soviet artillery barrages successfully overrun the Soviet motorized infantry and taken the high ground which had been quickly abandoned by the Soviets However by 2100 hours Soviet counter battery fire had begun pounding the newly taken position and the 3rd Tank repositioned themselves behind the objective

The 4th Tank Regiment which had become separated from the 3rd Tank Regiment advanced upon an objective under the cover of a thunderstorm that masked their movements but exposed the Soviet positions The 4th Tank Regiment continued to advance when suddenly a shift in the lightning flashes illuminated the advancing Japanese tanks whereupon the Soviets immediately opened fire with antitank guns heavy machine guns and artillery However the range was so close that the Soviet artillery could not depress their guns far enough and the 4th Tank Regiment was ordered to charge at about 0020 hours 1220 AM Soviet shells passed wildly over the charging tanks as they penetrated over a thousand yards into the Soviet lines Now isolated and deep within the Soviet lines the 4th Tank Regiment moved several thousands yards where they met up with Japanese infantry

The 4th Tank Regiment had expended 1100 37mm and 129 57mm tank shells during the fight as well as about 16000 machine gun rounds Of the approximate 73 light and medium Japanese tanks from both regiments committed to the offensive 13 were damaged beyond repair by Soviet gunfire about 14 others were repaired after major overhauls and 17 tanks were repaired in the field

Soviet forces concluded that the 1st Tank Corps had penetrated the defenses of their 9th Armored Brigade and 149th Infantry Regiment and had reached Soviet artillery positions

By 1942 the Type 89 was gradually being withdrawn from frontline combat service but many units saw action in the Battle of the Philippines Battle of Malaya and Burma campaign and continued to be used in China They were also often used in static defense positions in the Japaneseoccupied islands of the Netherlands East Indies and in the South Pacific Mandate but with their weak armor and low muzzle velocity main gun they were a poor match for the American M4 Sherman

During the early stages of the First Indochina War France set up an ad hoc unit of French and Japanese armour called the Commando Blind du Cambodge from tanks left over from the Japanese invasion of French Indochina This unit included one Type 89B tank

Atalanti Island
Atalanti  or Atalantonisi  or Talandonsi  is a small uninhabited island in the North Euboean Gulf about 600 m off the coast near the town Atalanti Phthiotis Greece There are several small islets next to Atalanti island including the islet of Agios Nikolaos

Anciently the island was known as Atalanta or Atalante  It was noted by ancient geographers and historians as a small island off Locris in the Opuntian Gulf said to have been torn asunder from the mainland by an earthquake In the first year of the Peloponnesian War this previously uninhabited island was fortified by the Athenians to prevent Locrian pirates attacking Euboea In the sixth year of the war a part of the Athenian works was destroyed by the sea with half the ships on the beach destroyed Thucydides reports that following an earthquake the sea receded from the shore before returning in a huge wave Citing similar events at Peparethus and Orobiae he suggests that earthquakes and such sea events are linkedwe now know that such tsunami are in fact caused by earthquakes In 421BCE the Peace of Nicias returned Atalanta to Sparta Aside from Thucydides the island is noted by Strabo Diodorus Pausanias Livy Pliny the Elder Seneca and Stephanus of Byzantium

Soul Enterprise
The Soul Enterprise is often described as more of a fraternity than a band per se It was founded in 1990 by vocalist Bob Manning from the USA with other American musicians based in Sweden such as JairRohm Parker Wells and Bill Bryant It featured the sounds of oldschool Soul music with a blend of jazz improvisation 

In the beginning years the groups founding members were busy freelancing for other acts besides the Soul Enterprise such as Dr Alban and Jennifer Brown A period of instability followed with many different substitute musicians playing in the band The group went through major reforms and a complete change of members followed under the leadership of guitarist Zak Keith in 1992 The new lineup of firstcall musicians included some of Stockholms best many considered to be worldclass musicians such as Morgan gren drums Anders Johnsson bass Micke Wennergrund drums Lasse Pollack keyboards Magnus Lindgren Saxophone Micke Srensen trumpet Mia Gejrot Anna SandbergHll and Tonja Hedtjrn voc Magnus Lindgren went on to play with Herbie Hancock at age 18 Micke Srensen went on to work with former Supremes member Mary Wilson Lasse Pollack toured with Glenn Hughes in Japan 

The Soul Enterprise was voted best Soul band of Scandinavia by Fasching Jazz Club in 1998 Dagens Nyheter a major Swedish newspaper credited Bob Manning and the Soul Enterprise as a major influence in keeping Soul music alive in Scandinavia Its musicians work as sessionists and have appeared on numerous records together and individually

Alkaline tide
Alkaline tide refers to a condition normally encountered after eating a meal where during the production of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells in the stomach the parietal cells secrete bicarbonate ions across their basolateral membranes and into the blood causing a temporary increase in pH

During hydrochloric acid secretion in the stomach the gastric parietal cells extract chloride anions carbon dioxide water and sodium cations from the blood plasma and in turn release bicarbonate back into the plasma after forming it from carbon dioxide and water constituents This is to maintain the plasmas electrical balance as the chloride anions have been extracted The bicarbonate content causes the venous blood leaving the stomach to be more alkaline than the arterial blood delivered to it

The alkaline tide is neutralised by a secretion of Hinto the blood during HCO secretion in the pancreas

Postprandial ie after a meal alkaline tide lasts until the acids in food absorbed in the small intestine reunite with the bicarbonate that was produced when the food was in the stomach Thus alkaline tide is selflimited and normally lasts less than two hours

Postprandial alkaline tide has also been shown to be a causative agent of calcium oxalate urinary stones in cats and potentially in other species

A more pronounced alkaline tide results from vomiting which stimulates hyperactivity of gastric parietal cells to replace lost stomach acid Thus protracted vomiting can result in metabolic alkalosis

<doc id="7716173" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716173" title="NMR tube">
NMR tube
An NMR tube is a thin glass walled tube used to contain samples in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Typically NMR tubes come in 5mm diameters but 10mm and 3mm samples are known It is important that the tubes are uniformly thick and wellbalanced to ensure that NMR tube spins at a regular rate ie they do not wobble usually about 20Hz in the NMR spectrometer

NMR tubes are typically made of borosilicate glass They are available in seven and eight inch lengths a 5mm tube outer diameter is most common but 3mm and 10mm outer diameters are available as well Where boron NMR is desired quartz NMR tubes containing low concentrations of boron as opposed to borosilicate glass are available Specialized closures such as J Young valves and screwcap closures are available aside from more common polyethylene caps

Two common specifications for NMR tubes are concentricity and camber Concentricity refers to the variation in the radial centers measured at the inner and outer walls Camber refers to the straightness of the tube Poor values for either may cause poorer quality spectra by reducing the homogeneity of the sample In particular an NMR tube which has poor camber may wobble when rotated giving rise to spinning side bands With modern manufacturing techniques even cheap tubes give good spectra for routine applications

Usually only a small sample is dissolved in an appropriate solvent For H NMR experiments this will usually be a deuterated solvent such as CDCl Sufficient solvent should be used in order to fill the tube by 45cm depending on the spectrometer Protein NMR is usually performed in a 90 HO or buffer10 DO mixture

The sample may be sonicated or agitated to aid dissolution and solids are removed via filtering through a plug of celite in a Pasteur pipette directly into the NMR tube

The NMR tube is then usually sealed with a polyethylene cap but can be flame sealed or sealed with a Teflon Schlenk tap or even a very small rubber septum Parafilm may be wrapped around the cap to reduce solvent evaporation

A Shigemi tube is a microscale NMR tube used with an ordinarysize NMR tube Shigemi tubes may be appropriate for protein NMR experiments where only a smaller sample is available A corresponding smaller solvent volume is desired to maintain a higher sample concentration The reduced sample depth is compensated for by solid glass on the NMR tube beneath the level of sample which varies for the make of spectrometer Once air bubbles have been expelled the plunger is secured to the tube proper by parafilm Ideally the tubes are matched with the deuterated solvent used to have better spectrum resolution

NMR tubes are hard to clean because of their small bore They are cleaned best before the sample has dried

Cleaning is performed usually by rinsing with the same nondeuterated solvent used to dissolve the initial sample Dichloromethane or acetone are good choices because dichloromethane is similar in polarity to chloroform a common NMR solvent while acetone dissolves many organic compounds Sonication and scrubbing with a pipe cleaner may be helpful in removing traces of solid contaminants If necessary the tube may be filled with an oxidizing solution of aqua regia or piranha solution HOHSO Care should be taken with these solutions as they can unexpectedly and violently erupt from the NMR tube due to pressure buildup aque regia or explosion piranha Chromic acid solutions are never used due to traces of paramagnetic chromium left behind on the tubes causing interference with NMR experiments

When the NMR tube is determined to be clean it is triplerinsed with distilled water acetone and left to airdry or dry in an oven at hightemperature It is best not to exceed 60C At higher temperatures slight tube distortion can occur which will affect tube camber If NMR tubes are washed a final rinse is recommended with a solvent that easily evaporates at 60C and that has no residue

A better alternative to the use of potentially hazardous oxidizers is an NMR tube cleaner right It is an apparatus which uses a vacuum to flush solvent andor a detergent solution through the entire length of the NMR tube

In this apparatus the NMR tube 1 with the cap 3 fixed to the base of the NMR tube is placed upside down on the apparatus The NMR tube fits over an inner tube 5 linked to the solvent reservoir 6 The NMR cap rests on the outer tube of the apparatus 4 A vacuum is applied usually via a water aspirator via the vacuum inlet The NMR tube cap forms a vacuum seal Solvent 7 is drawn from the solvent reservoir 6 and is forced to the base of the NMR tube and flushes the NMR tube out 9 with solvent cleaning it Note to complete the vacuum a flask is attached to the NMR tube cleaning apparatus

This sort of apparatus is commercially available though it is costly and easy to destroy by shattering or breaking off the cleaning tube Equivalent designs may be assembled from ordinary labware as well

Day of the Tiles
The Day of the Tiles  was an event that took place in the French town of Grenoble on 7 June in 1788 It was one of the first disturbances which preceded the French Revolution and is credited by a few historians as its start

Grenoble was the scene of popular unrest due to financial hardship from the economic crises The causes of the French Revolution affected all of France but matters came to a head first in Grenoble

Unrest in the parlementary town was sparked by the attempts of Cardinal tienne Charles de Lomnie de Brienne the Archbishop of Toulouse and ControllerGeneral of Louis XVI to abolish the Parlements to work around their refusal to enact a new tax to deal with Frances unmanageable public debt

Tensions that had been rising in urban populations due to poor harvests and the high cost of bread were exacerbated by the refusal of the privileged classes  the Church and the aristocracy who insisted on retaining the right to collect feudal and seignorial royalties from their peasants and landholders  to relinquish any of their fiscal privileges This blocked the reforms of the kings minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne and the Assembly of Notables of January 1787 Added to this Brienne appointed as the kings ControllerGeneral of Finance on 8 April 1787 was widely regarded as being a manager without experience or imagination

Shortly before 7 June 1788 in a large meeting at Grenoble those who attended the meeting decided to call together the old Estates of the province of Dauphin The government responded by sending troops to the area to put down the movement

At roughly 10 in the morning of Saturday 7 June merchants closed down their shops as groups of 300 to 400 men and women formed armed with stones sticks axes bars They rushed to the city gates to prevent the departure of judges who took part in the Grenoble meeting Some rioters attempted to cross the Isre but faced a picket of 50 soldiers at the St Lawrence bridge while others headed to the Rue Neuve
The cathedrals bells were seized by French peasants at noon The crowd swiftly grew as the bells provoked the influx of neighbouring peasants to creep in the city climbing the walls using boats on the Isere and for some pushing open the city gates

Other insurgents boarded the ramparts and rushed to the hotel Lhtel de la Premire prsidence the Duke of ClermontTonnerre was staying in at the time The Duke had two elite regiments in Grenoble the Regiment of the Royal Navy Rgiment RoyalLaMarine whose colonel was Marquis dAmbert and the regiment of Austrasia Rgiment dAustrasie which was commanded by Colonel Count Chabord The Royal Navy was the first to respond to the growing crowds and was given the order to quell the rioting without the use of arms However as the mob stormed the hotel entrance the situation escalated Soldiers sent to quell the disturbances forced the townspeople off the streets Some sources say that the soldiers were sent to disperse parliamentarians who were attempting to assemble a parliament During an attack Royal Navy soldiers injured a 75yearold man with a bayonet At the sight of blood the people became angry and started to tear up the streets Townspeople climbed onto the roofs of buildings around the Jesuit College to hurl down a rain of rooftiles on the soldiers in the streets below hence the episodes name Many soldiers took refuge in a building to shoot through the windows while the crowd continued to rush inside and ravage everything

A noncommissioned officer of the Royal Navy commanding a patrol of four soldiers gave the order to open fire into the mob One civilian was killed and a boy of 12 wounded To the east of the city the Royal Navy soldiers were forced to open fire in order to protect the citys arsenal fearing that the rioters would seize the weapons and ammunition Meanwhile Colonel Count Chabord began deploying the regiment of Austrasia to aid and relieve the Royal Navy soldiers

Three of the citys four consults gathered at the City Hall and attempted to reason with the crowd However their words were silenced amidst the clamour of the mob Through great difficulty the consults made their way through the crowds and eventually took refuge with the officers of the local garrison Later that evening the Duke of ClermontTonnerre withdrew his troops from the streets and hotel to prevent further violence from escalating the situation The Duke managed to narrowly escape the hotel before the crowd completely looted the inside With control of the hotel lost the Royal Navy troops were ordered to return to their quarters

At six a crowd estimated at ten thousand people shouting Long live the parliament forced the judges to return to the Palace of the Parliament of Dauphin Palais du Parlement du Dauphin by flooding them with flowers Throughout the night carillons sounded triumphantly a large bonfire crackled on SaintAndr square surrounded by a crowd that danced and sang Long live forever our parliament May God preserve the King and the devil take Brienne and Lamoignon 

On 10 June the local commander attempted to appease the spirits of the crowd with no success Under the orders of exile pronounced against them by the King the parliamentarians were forced to flee from Grenoble in the morning of 12 June It wasnt until the 14th of July that order was fully restored in the city by Marshal Vaux who replaced the Duke of ClermontTonnerre

The commander of the troops found the situation so alarming that he agreed to allow the meeting of the Estates to proceed but not in the capital A meeting was therefore arranged for the 21 July 1788 at the nearby village of Vizille This meeting became known as the Assembly of Vizille

In all six outbreaks of rioting have been identified in the city on 7 June

The event was commemorated by Alexandre Debelles The Day of the Tiles 13 July 1788 painted in 1889 He painted it a century after the event and got the date wrong but it undoubtedly attempts to depict the events described by the title

The meeting of the three Estates which had been agreed to took place at Vizille on 21 July Several hundred people assembled representing the three Estates the nobility the clergy and the middle class the bourgeoisie who were granted double representation The meeting was led by a moderate reformist lawyer Jean Joseph Mounier and passed resolutions

These demands were accepted by the King Brienne left office during August 1788 but before doing so issued a decree convoking the EstatesGeneral for 1 May 1789 It is not clear whether this decree was prompted by the demands from the Assembly of Vizille or the Day of the Tiles because at least one source puts the date of the decree at 7 July 1788 after the Day of the Tiles but two weeks before the Assembly of Vizille

Since 1984 the Chteau de Vizille houses the Muse de la Rvolution franaise

Some historians such as Jonathan Sperber have used the Day of the Tiles to demonstrate the worsening situation in France in the buildup to the French Revolution of 1789 Others have even credited it with being the beginning of the revolution itself The events as related by R M Johnston provide an apparently clear link between the Day of the Tiles the Assembly of Vizille and the start of the revolution proper

Development of the Type 4 ChiTo began in 1943 as an intended successor to the Type 97Kai Shinhoto ChiHa The Army Technical Bureau had been working on the Type 4 ChiTo as the counter to the M4 Sherman but there were problems and delays in the program As a result a stopgap tank was required The Type 3 ChiNu medium tank was developed to cope with the M4 Sherman Finally the first prototype Type 4 ChiTo was delivered in 1944 Similar in appearance but significantly larger than the Type 97 it was the most advanced Japanese tank to reach the production stage

Intended Type 4 ChiTo output was 25 tanks per month with 20 to be made at Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 5 to be produced at Kobe Seikosho Late war shortageinduced delays caused by the severing of supply lines with conquered territories and US strategic bombing of the Japanese mainland resulted in a total of six chassis being built According to The National Institute for Defense Studies Ministry of Defense Military Administration of Munitions Mobilization Production Chart of January to April of 1945 the plan was to produce a total of 6 Type 4 ChiTo tanks in the first three months of 1945 Two Type 4 ChiTo tanks are known to have been completed in 1945 and neither saw combat

Another 105mm SP gun planned was the KaTo or KaTo Sha 105mm SP AT Gun KaTos development was ordered in 1943 The engine placement was forward while the gun placement was in the rear section of the hull The open top superstructure was based on the Type 5 NaTo Two main guns for the KaTo were completed in 1945 According to several sources the KaTo hull was based on the Type 4 ChiTo which needed to be extended in length to accommodate the main gun An extra road wheel was added to each side of the chassis However according to another source the incomplete KaTo hull was based on the Type 5 ChiRi medium tank

Jean Mercier
Jean Mercier 19011971 a Frenchman was known as the father of the bladdertype hydraulic accumulator Mercier fled France for the United States during the Nazi invasion eventually settling in New York City After meeting Edward M Greer in 1940 the two founded Greer Hydraulics in 1942 to produce aircraft hydraulic components

In 1943 Jean Mercier recognized an opportunity for his bladder type accumulators in Hamilton Standards hydromatic propellers They needed a device that would fit inside the dome of their propeller and have the ability to store sufficient hydraulic fluid to feather the propeller on an engine failure that might be experienced in combat It also had to be able to function at temperatures from 40F to 180F There was a single insurmountable problemweight which was a problem since World War II aircraft were quite small The use of a gasoil separator today called a bladder solved the problem

Greer and Mercier formed a patent company GreerOlaer and Greer Hydraulics became the sole licensee with the rights to continue development and to license other companies outside the US From the early 1950s bladdertype accumulators became the unit that was specified and used in almost every application where hydraulics was employed  machine tools plastic machinery circuit breakers rock crushers oil drilling farm and road machinery to name a few

Greer Hydraulics was later acquired by ParkerHannifin of Cleveland Ohio

Mercier was awarded the Franklin Institutes Certificate of Merit in 1951 He was also decorated Chevalier de la Legion dhonneur by the French Republic

Panthir  Panther was an which served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 19121946

The ship along with her three sister ships  and  had originally been ordered by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead Panthir was originally named Santiago del Estero They were purchased in 1912 by Greece ready for delivery each for the sum of 148000 when the Balkan Wars seemed likely Accepted by Captain Ath Miaoulis RHN in Palermo Sicily where she arrived manned by a foreign crew

During the Balkan Wars the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition 3000 rounds of torpedoes Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship and for this reason these ships were initially named scouts rather than destroyers

During World War I Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and due to Greeces neutrality the four Aetosclass ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916 taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 191718 By 1918 they were back on escort duty under Greek colors mainly in the Aegean Sea

Colombian weasel
Colombian weasel Mustela felipei also known as the Don Felipes weasel is a very rare species of weasel only known with certainty from the departments of Huila and Cauca in Colombia and nearby northern Ecuador where only known from a single specimen Both its scientific and alternative common name honours the mammalogist Philip Don Felipe Hershkovitz

It appears to be largely restricted to riparian habitats at an altitude of  There is extensive deforestation within its limited distribution within the northern Andes of Colombia and Ecuador and with less than ten known specimens it is probably the rarest carnivoran in South America It is considered vulnerable by the IUCN

It is the second smallest living carnivore on average being only slightly larger than the least weasel Mustela nivalis and slightly smaller than the ermine or stoat M erminea The upperparts and tail are blackishbrown while the underparts are orangebuff

M felipei has an elongated body with an average length of  and a tail long Weight ranges between  M felipei has a dark dorsal color with no variation ventrally the weasel has a light orange color with gradual fading of color up to the head Hair color from the tail to the nose is uniform with no striping or spotting M felipei has an inflated auditory bulla located near the dorsal midline on the body along with a wide mesopterygoid fossa The soles of the feet lack any fur and extensive webbing is located on the second third and fourth digits suggesting a semiaquatic lifestyle

M felipei is one of the least studied carnivore species in the Americas and is expected to maintain a larger geographical range that currently known Reports of sightings have placed M felipei in the mountain ranges of western Colombia to northern Ecuador M felipei was originally thought to be endemic to Colombia however recent specimens have been collected in Ecuador that have since proven this thought wrong Distribution and habitat modeling surveys have been able to predict that M felipei is distributed between 20 protected areas in Colombia and 14 in Ecuador along with three previously known locations in both countries the majority of these locations lie in protected areas of the forest

From geographic modeling and collected specimens it has been concluded that Mustela felipei lives in largely riparian habitats primarily staying close to rivers streams and along the shorelines of other natural water sources Since this habitat lies in an elevation range of it is classified as being in a cloud forest consisting of 100 humidity adding to the riparian habitat

M felipei is a carnivorous mammal that preys primarily on fish other small aquatic animals and small terrestrial mammals Hunting is aided by the use of webbed feet and camouflaged fur

Mustela felipei has been recognized by the IUCN as being vulnerable and having a decreasing population However due to rarity of sighting and deforestation of known habitat it remains unclear as to the true numbers of individuals that make up the population

Ameny Qemau
Ameny Qemau was an Egyptian pharaoh of the 13th Dynasty during the Second Intermediate Period According to Egyptologists Kim Ryholt and Darrell Baker he was the 5th king of the dynasty reigning for 2 years over most of Egypt except perhaps the eastern Nile Delta from 1793 BC until 1791 BC

The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt notes that Ameny Qemaus name is essentially a filiative nomen that is a name specifying the filiation of its holder Indeed Ameny Qemau could be read as Amenys son Qemau Ryholt concludes that the Ameny in question was Qemaus predecessor Sekhemkare Amenemhat V and that Qemau was his son This opinion is shared by Egyptologist Darrell Baker but not by Jrgen von Beckerath who left Ameny Qemaus position within the 13th Dynasty undetermined in his handbook of Egyptian pharaohs The successor of Ameny Qemau Qemau Siharnedjheritef may have been his son as Qemau Siharnedjheritef may be read The son of Qemau Horus protects his father

Beyond his pyramid in Dahshur Ameny Qemau is a poorly attested king his name does not appear on the Turin canon and the only contemporary attestations of him are fragments of four inscribed canopic jars found in the pyramid An additional plaquette of unknown provenance bears his name but may be a modern forgery
Ameny Qemaus identity is therefore uncertain and attempts have been made to identify him with better attested kings of the period in particular with Sehotepibre who appears on the Turin canon after Amenemhat V Ryholt however believes that Qemaus name was lost in a wsf lacuna of the Turin canon located just before Amenemhat V A wsf literally missing lacuna denotes a lacuna in the original document from which the canon was copied in Ramesside times

Ameny Qemau had a pyramid built for himself in the south of Dahshur The pyramid was discovered in 1957 by Charles Muss and only investigated in 1968 It originally measured 50 square meters at its base and stood 35 meters high but is now completely ruined due to stone robbing The substructures have also been extensively damaged The burial chamber of the king was made of a single large block of quartzite similar to those found in the pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara and the Mazghuna pyramids The block was hewn to receive the sarcophagus and canopic jars of the king but only fragments of these and unidentified bones where found onsite

Additionally the name of Ameny Qemau is believed to appear on an inscribed block which was found in a newlydiscovered pyramid at Dahshur whose existence was announced in April 2017 Many Egyptologists such as James P Allen Aidan Dodson and Thomas Schneider agrees that the royal name on the block is that of Ameny Qemau Dodson further speculated that given the relatively poor quality of the inscription and the oddity for a pharaoh to be the owner of two pyramids the newlydiscovered one may have originally belonged to one of Qemaus predecessors and that he may have usurped the structure by chiseling out the royal names on the block and superimposing his own cartouches on it Among the artifacts found in the burial chamber were a sarcophagus canopic jars and boxes of wrappings Inscriptions on the boxes mention one of the daughters of Ameny Qemau Hatshepsut suggesting that the pyramid may have been usurped for his daughter and may explain why he has two pyramids

Poem for Rent
Poem for Rent is a nonprofit project for arts distribution founded in Israel Poems on bulletin boards are posted in the same format as standard house for rent posts with several detachable tearoffs on the bottom Instead of a telephone number quotes from the poem are written on the tearoffs This way anyone who passes by can read the poem and pick a tearoff with a quote they liked from the poem

The first poems for rent were posted in Israel during October 2005 One of those was documented in the Hebrew creation site Tzura  Those were poems of famous Israeli poets such as Yehuda Amichai and Nathan Zach as well as poems of the Polish poet Nobel Prize winner Wislawa Szymborska 

In 2006 the concept expanded to other types of arts such as painting for rent and comics for rent The project has also expanded geographically poems for rent have appeared in Switzerland and The Netherlands In its summer 2006 issue the Dutch poetry magazine Awater dedicated an article to the project titled Wat Bezielt What Inspires

Richard D Gill
Richard David Gill born 11 September 1951 is a mathematician born in the United Kingdom who has lived in the Netherlands since 1974 As a probability theorist and statistician Gill is most well known for his research on counting processes and survival analysis some of which has appeared in an advanced textbook He is the chair of mathematical statistics at Leiden University Gill is also known for his pro bono consulting and advocacy on behalf of victims of incompetent statistical testimony including a Dutch nurse who was wrongfully convicted and jailed for six years

He studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge 19701973 and subsequently followed the Diploma of Statistics course there 19731974

Marrying a Dutch woman he moved to the Netherlands where he worked from 1974 to 1988 at the Mathematical Centre later renamed Centrum Wiskunde  Informatica or CWI of Amsterdam In 1979 Gill obtained his PhD with the thesis Censoring and Stochastic Integrals which was supervised by Jacobus Oosterhoff of the Vrije Universiteit which awarded the doctorate Gill spent Autumn 1980 at the Statistical Research Unit at the University of Copenhagen Gill continued to collaborate with Danish and Norwegian statisticians for ten years helping to write the book Statistical models based on counting processes which is often referred to as ABGK for the authors Andersen Borgan Gill and Keiding In 1983 he became the head of the Department of Mathematical Statistics at CWI

In 1988 he moved to the Department of Mathematics of Utrecht University Gill became the chair in mathematical stochasticsthis chair represented the three mathematical sciences of mathematical statistics probability theory and operations research His PhD students include Sara van de Geer and Mark vanderLaan

In 2006 he moved to the Department of Mathematics at Leiden University where he became the chair of mathematical statistics Since then he has conducted statistical research in the theory of quantum information and in biostatistics He has also worked on survival analysis semiparametric models causality missing data machine learning and statistics in image analysis Gill also publishes on the foundations of several mathematical sciences the foundations of statistics of probability of mathematics and of quantum physics

In recent years he has lobbied for retrials for Lucia de Berk and Kevin Sweeney The nurse Lucia de Berk was sentenced to life imprisonment after a legal psychologist gave testimony that there was great likelihood that de Berk committed a string of murdersThe court was told by Dr Henk Elffers of the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement that more children had died on her shifts than appeared possible by chance He put the odds of her presence being a mere coincidence at one in 342 million a figure that seemed to have blinded the court to any alternative explanation of the deathsThis statistical testimony was shown to be fallacious by professional statisticians notably Gill Continued scrutiny showed that the data had also been collected to support the prosecutors conviction of Berk which further invalidated the pseudostatistical testimony

The conduct of the case in Professor Gills account was extraordinary Convinced she was guilty the police and the managers of the Juliana Childrens Hospital assembled a dossier in which it seemed every death became unnatural when it had occurred during or after a shift in which she had worked For one of the alleged murders it was established on appeal she had not even been in the hospital for three days around the time it occurred Using more appropriate statistical methods reduced the odds from one in342million to one in48 A further analysis by Professor Gill further reduces the odds to one in nine

Professor Gill helped in the campaign to have a new trial Consequently a retrial was ordered and de Berk was found not guilty and received a public apology from the Dutch government along with financial compensation amount unknown for her six years of incarceration

Richard Gill is a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences He is a past president of The Netherlands Society for Statistics and Operations Research which publishes the journal Statistica Neerlandica Gill was selected as the 20102011 Distinguished Lorentz Fellow by the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences

Founded in 1998 the club started out as Canon ENM Coached by Allan Dorbek the team joined toptier Korvpalli Meistriliiga KML for the 199899 season The clubs first season was a disappointment as the team finished in last place without winning a single game In 1999 the team was renamed Ehitustriist The teams results improved slowly as Ehitustriist finished the league in 7th place for four consecutive seasons In 2003 the club merged with Audentes and became EhitustriistAudentes while the former Estonia national team coach Maarten van Gent was hired as head coach The team finished the 200304 season in 5th place After the season EhitustriistAudentes dissolved and both clubs continued separately

In 2004 Ehitustriist moved to the new 7200seat Saku Suurhall The team finished the 200405 regular season with a 124 record and dominant in the playoffs In the finals they faced University of Tartu Ehitustriist won the series and the teams first Estonian Championship 4 games to 3 Howard Frier was named Most Valuable Player of the season The team also competed in the regional Baltic Basketball League for the first time finishing in 7th place with an 810 record

Coming off their first Estonian Championship Ehitustriist leased the trademark Kalev from AS Kalev and became BC KalevCramo Allan Dorbek was replaced as head coach by former Estonia national team shooting guard Aivar Kuusmaa for the 200506 season On 2 October 2005 the team won their first Estonian Cup defeating University of Tartu 7064 in the final KalevCramo also made their debut in Europe entering the 200506 season of the FIBA EuroCup but failed to advance past the group stage with just one victory in 6 games In the KML KalevCramo finished the regular season in first place with a 213 record and reached the finals in the playoffs The team defended their title defeating University of Tartu 4 games to 3 winning the deciding seventh game 6968 James Williams was named Finals MVP and Kuusmaa won the Coach of the Year award Despite that Kuusmaa was replaced by Veselin Mati for the 200607 season 

The team won their second Estonian Cup in 2006 but was unable to defend the title KalevCramo reached the finals but lost the series 24 to University of Tartu Despite losing in the finals Valmo Kriisa won the Estonian Player of the Year award while Travis Reed was named KML and BBL MVP and Mati won the Coach of the Year award KalevCramo saw limited success in Europe reaching the second round in the 200607 FIBA EuroCup and competing in the European second tier 200708 ULEB Cup but a record of 37 wasnt enough to advance past the group stage The team won another Estonian Cup in 2007 and reached the finals in the 200708 season but were swept by University of Tartu

In 2008 New Zealand national team coach Nenad Vuini replaced Mati as head coach KalevCramo won their fourth consecutive Estonian Cup in 2008 The team finished the 200809 regular season in second place In the semifinals KalevCramo easily dispatched TT in three games to reach the finals In the finals the team defeated University of Tartu 4 games to 2 and captured their third title Forward Kristjan Kangur was named Finals MVP and the Estonian Player of the Year In 2009 the team joined the newly established VTB United League In December 2009 Vuini left KalevCramo The team struggled in the 200910 season and finished the regular season in fourth place with a 199 record under the former assistant coach Alar Varrak The team lost in the semifinals to University of Tartu but won the bronze medals in the third place games winning the series in two games against TT

In July 2010 Aivar Kuusmaa returned to KalevCramo Led by Gregor Arbet and Armands le the team finished the 201011 regular season in first place In the playoffs KalevCramo swept Rakvere Tarvas in the semifinals 30 and University of Tartu in the finals 40 le was named Finals MVP and Kuusmaa won his second Coach of the Year award KalevCramo defended their title in the 201112 season defeating Tartu likool in the finals in a fourgame sweep Tanel Sokk was named Finals MVP and Kuusmaa once again won the Coach of the Year award

KalevCramo struggled early in the 201213 season and after a 6995 defeat to Rakvere Tarvas on 22 November 2012 Kuusmaa was sacked with assistant coach Alar Varrak taking over the coaching reins Despite the poor start KalevCramo finished the regular season in first place and swept the playoffs KalevCramo won their 6th Estonian Championship as Tanel Sokk claimed his second straight Finals MVP award Alar Varrak was named Coach of the Year The team also placed third in the 201213 Baltic Basketball League With star players Gregor Arbet and Frank Elegar and the additions of Vlad Moldoveanu and Rain Veideman the teams success continued in the 201314 season KalevCramo once again finished the regular season in first place and was undefeated in the playoffs KalevCramo won their fourth consecutive Estonian Championship while Moldoveanu was named Finals MVP and Varrak won his second Coach of the Year award The team finished the 201415 regular season in second place KalevCramo swept TT in the quarterfinals and Rapla in the semifinals In the finals KalevCramo once again faced University of Tartu but lost the series 14 On 20 December 2015 KalevCramo won their fifth Estonian Cup defeating University of Tartu 7355 in the final KalevCramo finished the 201516 season regular season in first place and undefeated The team extended their winning streak in the quarter and semifinals In the finals the team faced University of Tartu and won the series 4 games to 1 the single loss being the teams only defeat in the season Rolands Freimanis was named Finals MVP KalevCramo defended their title in the 201617 season facing Rapla in the finals and winning the series 4 games to 0 Branko Mirkovi was named Finals MVP The team won their third consecutive league title in the 201718 season defeating University of Tartu in the finals 4 games to 0 Kristjan Kangur who returned to the club for the season was named Finals MVP

Waconda Spring
Waconda Spring or Great Spirit Spring was a natural artesian spring located in Mitchell County near the towns of Glen Elder and Cawker City in the US state of Kansas It was a sacred site for Native American tribes of the Great Plains and for a time became the site of a health spa for American settlers With the completion of the Glen Elder Dam in 1968 the mineral spring disappeared beneath the waters of Waconda Reservoir

Waconda Spring was situated on the bank of the Solomon River below the North and South Forks of the river
The water flowing from the spring had deposited a large cone of travertine around it
In 1866 surveyor David E Ballard described it

The Spring itself is a natural curiousity it being located on the summit of a cone shaped limestone rock The rock is circular about 200 feet in diameter at the base and about 30 feet high upon the summit of this rests the spring the basin being circular and about 30 feet in diameter its outlet is a trough apparently formed by the action of the water upon the rock The water in the spring is about 20 feet deep and exceedingly strong with salt 

The name Waconda is from the Kanza language and translates as spirit water or Great Spirit Spring However it is located in territory controlled by the Pawnee
who knew it by the names Pahowa and Kitzawitzuk the latter translated as water on a bank 

In the Pawnee traditional religion the supreme being Tirawa allots supernatural powers to certain animals These animals the nahurac act as Tirawas servants and messengers and intercede for the Pawnee with Tirawa 

The nahurac had five lodges of which Waconda Spring was one The foremost among them was Pahuk usually translated hill island a bluff on the south side of the Platte River near the town of Cedar Bluffs in presentday Saunders County Nebraska 
Lalawakohtito or dark island was an island in the Platte near Central City Nebraska Ahkawitakol or white bank was on the Loup River opposite the mouth of the Cedar River in what is now Nance County Nebraska and Pahur or hill that points the way was a bluff south of the Republican River near Guide Rock Nebraska

Beside the Pawnee many other Native American tribes venerated Waconda Spring often casting articles of value into it as offerings George Bird Grinnell describes the offerings of the Pawnee as including blankets and robes blue beads eagle feathers and moccasins

A geoglyph produced by the intaglio technique of removing the surface sod to form a figure is located on a hillside about two miles southwest of Waconda Spring The figure represents an unidentified animal possibly a beaver It is thought to be several hundred years old soil analysis indicates that it was renewed at least once after its initial excavation suggesting that it was in use over an extended period of time

It is said that the first European explorer to visit Waconda Spring was Sir William Johnson in 1767 however this is unlikely The first recorded visit to the site was by General Zebulon Pike in 1806 Pike visited the spring during his exploration of the Great Plains after he had concluded a treaty with the Pawnee

Settlement in the area did not take place until after Kansas became a state in 1861 The first settler in the region was in 1870 by a man named Pfeiffer who took out the first claim on the property Kansas Senator Samuel C Pomeroy toured the region in 1870 and marveled at what he saw Said Pomeroy At first I declared it the Crater of an Ancient Volcano The Water occupying its hollow center is fathomless and about 200 feet in diameter in a perfect circle It is always brimming full and running over on all sides  The hills about it were as sacred to the Indians as those about Jerusalem Pomeroy recognized the sites commercial potential and went on to predict that a health resort would soon be built in the region

Within a few years a man named Burnham constructed a bottling works on the site and began selling the mineral water as a health tonic He called it Waconda Flier The sales of Waconda Flier piqued the interest of an eastern investor named McWilliams who in 1884 invested in the site and began the construction of a stone sanitarium The spring was fenced off and completely privatized The building was completed ten years later and under the management of G W Cooper Waconda Spring became a hotel and health spa Sales of Waconda Flier continued and by the 1890s it was being sold in all parts of the country In 1904 Waconda Flier won a medal for its superior medicinal qualities at the St Louis Worlds Fair

In 1906 Dr G P Abrahams purchased the property from McWilliams and continued operating the health spa and bottling plant until his 1924 death In 1924 the property passed to Dr Carl Bingesser who had married Abrahams daughter Anna in 1907 Under both Abrahams and Bingesser the hotel resort was improved upon and maintained a solid reputation as health spa and place of healing It continued to do so even as the spa passed on to Dr Carlos Bingesser the third generation of the AbrahamsBingesser family to own and operate the spa The facilities were fully modernized and offered physical therapy hydrotherapy electrotherapy and dietary regimens Water from Waconda Spring was used for internal and external cleansing of the body It was piped into every bathtub in the sanitarium was served with meals and used for enemas A popular slogan used to lure tourists to the resort was It will clean works until your works work Waconda Spring was a popular profitable enterprise for the Bingesser family

In 1944 the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers announced plans for a large earthen dam on the Solomon River near the town of Glen Elder The plan called for the inundation of Waconda Spring The Bingesser family fought to stop the plan but in 1951 greater than normal rainfall in Kansas led to massive flooding in Topeka and other Kansas towns This led to renewed calls for dams and other flood control projects including renewed calls for the Glen Elder Dam Dr Bingesser brought in a respected hydrologist to inspect Waconda Spring The hydrologist concluded that Waconda Spring was unique and possibly the only spring like it in the world However commercial advocates in favor of the dam dismissed the hydrologist and dismissively claimed that Waconda Spring was nothing more than a mud hole

In the end the developers won Construction on Glen Elder Dam began in 1964 and was completed by the end of 1968 Engineers bulldozed the hotel and health spa then adding insult to injury dumped the debris into the pool of Waconda Spring Water from the Solomon River began filling up the valley and by 1970 it was full The irreplaceable Waconda Spring was lost beneath the waters of the reservoir that now bears its name

No 298 Squadron RAF
No 298 Squadron was a Royal Air Force special operations squadron during the Second World War Later in that war it changed to the transport role disbanding after the end of the hostilities

No 298 Squadron was formed on 24 August 1942 at RAF Thruxton from a nucleus of 297 Squadron as a special operations squadron equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley The squadron was however not required for operations so the formation was suspended and the squadron was disbanded on 19 October 1942

The squadron was reformed on 4 November 1943 at RAF Tarrant Rushton from A Flight of 295 Squadron with the Handley Page Halifax It trained to airtow the big General Aircraft Hamilcar glider but began operations in February 1944 in its original role dropping SOE agents On 16 March 1944 298 Squadrons C Flight split off to form 644 squadron

During the Normandy landing the squadron airtowed both the Airspeed Horsas and the Hamilcars to landingzones around the beach head An unusual operation involved parachuting jeeps which had been carried underneath the Halifax The squadron then returned again to SOE duties In between the SOE duties the squadron airtowed Hamilcar and Horsa gliders for the Arnhem landing Operation Market Garden The squadron moved in March 1945 to RAF Woodbridge England to airtow gliders for the Rhine crossing Operation Varsity After Operation Varsity the squadron flew normal supply and transport duties

In July 1945 the squadron moved to Raipur British India to provide transport support to the Army In March 1946 the squadron was involved in ricedropping sorties from Meiktila Burma to the starving population in the jungle areas The squadron disbanded at Mauripur Sindh British India Now Pakistan Air Force Base Masroor on 21 December or 30 December 1946

BMW R602
The R60 and R602 are 600cc boxertwin that were manufactured from 1956 to 1969 in Munich Germany by BMW

Some 20133 of these 600cc shaftdrive opposed twin R60 19561960  R602 19601969  and R60US 19681969 30hp were built These models except for those with the US designation were designed primarily as rugged motorcycles to pull sidecars mounting points were built in and had duplex tubular steel frames

Simultaneously manufactured were related models including the 500cc R50 19551960  the R502 19601969 26hp the R50 S 19601962  the R50US 19681969 26hp and the 600cc sportoriented R69 19551960 35hp R69S 19601969  and R69US 19681969 42hp

In the United States all these Earlesfork and USfork ie telescopic fork models from 1955 to 1969 are often lumped together as Slash2 BMWs even though that is technically incorrect Not all of them as seen above have the 2 designation

Perhaps the most famous BMW rider of the 1960s was Danny Liska who took R60 models from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego in one trip and from Europes North Cape to South Africas Cape of Good Hope in a second journey His book about the first trip Two Wheels to Adventure Alaska to Argentina by Motorcycle was published in 1989 with a second edition published in 2004 In the book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance John and Sylvia accompany Robert Pirsig the author and his son Chris on a 1968 road trip from Minnesota to San Francisco riding a BMW R60 Throughout the book Pirsig contrasts his passion and care in taking care of his bike to Johns fear of technology The BMW is famous for not giving mechanical problems on the road and thats what he is counting on

Though BMW first used oildamped telescopic front forks in the 1930s it chose to use Earles forks on these models The triangular front Earles fork named after its designer Englishman Ernest Earles
precluded any frontend dive during heavy front braking which is common with telescopic front forks It also worked well in sidecar duty Though heavy and ponderous in turning the Earles fork gave the old Beemer a steady and reassuring ride

In 1968 BMW introduced telescopic forks on some of its slash2 models and they were continued into the 1969 model year Modified they became the front forks on the slash5 models introduced for the 1970 model year The photo of the red R60US to the right was taken at a BMW dealership in 1968 and shows a brandnew motorcycle waiting for its first buyer Earles fork and telescopic fork models both were manufactured for these two years and were available to customers

During the 1960s very few motorcycles were available with shaft final drive BMWs were the most common The driveshaft rode in an enclosed oil bath within the right swingarm unlike BMWs previous models and drove the rear wheel through an internally splined cup that meshes with a coupler crown gear keyed to the drive pinion This meant that leaking seals could become a problem for the owners Because the clutch was dry there were seals at the rear of the crankshaft at both ends of the transmission at the rear of the driveshaft and at the front and rear of the rear drive unit lots of seals to develop leaks

The front brakes were double leading shoes and the rear had a single leading shoe By modern standards they were not good brakes Tires front and rear were interchangeable in 350inch by 18inch size

Motorcycles sold in America had high handlebars with a cross brace Those sold elsewhere came with low Euro handlebars

A variety of saddle styles were available for these motorcycles Those delivered in the U S typically were supplied with a single dual or bench saddle either the standard size or a wide version that came with chrome rearquarter passenger handles Alternatives available included a Denfeld not Denfield or Pagusa solo drivers saddle or individual driver and passenger saddles

BMW motorcycles of the 1960s were noted as longdistance touring motorcycles However none came standard with fairings or luggage these items were provided by aftermarket vendors
Fairings included the Wixom Ranger handlebarmounted fairing made in Illinois and Avon
There were numerous manufacturers of saddle bags and top cases for BMW twins in the 1960s including Wixom Britishmade Craven and leather saddlebags imported by Butler and Smith who also offered several styles of luggage carriers for mounting behinds the passenger saddle It also offered several styles of windshields safety bars a spotlight metric tool kits and a mechanical tachometer

US motorcycles came standard with a narrow dual saddle though wide dual saddles with chrome rear handles could be ordered Solo saddles made by Pagusa or Denfeld for driver and passenger were also available All motorcycles came with a tool kit Hella turn signals were optional photo below left and were mounted at the ends of the handlebars showing light both forward and back

The standard fuel tank held  though a commonly purchased option was a more bulbous tank Also available as options were sport tanks of and capacities

An oval shaped safety bar photo right was available for all 195569 BMW motorcycles from the American importer Butler and Smith New York

<doc id="7716582" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716582" title="Aniseikonia">
Aniseikonia
Aniseikonia is an ocular condition where there is a significant difference in the perceived size of images It can occur as an overall difference between the two eyes or as a difference in a particular meridian

When this magnification difference becomes excessive the effect can cause diplopia suppression disorientation eyestrain headache and dizziness and balance disorders

Retinal image size is determined by many factors The size and position of the object being viewed affects the characteristics of the light entering the system Corrective lenses affect these characteristics and are used commonly to correct refractive error The optics of the eye including its refractive power and axial length also play a major role in retinal image size

Aniseikonia can occur naturally or be induced by the correction of a refractive error usually anisometropia having significantly different refractive errors between each eye or antimetropia being myopic nearsighted in one eye and hyperopic farsighted in the other Meridional aniseikonia occurs when these refractive differences only occur in one meridian see astigmatism Refractive surgery can cause aniseikonia in much the same way that it is caused by glasses and contacts

One cause of significant anisometropia and subsequent aniseikonia has been aphakia Aphakic patients do not have a crystalline lens The crystalline lens is often removed because of opacities called cataracts The absence of this lens left the patient highly hyperopic farsighted in that eye For some patients the removal was only performed on one eye resulting in the anisometropia  aniseikonia Today this is rarely a problem because when the lens is removed in cataract surgery an intraocular lens or IOL is left in its place

A way to demonstrate aniseikonia is to hold a near target ex pen or finger approximately 6 inches directly in front of one eye The person then closes one eye and then the other The person should notice that the target appears larger to the eye that it is directly in front of When this object is viewed with both eyes it is seen with a small amount of aniseikonia The principles behind this demonstration are relative distance magnification closer objects appear larger and asymmetrical convergence the target is not an equal distance from each eye

Treatment is done by changing the optical magnification properties of the auxiliary optics corrective lenses The optical magnification properties of spectacle lenses can be adjusted by changing parameters like the base curve vertex distance and center thickness Contact lenses may also provide a better optical magnification to reduce the difference in image size The difference in magnification can also be eliminated by a combination of contact lenses and glasses creating a weak telescope system The optimum design solution will depend on different parameters like cost cosmetic implications and if the patient can tolerate wearing a contact lens

Note however that before the optics can be designed first the aniseikonia should be measured When the image disparity is astigmatic cylindrical and not uniform images can appear wider taller or diagonally different When the disparity appears to vary across the visual field fielddependent aniseikonia as may be the case with an epiretinal membrane or retinal detachment the aniseikonia cannot fully be corrected with traditional optical techniques like standard corrective lenses However partial correction often improves the patients vision comfort significantly Little is known yet about the possibilities of using surgical intervention to correct aniseikonia

Tamajdan Sports and Recreation Center
Tamajdan Sports and Recreation Center  abbr Tamajdan SRC commonly known simply as Ta  literally Tash is a sporting and recreational center located in the city of Belgrade Serbia It was founded by the Assembly of the City of Belgrade in 1958

At within the center located of the outdoor Tamajdan Stadium the Aleksandar Nikoli Hall the Pionir Ice Hall and a complex of outdoor and indoor swimming pools

Built with white stone from Bra island and opened on 24 January 1954 by mid 2000s the stadium began showing signs of structural deterioration Architect Mihajlo Jankovi was awarded the Belgrades October award for architecture the highest city award at the time for the Tamajdan project Originally the sports complex started as the ice factory where people could buy the socalled hygienic ice

Some of the best known happenings in the venue include EuroBasket Women 1954 first Miss Yugoslavia contest in 1957 won by Tonka Katunari 1957 World Womens Handball Championship the inaugural world women championship concerts of Alexandrov Ensemble in 1958 and later in the 1960s and 1970s of Mazowsze Elton John Ray Charles and Tina Turner and ice hockey matches with over 10000 spectators Yugoslav national tennis team played the Davis Cup matches in 1956 in Tamajdan and the curiosities held in the facility include the chess with live figures the football matches played by the Zastava 750 cars and the first Spanish corrida in Europe outside of Spain when Luis Miguel Domingun performed Tamajdan hosted the first FINA World Aquatics Championships in 1973

After the 197778 season the ice skating rink was dismantled in March 1978 Bad conditions of the facility in the 2000s led many public personalities in Belgrade Cane Kosti Neda Arneri Branko Cveji to urge the city government to do something about it In midApril 2009 the initiative called Ta je na  Ta is ours was held to draw public attention to the sad state of the crumbling facility In the summer of 2009 the stadium was closed to the public due to the impending reconstruction An extensive RSD550million renovation began in September 2011 Originally the reconstruction was to be finished in December 2012 then was postponed to 2014 and was finally completed in 2016 As the object is under the protection the conceptual solution for the reconstruction had to fully preserve the original authors concept Since 2016 the ice skating rink became operational again during the winter It covers and though it worked only for less than 60 days in 2016 it had 30000 visitors

The outdoor swimming pool was opened on 25 June 1961 Its capacity is 2500 and swimming beaches hold around 4000 people

The indoor swimming pool was opened on 13 December 1968 The pools dimensions are 5020m The capacity for spectators is 2000 seats Within the same building there is a recreation center a gym a small swimming pool and a hotel named Ta

Pasteur pipette
Pasteur pipettes also known as droppers or eye droppers are used to transfer small quantities of liquids They are usually glass tubes tapered to a narrow point and fitted with a rubber bulb at the top The combination of the Pasteur pipette and rubber bulb has also been referred to as a teat pipette Pasteur pipettes come in various lengths and are usually sold in boxes of hundreds They are named after the French scientist Louis Pasteur who was known to have used a variant of them extensively during his research In the past there was no equipment to transfer a chemical solution without exposing it to the external environment The hygiene and purity of chemical compounds is necessary for the expected result of each experiment The Pasteur pipette both glass and plastic types are sterilized and plugged with a rubber bulb at the open end of the pipette preventing any contamination from the atmosphere Generally they are considered cheap enough to be disposable however so long as the glass point is not chipped the Pasteur pipette may be washed and reused indefinitely

The name eye dropper also may refer to early models of fountainpens which have to be refilled with some kind of Pasteur pipette

It is not recommended to use pasteur pipettes for work involving accuracy since pasteur pipettes are not designed to measure specific volume however it can be used to add drops of reagents Before using a pasteur pipette the tip should be carefully examined for cracks To increase accuracy the pipette is to be rinsed with the reagent To use the pipette squeeze the bulb to expel air out of the pipette and submerge the tip of the pipette to the solution vertically Gently relax the bulb to draw the solution up and make sure that the solution does not overshoot into the bulb contaminating it To dispense the reagent hold the tip against the side of the target container at a 30 to 45 degrees angle

Broken pasteur pipettes should be disposed of in an appropriate glassware container

Nowadays the two types of glass that are used mainly in the laboratory and in the Pasteur pipette are borosilicate glass and soda lime glass Borosilicate glass is a widely used glass for laboratory apparatus as it can withstand chemicals and temperatures used in most laboratories Borosilicate glass is also more economical since the glass can be fabricated easily compared to other types Soda lime glass although not as chemically resistant as Borosilicate glass are suitable as a material for inexpensive apparatus such as the Pasteur pipette

Plastic Pasteur pipettes also referred to as transfer pipettes have their stems and bulbs in the form of a single piece made of plastic They commonly come in 1 2 3 and 5 ml which comes with a specific drop size of 10 20 25 35 and 50 l The volumes are usually marked on the stem though the markings are rather crude and are not particularly accurate

As plastic Pasteur is relatively inexpensive and disposable they are often used to avoid crosscontamination In a solution containing cell andor protein it reduces the loss of cell andor protein that binds to glass The designation of the plastic pipettes contain the long flexible tube It can be bent for drawing solution from small volume tubes

Plastic Pasteur pipettes are often used in biology where most media are aqueous and solvent resistance is not important Most organic solvents such as hexane and acetone cannot be used in plastic Pasteur pipettes as the solvent can dissolve the plastic The pipettes are also hard to wash and are usually discarded with other biohazard waste after each use

Plastic bulb pipettes are generally not precise enough to be used for exact measurements whereas their glass counterparts can be extremely precise

The constriction toward the tip of the Pasteur pipettes may be plugged with a bit of tissue paper or cotton wool to filter off solids from small amounts of liquids The bulb can be attached and squeezed to help viscous solutions filter more rapidly

With a bit of skill Pasteur pipettes may also be used for microscale column chromatography With appropriately fine silica gel the bulb may be squeezed for microscale flash column chromatography

Pasteur pipettes can also be used for microscale distillation The liquid to be distilled is placed into a small reaction tube along with a boiling chip and heated to reflux onehalf to twothirds of the way up the inside of the tube After squeezing the bulb to expel air a pasteur pipette is inserted into the tube just below the level of the ring of refluxing liquid into the vapor The vapor is then drawn into the relatively cold pipette tip causing it to condense and accumulate inside of the pipette

Heat can be applied to the tip of a plastic Pasteur pipette to seal the solution and create a liquidtight storage

Medical Laboratory

Medical Laboratory required high efficiency and precision for drug test and observation of diseases Pasteur pipettes are commonly used in the medical lab because of its essential accuracy The design of the Pasteur pipette allows for high effective performance in the medical lab It produces a constant volume of drop This reduces the concern of liquid remaining in the pipette

Ross Technology
Ross Technology Inc was a semiconductor design and manufacturing company specializing in SPARC microprocessors It was founded in Austin Texas in August 1988 by Dr Roger D Ross a leading computer scientist who headed Motorolas Advanced Microprocessor Division and directed the developments of Motorolas MC68030 and RISCbased 88000 microprocessor families

Dr Ross was accompanied by Carl Dobbs Janet Sooch Steve Goldstein and Travor Smith who were from Motorolas Highend Microprocessor Division and were involved in the development of the 88000 microprocessor He was later was joined by Am29000 engineer Raju Vegesna from AMD who was originally hired by Dr Ross at Motorola

Cypress Semiconductor provided initial funding Original board members included Dr Ross and wellknown figures as Dr T J Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Venture Capital and L J Sevin of Sevin Rosen Venture Capital who also served as Board Chairman Ross eventually became a subsidiary of Cypress

In September 1988 the company was tied up in a lawsuit launched by Motorola Motorola alleged that Ross and the other former Motorola staff had proprietary marketing material as well as all the 68000 and 88000 technical data and sought a temporary injunction and 8 million in compensation and punitive damages Motorola offered to settle the lawsuit without litigation if the former Motorola staff agreed not to work on modern computer architecture for 18 months In late September 1988 Motorola withdrew the temporary injunction after former Motorola staff agreed not to compromise proprietary information regarding the 68000 and 88000 microprocessors The lawsuit was settled in October

In midOctober after the lawsuit from Motorola was settled AMD launched a lawsuit over the hiring of Raju Vegesna who was involved in the design of the Am29000 It was settled in late October with AMD getting limited rights to inspect Ross RISCrelated designs

Ross first products were SPARC chip sets On 23 April 1990 Cypress announced the CY7C611 a microprocessor developed by Ross for embedded applications Later Ross was tasked by Cypress to develop the Pinnacle microprocessor a superscalar SPARC implementation intended to compete with the Sun Microsystems and Texas Instruments SuperSPARC In May 1993 Pinnacle was revealed to be the hyperSPARC and the microprocessor was announced in May 1993

Cypress had bet the companys success on the hyperSPARC threatening to abandon SPARC in favor of Digital Equipment Corporations Alpha if Sun did not endorse the design Although International Computers Limited and Meiko Scientific were claimed by Cypress to be major customers of hyperSPARC the microprocessor was used in small quantities and by a handful of small vendors Repeated delays in shipping the design as a result of design and fabrication problems at Cypress contributed to the small number of users

As the hyperSPARC had failed to win major customers Cypress sold Ross to Fujitsu for 23 million on 12 May 1993 Fujitsu was interested in Ross for its hyperSPARC design which it considered to be competitive At the time Fujitsus SPARC business was limited to embedded designs after an unsuccessful attempt in the early 1990s to develop a highend SPARC when the market for such designs was limited After several government oversight committee hearings in Washington DC the sale was permitted to proceed Under Fujitsu the existing Board of Directors was replaced with its own members with the exception of Dr Ross who was named chairman

The company was taken public by Robertson Stephens  Company on 7 November 1995 but Fujitsu kept a controlling interest in the company and continued to control the Board of Directors Sun Microsystems also took a 10 interest in the company and was allowed to name a director as well

In February 1996 Ross Technology formed Ross Microcomputer in Sonoma California to produce workstations and servers for valueadded resellers VARs and original equipment manufacturers OEMs Their first product the hyperStation was known since the divisions creation and was introduced in June 1996 The systems used hyperSPARC microprocessors

In 1995 Sun Microsystems introduced the 64bit UltraSPARC microprocessor As Sun was the dominant SPARC vendor the majority of the market followed and began the migration to 64bit SPARC As a result the 32bit SPARC market began to decline

Ross did not have a 64bit SPARC microprocessor and was at a disadvantage as a result Combined with the creation of Ross Microcomputer earlier in the year which incurred restructuring and other costs they began to lose money An effort to regain the companys competitiveness was active at the time and it involved developing a new 64bit microprocessor codenamed Viper Fujitsu provided the initial funding for the project and also agreed to provide Ross Technology with a loan so it could continue operating

The companys stock fell during this period and there were several warnings from NASDAQ in 1997 that the company would be delisted which Ross avoided until 1998 when the companys stock fell below NASDAQ requirements

In April 1998 the company began to consider its financial options including a search for a buyer In May the company warned that a closing of operations was coming and in June 1998 the board of directors decided to begin closing down the company after there were no buyers A new business unit called BridgePoint was formed at this time to manage the existing inventory to meet the requirements of existing customers and to provide support for Ross products Ross Technology closed down in 1998 and all its assets and patents became the property of Fujitsu Ltd

Ross was a significant part of the hardware ecosystem of Suns SPARCbased systems of the time They participated in the design of the MBus architecture and it was Ross Technologys 605based Pinnacle product line that launched Sun servers into the 2x and 4x multiprocessor arena which prior to Ross were confined to single processor server offerings

The hyperSPARC processor developed by Ross viewed first as a competitor to Suns own SPARC processor designs but eventually adopted by Sun and sold both as upgrades and system components It was an emergency engineeringwide Ross hyperSPARC upgrade which enabled Steve Jobs Pixar to complete and deliver their animated movie Toy Story to Disney on schedule after the existing Sun Microsystems machines were overwhelmed in the late product development stage by Pixars demanding new technology

Sancho received his AA degree from Valencia Community College in 1973 He then received his BA in Social Science from Stetson University in 1978 Sancho completed his education with a JD from Florida State University College of Law in 1987

In 1984 Sancho a Democrat was the Leon County leader for Presidential candidate Gary Hart Sancho is a State Certified Supervisor of Elections and nationally certified by the Elections Center as a Certified ElectionsRegistration Administrator CERA Hes a former staff member of the Florida House of Representatives Corrections Probation  Parole Committee He is a member of the Center for Policy Alternatives Voter Participation Advisory Board and member of The Elections Center

After a bid as county commissioner in 1986 Sancho took courses in election machine management and became certified in their use In November 1988 Sancho was elected to his first term as the Supervisor of Elections for Leon County Florida He ran and was reelected in 1992 1996 2000 and 2004 serving his fifth term as of January 2 2005 He was unopposed in each election since 1992

In the 2000 presidential recount Sancho No Party Affiliation was chosen to lead the Florida hand count of ballots in dispute in MiamiDade County The US Supreme Court stopped the hand count in a 72 vote just as it got underway Later the Court ruled 54 that no constitutionally valid recount could be completed by a December 12 safe harbor deadline

Most voters 99 in Leon County use the optiscan equipment but federal law requires one electronic machine per precinct for visually impaired voters

In 2005 Sancho invited Bev Harris founder of Black Box Voting Kathleen Wynne Black Box Voting Associate Director Harri Hursti computer programmer and security expert Dr Hugh Thompson application security expert and PhD in math Susan Bernecker former Republican candidate for New Orleans city council and Susan Pynchon Director of Florida Fair Elections Coalition to Tallahassee There they performed what is now known as the Hursti Hack which became the center piece of an HBO documentary titled Hacking Democracy
As a result Diebold Election Systems  Software and Sequoia Voting Systems the only 3 companies certified to do business in Florida would not sell Sancho voting machines Automark was contacted by Sancho but the Secretary of State would not certify their voting equipment ESS said did not believe it could have a smooth working relationship with Sancho

In Florida Volusia County joined Leon County in dumping Diebold Elections officials in the states of Maryland North Carolina Texas and California have called into question the security and accuracy of new voting machines

After the test election Secretary of State Sue Cobb R accused Sancho of undermining voter confidence and the Federal Government and demanded the return of a 564000 in grant money given to Sancho through the state to purchase voting machines that would comply with ADA standards as mandated in the Help America Vote Act HAVA a United States federal law passed on October 29 2002

At Leon County Commission meetings on February 14 and February 28 2006 the only two Republicans in the local governments of either the city of Tallahassee or Leon County government Tony Grippa and Ed Depuy of Leon Countys sevenmember county commission blasted Sancho for failing to provide Leon County with accessible voting machines in attacks that Sancho believes were politically motivated

At a Leon County Commission meeting on February 28 2006 county staff revealed that Chuck Owen Division Counsel for Diebold Election Systems met with county staff behind closed doors on February 27 According to staff Owen stated that Diebold would sell its touchscreen voting machines to the county if and only if the county removed Supervisor Sancho from office That same day Commissioner DePuy offered a motion seconded by Commissioner Grippa to request the State Attorney to convene a grand jury to investigate why Leon County is not in compliance with the voting regulations

Tony Grippa left the Leon County Commission in April 2006 Ed DePuy was defeated in 2008 by Democrat Akin Akinyemi

On March 8 2006 Sancho initiated legal proceedings against Diebold Election Systems for breach of contract Attorney Lida Rodriguez Taseff with Duane Morris in Miami filed the suit Diebold refused to return phone calls to Sancho and staff refused to honor its existing contract with Leon County for the maintenance and upgrades of its voting system Further Diebold refused to sell Leon County touchscreen voting machines to meet state and federal requirements for disabled accessibility

Sancho has been on National Public Radio and is familiar to readers of the New York Times the Washington Post St Petersburg Times and appears in the 2006 HBO documentary Hacking Democracy

Metronomy is an English electronic music group formed in 1999 The current band consists of Joseph Mount vocals keyboards and guitar Oscar Cash saxophone backing vocals guitars and keyboards Anna Prior drums and vocals and Olugbenga Adelekan bass guitar and vocals Their music consists of vocal and instrumental electronic pop music Mount also releases remixes under the name Metronomy and has remixed many artists including Gorillaz Sebastien Tellier Roots Manuva Franz Ferdinand Klaxons Goldfrapp Young Knives Zero 7 Ladytron Kate Nash Lady Gaga and Lykke Li

Metronomy have released five albums of original material Pip Paine Pay The 5000 You Owe Nights Out The English Riviera Love Letters and Summer 08

As a teenager Joseph Mount began Metronomy as a bedroom project while he was still living with his parents in Devon After having an interest in music from an early age he drummed in a few bands at school and they all fell apart Then I got an old computer off my dad I and started messing around when I was about sixteen or seventeen The name Metronomy was originally chosen by Mount as the name sounded cool and interesting and was in keeping with the bands he was heavily into namely Autechre and Funkstorung The word Metronomy is also linked to a metronome which is a piece of equipment musicians use to help keep and set tempo

In 2002 Mount moved to Brighton for his studies while having a number of odd jobs including one at a local HMV Upon graduating he became interested in music production and began soundtracking animations During his time in Brighton Mount began to get involved with electronic music nights and performed as a DJ At one of these gigs he was approached by some guy who told me hed put out a record It turned out that of the songs Id recorded I had an albums worth

In the autumn of 2005 Metronomy released a debut album Pip Paine Pay the 5000 You Owe preceded by the first single You Could Easily Have Me After it had received limited attention Mount began to build up a reputation for live shows Initially Metronomy was essentially a laptopDJ act although Mount soon asked his cousin Oscar Cash and an old schoolfriend Gabriel Stebbing to join him Mount explained that I was doing some shows on my own  which was pretty crap so I thought it would be better to get a band thing going on

Over the next three years the trio spent gaining liveexperience while Mount recreated mixes for many other artists as contractual issues with the record company halted any new release On remixing Mount has said basically I only like remixers that really care about what theyre doing I can honestly say that I have got really involved in all of my remixes If Ive not got anywhere with one I will tell whoever it is that Im giving up That doesnt happen that often Metronomy has a good strike rate in terms of remix work released However a DFAinspired remix of U2s City of Blinding Lights was dismissed by their marketing manager and was not released

Although the band was now a threepiece live in the studio Mount was still writing and recording it all on my own and influenced by people whove written recorded and produced things all on their own like Prince In 2008 the band released the singles My Heart Rate Rapid Holiday Heartbreaker which feat a Remix by Kris Menace A Thing For Me and Radio Ladio and the full album Nights Out in September of that year Kris Menaces Remix of Heartbreaker became Hype Chart Nr1 in 2008 In May 2009 it was announced through the bands Myspace page that Stebbing would be leaving the band Joseph wrote Its all very amicable and hes assured me he doesnt think hes fleeing a sinking ship
Stebbing is currently working with his own band Your Twenties which is being produced by Mount Despite this Stebbing reappeared to play bass for Metronomy for their appearance at the Far Out stage at Green Man 2010

In 2011 the band released three singles The Look Everything Goes My Way and The Bay from their 3rd album The English Riviera which came out on 11 April

On 23 January 2014 Metronomys upcoming single Love Letters was named Zane Lowes Hottest Record in the World In a telephone interview with the band it was confirmed that the video would be directed by Michel Gondry Their fourth studio album Love Letters was released on 10 March 2014 with the band achieving their highest ever position on the UK Albums Chart at number 7

In an interview with The Crack magazine it was revealed that Metronomy would be releasing a new album in the summer of 2016 The title of the album was later revealed to be Summer 08 with its release scheduled on 1 July 2016

Before Mount started writing music as Metronomy he Gabriel and friend Kevin Hawes who died in 2005 performed and wrote music as part of The Upsides and The Customers

The Upsides were a band that Joseph and Gabriel joined when still in their early teens According to Joseph they played proper original pop songs  we like to think we were the original Busted The band came to an end when both guys moved to Brighton to start university

The Customers started out in 1996 as a studio project for Will and Gregg who lived in a neighbouring village to Josephs and Gabriels home in Devon but did not enter its present form until all members had moved from Devon to Sussex

Will worked with Gabriel and played out live under the guise of Willis The name changed to The Customers on Christmas Day 2001 Joseph joined the band as drummer in 2002 and they welcomed Gregg back into the lineup to complete the four piece

Metronomy have toured widely throughout the UK and Europe supporting acts such as Coldplay Bloc Party CSS Klaxons Kate Nash and Justice They engaged in their first headline UK tour in 2008 Metronomy have also played gigs in America and Canada notably at the 2007 SXSW

Up until April 2009 Joseph Mounts performance of keyboards vocals and guitar in the live band was accompanied by members Oscar Cash keyboards melodica and saxophone and Gabriel Stebbing keyboards and bass guitar Since Stebbings departure from Metronomy in 2009 their live set has been known as Metronomy 20 and has been highly praised by Stebbing

Metronomys new band features former Lightspeed Champion drummer Anna Prior and bassist Olugbenga Adelekan

Metronomys live shows include dance routines and light shows Most notably they use push lights stuck to their chests Mount explained We did our first gig in Brighton and a few days before I saw these lights in a pound shop and I thought well whack these on our tshirts and do some synchronised light shows Im totally aware that some people hate it but equally I think some people enjoy it just for the fact that its a bit of fun

Metronomy performed at Field Day music festival in Sydney Australia on New Years Day 2012 and toured the UK in February 2012 with Two Door Cinema Club Tribes and Azealia Banks on the NME Awards Tour 2012 They also performed at Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona in May 2014 at Rock Werchter in Belgium in June 2014 and at Festival No6 at Portmeirion Wales in September 2015

National Airlines 19341980
National Airlines was a United States airline that operated from 1934 to 1980 For most of its existence the company was headquartered at Miami International Airport Florida At its height National Airlines had a network of CoasttoCoasttoCoast flights linking Florida and the Gulf Coast with cities along the East Coast and large cities on the West Coast From 1970 to 1978 National Pan American World Airways Pan Am and Trans World Airlines TWA were the only US airlines that operated scheduled passenger flights to Europe

National Airlines was founded by George T Baker 18991963 in 1934 Its headquarters were in St Petersburg Florida and it was based at the citys Albert Whitted Airport On October 15 of that year revenue flights were launched transporting passengers and mail from St Petersburg to a few destinations within Florida using a fleet of two Ryan ST monoplanes In 1935 the Stinson Trimotor was introduced with National Airlines which were soon replaced by the Lockheed Model 10 Electra In 1939 the company headquarters were moved to Jacksonville By the end of the decade the National Airlines network spanned from Miami to New Orleans on what it called the Buccaneer Route

Revenue passenger miles for years ending June 30

In 1940 the Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar became the backbone of Nationals fleet National was awarded rights from Florida to New York City and other cities along the East Coast in 1944 with flights starting in 1945 In 1946 National got approval to fly to Havana Cuba which coincided with the introduction of the Douglas DC4 The DC4 allowed nonstop flights between Miami and New York that started on February 14 1946 Later that year National relocated its headquarters to Miami International Airport a maintenance base opened at Miami in 1950

The Douglas DC6 Nationals first pressurized airliner began flights on July 1 1947 and reduced New York to Miami flight time from five to four hours Flights on the DC6 were marketed as Star Service National ran the Piggy Bank Vacations campaign promoting lowfare flights to Florida during the offpeak summer season

This decade saw the introduction of the Convair 340440 the Douglas DC7 and the Lockheed L1049 Super Constellation On December 10 1958 National became the first airline to operate domestic jet flights using a Boeing 707 leased from Pan American World Airways between Miami and New York In 1959 the Lockheed L188 Electra was introduced into the fleet It was the only turboprop aircraft type ever operated by the airline At the end of the decade Houston and Boston were the ends of the network with heavy emphasis on service between Florida and the US East Coast and Gulf Coast

With the award of traffic rights on the southern transcontinental route on March 11 1961 National Airlines gained access to California and began operating new Douglas DC8 jetliners between Florida and Los Angeles and San Francisco with a number of flights making intermediate stops in Houston andor New Orleans previously American Airlines Delta Air Lines and National had together operated Douglas DC6 and DC7 propliner aircraft with interchange throughservice between Miami and California In March 1962 National was operating only one round trip transcontinental nonstop service National flight numbers 34 and 35 between Miami and Los Angeles which were both flown with DC8 jets According to the front cover of its system timetable at the time National billed itself as the Airline of the Stars Concerning international destinations in Central and South America a cooperation involving interchange flights with Pan Am was set up

Also during the early 1960s National inaugurated new service with the Lockheed Electra propjet to Las Vegas and San Diego Eastbound coast to coast routes flown with the Electra at this time included San DiegoLos AngelesHoustonNew OrleansMiami and San FranciscoLas VegasHoustonNew OrleansTampaOrlandoJacksonville National was also operating other long multistop routings with the Electra as this time such as BostonNew York CityJacksonvilleOrlandoTampaNew OrleansHoustonLas VegasSan Francisco National flight number 223 departed Boston at 730am and arrived in San Francisco at 842pm with this latter routing being flown on a daily basis Total travel time for this flight was 16 hours and 12 minutes

In 1962 Louis Bergman Bud Maytag Jr grandson of Maytag Corporation founder Frederick Louis Maytag I who had previously led Frontier Airlines bought a majority share in National Airlines and replaced George T Baker as CEO In 1960 the airline modernized its fleet with new Douglas DC8 jetliners which were then followed by ten new Boeing 727100 trijets the first of which was delivered in 1964 

After the retirement of the Electras in 1968 National became an alljet airline with the DC8 and 727 The airline introduced the first jet service into Key West FL in 1968 with the Boeing 727100 The Douglas DC8 fleet included the stretched Super DC861 which was the largest aircraft type operated by the airline until the introduction of new wide body jetliners such as the Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC10 In 1969 National was operating the Super DC8 nonstop between Miami and New York JFK airport and also nonstop between Miami and Los Angeles with these flights having specific names such as The Royal Biscayne The Royal Dolphin The Gotham and The Manhattan between Miami and New York and The Californian and The Caribbean between Miami and Los Angeles

On July 26 1969 the AtlantaSan Francisco nonstop route was awarded to National and service began on October 1 1969 It was Nationals only route out of Atlanta

A 17 million IBM electronic computer reservation system called ResAVision was completed and put into operation in 1970

On June 16 1970 National Airlines reintroduced international flights when their MiamiLondon route opened flights to Cuba were suspended in 1961 due to the Cuban Revolution With the London route they became the third US transatlantic passenger carrier after Pan Am and TWA

In October the Boeing 747100 jumbo jet at that time the largest commercial airliner entered service with National on the MiamiNew York nonstop route on October 1 1970 and the MiamiLos Angeles transcontinental nonstop route on October 25 1970 National sold its 747s in May 1976 Also in 1970 National Airlines opened their own terminal at John F Kennedy International Airport which was dubbed the Sundrome

Having placed an order for ten aircraft back in 1969 the wide body McDonnell Douglas DC1010 was put in service on the MiamiNew York route on December 15 1971 A 1971 publicity campaign designed by F William Free promoting Nationals flight attendants was criticized by the National Organization for Women as being sexist due to the slogan Im flight attendants name Fly me or similar Seeing one of these posters in Manchester inspired Eric Stewart of 10cc to write the bands 1976 song Im Mandy Fly Me

In May 1973 the front cover of the airlines system timetable proudly proclaimed National has daily nonstop 747s from Miami to London By early 1976 the airline was operating scheduled wide body DC10 service to Houston IAH Las Vegas LAS Los Angeles LAX Miami MIA New Orleans MSY Orlando MCO San Diego SAN San Francisco SFO Tampa TPA West Palm Beach PBI and all three airports in the New York City area John F Kennedy JFK LaGuardia LGA and Newark EWR With the advent of the intercontinental McDonnell Douglas DC1030 National Airlines then expanded their European network by adding Paris inaugurated on June 22 1977 as well as Frankfurt Amsterdam both in 1978 and Zurich in 1979 National began the very first nonstop flights from New Orleans to Europe to Amsterdam on July 2 1978 National then began nonstop New York Kennedy JFKAmsterdam flights on December 13 1978 taking the route over from Pan Am

In 1975 National was forced to shut down for several months due to a strike by flight attendants

In the late 1970s several airlines tried to take over National Airlines who had become a major player in the southern transcontinental and FloridaEast Coast airline markets In 1978 Texas International Airlines which was led by Frank Lorenzo at that time acquired 246 percent of the shares but did not succeed in the subsequent tender offer takeover bid A similar attempt was made by Eastern Air Lines in 1979 At the same time the shares held by Texas International were sold to Pan American World Airways who emerged as a white knight and succeeded in accumulating a controlling majority 

On January 7 1980 the acquisition of National was completed with Pan Am taking over the National Airlines fleet and route network Pan Am continued to utilize the former National Miami maintenance base and headquarters building until Pan Am itself ceased operations in December 1991 Much later Nationals Sun King logo was sold and repackaged much like Pan Ams to appear upon the branding of start up low cost carrier Southeast Airlines aircraft 

Most industry analysts believe that Pan Am paid too high a price for National and was ill prepared to integrate Nationals domestic route network with Pan Ams own globegirdling international network The cultures of National and Pan Am also proved to be incompatible making workforce integration difficult Texas International walked away from their foiled attempt with a multimillion dollar stock profit and was poised for Lorenzos next venturesa startup airline in the highdensity East coast corridor New York Air and subsequent acquisition of Continental Airlines

National Airlines operated scheduled flights to the following US cities
National also operated scheduled flights to the following destinations in Europe and the Caribbean

When National Airlines was acquired by Pan Am in 1980 the fleet consisted of 43 Boeing 727 aircraft 19 of the original series 100 model and 24 of the stretched series 200 variant as well as 16 McDonnell Douglas DC10 airliners 11 of the series 10 model used in domestic service and five of the intercontinental series 30 model used for service to Europe

Over the years National owned the following aircraft types






Between 1961 and 1980 22 attempted hijackings on board National Airlines occurred which involved the aircraft being demanded to be flown to Cuba In 1969 alone there were nine such occurrences These events can be partly attributed to the tense CubaUnited States relations at that time and the many flights of National Airlines in and to the southeastern United States near Cuba See List of Cuba United States aircraft hijackings for more information

There were several other criminal acts involving National Airlines aircraft

Ionic polymermetal composites
Ionic polymermetal composites IPMCs are synthetic composite nanomaterials that display artificial muscle behavior under an applied voltage or electric field IPMCs are composed of an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically plated or physically coated with conductors such as platinum or gold Under an applied voltage 15 V for typical 10mmx40mmx02mm samples ion migration and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a bending deformation If the plated electrodes are arranged in a nonsymmetric configuration the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting rolling torsioning turningtwirling whirling and nonsymmetric bending deformation Alternatively if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal few millivolts for typical small samples as sensors and energy harvesters IPMCs are a type of electroactive polymer They work very well in a liquid environment as well as in air They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode IPMCs in actuationsensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor BarCohen Xue Simpson and Smith see references below but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 199293 by Adolf Shahinpoor Segalman Witkowski Osada Okuzaki Hori Doi Matsumoto Hirose Oguro Takenaka Asaka and Kawami as depicted below

<doc id="7716808" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7716808" title="HTTP persistent connection">
HTTP persistent connection
HTTP persistent connection also called HTTP keepalive or HTTP connection reuse is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requestsresponses as opposed to opening a new connection for every single requestresponse pair The newer HTTP2 protocol uses the same idea and takes it further to allow multiple concurrent requestsresponses to be multiplexed over a single connection

Under HTTP 10 connections are not considered persistent unless a keepalive header is included although there is no official specification for how keepalive operates It was in essence added to an existing protocol If the client supports keepalive it adds an additional header to the request

Then when the server receives this request and generates a response it also adds a header to the response

Following this the connection is not dropped but is instead kept open When the client sends another request it uses the same connection This will continue until either the client or the server decides that the conversation is over and one of them drops the connection

In HTTP 11 all connections are considered persistent unless declared otherwise The HTTP persistent connections do not use separate keepalive messages they just allow multiple requests to use a single connection However the default connection timeout of Apache httpd 13 and 20 is as little as 15 seconds and just 5 seconds for Apache httpd 22 and above The advantage of a short timeout is the ability to deliver multiple components of a web page quickly while not consuming resources to run multiple server processes or threads for too long

Keepalive makes it difficult for the client to determine where one response ends and the next response begins particularly during pipelined HTTP operation This is a serious problem when codice1 cannot be used due to streaming To solve this problem HTTP 11 introduced a chunked transfer coding that defines a codice2 bit The codice2 bit is set at the end of each response so that the client knows where the next response begins


According to RFC 7230 section 64 a client ought to limit the number of simultaneous open connections that it maintains to a given server The previous version of the HTTP11 specification stated specific maximum values but in the words of RFC 7230 this was found to be impractical for many applications instead be conservative when opening multiple connections These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response times and avoid congestion If HTTP pipelining is correctly implemented there is no performance benefit to be gained from additional connections while additional connections may cause issues with congestion

If the client does not close the connection when all of the data it needs has been received the resources needed to keep the connection open on the server will be unavailable for other clients How much this affects the servers availability and how long the resources are unavailable depend on the servers architecture and configuration

All modern web browsers including Google Chrome Firefox Internet Explorer since 401 Opera since 40 and Safari use persistent connections

By default Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 use two persistent connections while version 8 uses six Persistent connections time out after 60 seconds of inactivity which is changeable via the Windows Registry

In Firefox the number of simultaneous connections can be customized perserver perproxy total Persistent connections time out after 115seconds 192minutes of inactivity which is changeable via the configuration

The Hummer
The Hummer is the ninth solo album by Canadian musician Devin Townsend and his second ambient album It was released on Townsends label HevyDevy Records on November 15 2006

The album chiefly consists of interwoven low frequency sounds flute morse code and ocean sounds as well as audio samples from sources such as a reading by Leonard Cohen of part of the Tibetan Book of the Dead Ravi Shankar and the science fiction film Contact 1997 This is a quiet reflective work in the vein of meditative music and provides a stark antithesis to the aggressive heavy metal stance adopted by one of Townsends other projects  Strapping Young Lad Townsend describes it as much more user friendly than the Devlabstill some people are going to think its just buzzing and humming noises so againits not for everybody

National Airlines 19992002
National Airlines was a Las Vegas based low fare airline that operated from 1999 to 2002 It was the third United Statesbased airline to use the name The airline was created to bring tourists to Las Vegas National offered service to a limited number of cities with high traffic to Las Vegas The airline operated a fleet of 19 Boeing 757200s in a twoclass configuration

Hoping to attract more visitors from the East Coast Harrahs Entertainment and the former Rio Hotel  Casino Inc each contributed 15 million toward the startup costs of National Airlines in July 1998 Wexford Capital owners of Republic Airways Holdings also contributed several million to this create the airline

Taking a page from Southwest Airlines book National kept things simple by operating a single aircraft type  in Nationals case the Boeing 757

Service began on May 27 1999 This was the third airline in the United States to use the National Airlines name Michael Conway became President and CEO of the company From its inception the company fought an uphill battle against rising fuel costs and an economic recession National Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 6 2000

Like many other airlines National had serious financial problems after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and only 41 months after their inaugural flight left Las Vegas McCarran International Airport the airline ceased all operations on November 6 2002 after being in Chapter 11 bankruptcy for 23 months

As of the day of Nationals grounding on November 6 2002 the airline had carried 185 million passengers through McCarran January  November 2002 and National was the airports fourthlargest carrier based upon passenger volume Departing McCarran International Airport at 420 pm National Airlines Flight 354 to DallasFort Worth was the carriers last to leave the Las Vegas hub

At the time National Airlines was grounded the airline provided service to 14 destinations throughout the United States

Novell BorderManager
BorderManager is a multi purpose network security application developed by Novell Inc BorderManager is designed as a proxy server firewall and VPN access point Novell has announced that migration to SuperLumin 40 Proxy Cache is Novells preferred firewall and proxy solution for NetWare customers upgrading to Novell Open Enterprise Server on Linux

BorderManager was designed to run on top of the NetWare kernel and takes advantage of the fast file services that the NetWare kernel delivers Aside from the more easily copied firewall and VPN access point services Novell designed the proxy services to retrieve web data with a server to server connection rather than a client to server connection as all of the prior proxy servers on the market had done This retrieval method along with NetWares fast file IO and other proprietary code made BorderManagers proxy engine one of the fastest in existence

In 2003 Novell announced the successor product to NetWare Open Enterprise Server OES First released in March 2005 OES completes the separation of the services traditionally associated with NetWare ie file and print This makes it possible for the customer to choose which NetWare or Linux kernel the services will run on

At this time Novell all but announced the end of development for the NetWare kernel numerous public and private statements that there is no 64bit future for NetWare and that Linux is the path to 64bit computing for OES To follow through on this migration path Novell began porting all applications to Linux The company began looking at alternate ways to deliver these same services as firewall and VPN access point services of equivalent functionality are readily available in the freeopensource community and there are also basic proxy services as well ie Squid The desire to deliver a functional equivalent could not be done by a full software code port as much of the cache engine was sold as part of the Volera Excelerator and Novell holds a great desire to use or create opensource software for basic services such as this

Novell entered an agreement with Astaro to relabel Astaro Security Gateway and license it as Novell Security Manager The product was removed from the Novell price list on 15 February 2007

In the late summer of 2006 Novell announced that there would be a BorderManager 39 release

At the Novell BrainShare conference in 2010 Novell announced SuperLumin 40 Proxy Cache as path forward for BorderManager customers They also announced extended BorderManager General Support for two years through March 7 2012 to give customers adequate time to make the move

As of November 2011 the Novell Support Lifecycle page states that Border Manager 39 General Support will be extended to September 30 2013 to make it easy for customers to plan and execute their upgrade to Novell Open Enterprise Server The upgrade path for Border Manager remains SuperLumin Nemesis

Croats of Slovenia
The Croats are an ethnic group in Slovenia In the 2002 census 35642 citizens of Slovenia identified themselves as Croats

Croats have lived in the Slovene Lands for centuries Most Croats and Slovenes were for centuries part of the same political entities first the Habsburg Empire and then Yugoslavia The number of Croats in the territory of modern Slovenia remained relatively small as the Slovene lands before the 1950s experienced more emigration than immigration During most of the history Croats did not constitute a separate community and many were assimilated by the Slovene German or Venetianspeaking populations After World War I the number of Croats in Slovenia increased significantly and more numerous communities were present in Ljubljana Maribor and Celje In the 1960s the number of Croats increased significantly again as the result of a wave of relocation from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina

Unlike two other historic autochthonous minorities of Slovenia the Hungarians and Italians the Croats have not been granted minority status although they are the second largest ethnic minority in Slovenia after the Serbs also not granted minority status According to the Slovenian constitutional framework only historical minorities who have been living on clearly defined territories for centuries and the Romani people who have formed a distinct community since at least the 13th century can have the status of a minority This would carry several constitutionally guaranteed rights such as visible bilingualism and an autonomous educational system All remaining minority members are guaranteed the right to express and develop freely their cultural and linguistic heritage under the same laws applying to citizens in general but lack the positive discrimination policies applied to the three constitutionally recognized minority communities as well as the right to have statesponsored schools in their languages

In 2006 the Croatian Heritage Foundation along with the Federation of Croatian Societies of Slovenia organized the Week of Slovenian Croats in Zagreb as part of the heritage foundations annual Croatian minority week

The number of Slovenian citizens of Croatian origin is difficult to establish According to the 2001 census 35642 of them declared themselves as ethnically nationally according to the Slovenian terminology Croatian In the same census around 54000 people declared Croatian as their mother tongue Ten years earlier more than 52000 Slovenian citizens declared themselves as ethnically Croatian while the number of those with Croatian as their mother tongue was around 50000

It seems however that the great majority of Croats living in Slovenia uses Slovene as their primary language of communication
In 2001 only around 2700 people spoke either Croatian or a combination of Croatian and Slovene at home which is a significant decrease from in 1991 when their number was around 10000

Express Media is an Australian notforprofit youth arts organisation founded in 1985 Originally called Express Australia the organisation is currently listed on the Register of Cultural Organisations It presents an annual program of special events workshops awards and artistic projects throughout the year to generate opportunities for young and emerging artists The flagship publication is Voiceworks In 2005 John Marsden writer became and remains the principal patron of Express Media supporting an annual prize encouraging creative literary work by young people 

In 1988 Express Media began publishing a newsletter both to promote the organisations program of workshops and as a forum for youth and media issues The newsletter was called Voiceworks and it was launched by then Prime Minister Bob Hawke and music journalist Ian Molly Meldrum In the 90s Voiceworks grew into a quarterly magazine expanding its content to include poetry short fiction articles opinion and illustration contributed by under 25s Prominent alumni such as Benjamin Law Liam Pieper Anna Krien Hannah Kent Tom Doig Lili Wilkinson Justin Heazlewood and Van Badham have gone on to have a significant impact in the Australian literary artistic and political landscapes The magazine has remained in print form and has continued to develop into a wellrespected and sophisticated literary journal In 2015 Voiceworks celebrated its 100th issue

In response to the need for development opportunities and professional pathways for arts and cultural critics 1997 saw the launch of Express Medias Buzzcuts program In partnership with literary and arts festivals around the country the program was developed in order to give young journalists experience working with an editor publication opportunities and exposure to the world of professional arts reviewing and cultural criticism

Following the success of Express Medias Make It Up Zine Fair and in response to the burgeoning youth and emerging literary scene in Melbourne in 2004 Express Media held a twoday series of panels readings performances and workshops featuring the best Australian writers you havent heard of yet This event was the inaugural Emerging Writers Festival While the festival found a strong audience and independence the two organisations continue to have strong ties and Express Media alumni as well as young writers engaged in our programs feature heavily within the festival each year

In 2005 John Marsden became and remains the principal patron of Express Media supporting an annual prize encouraging creative literary work by young people The patronage of an immensely popular and internationally recognised author has been invaluable in assisting Express Media to encourage and develop the creative skills of young writers by significantly extending the reach and impact of our programs

Culbert
Culbert is a personal name that seems to have originated in Europe The earliest records for this surname are found in England Scotland and Ireland The use of surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation In England heritable surnames started to form in the 11th century and were common in most areas by 1400 The Poll Tax introduced in England in the 14th Century considered a head tax is probably the first time this common usage of surnames was documented
A specific origin for this name is not known however it does not appear to be derived from a place nor from an occupation two common sources for peoples names

The following references suggest that Culbert may be derived from other names that describe a persons character For example Culbert may stem from Culbheart which is a Gaelic form meaning crafty However Culbert is not a Gaelic name and connecting the Culberts to early Ireland has been unsuccessful as no records have been found before the 18th Century with the earliest found being from 1749 It is possible the earliest Culberts in Ireland came there from Scotland and England as a result of the creation of the Plantations of Ulster in the early 1600s

Also crafty is related to wisdom and this suggests a possible connection with the surname Cuthbert a name from the Anglo Saxon which means famous bright of clear skill or knowledge It is also believed by some researchers that Culbert is derived from Cutbert This earlier spelling is very similar to Cuthbert and Cuthbertson one reason for the close relationship between these surnames The surname is also closely related to Culbertson and Culberson which mean son of Culbert

With regards to claims of origin MacLysaght states that the surname Culbert is of Huguenot origin and is found mainly in Irelands northern province of Ulster However no record has yet been found to document that any Culbert was a Huguenot or a Huguenot descendant

In Scotland Culbert is considered a variant of Colbert derived from the AngloSaxon CeolberhtCeolbeorht in Old English ceol  ship and berhtbeorht  bright They suggest Culbert is a personal name dating from the 700s in England however no actual records have been found in England for another 850 years

Also for England one heraldryrelate website claims that Culbert is one of the names of people who migrated there from Normandy following the Norman Conquest and that Culbert has been found in the Counties of Cheshire and Lancashire Unfortunately these records also have not been uncovered The earliest Culbert found in FamilySearch records for Cheshire is William Culbert b bef 1706 and for Lancashire is Thomas Culbert b bef 1764 The oldest Culbert record found to date anywhere is for Mutton Culbert who married Alice Legge on 27 Mar 1554 at St Nicholas Ipswich Suffolk England

The earliest home of a Culbertson son of Culbert so far found is located in the County of Roxburg Scotland at a small village named Morebattle eight miles south of Kelso Here Culbertson people have reportedly lived continuously since the year 1400 AD This is in the Lowlands and is about five miles from the Cheviot Hills which form the boundary between Scotland and England

As migrations from Europe became more common in the 19th and 20th Centuries Culbert people have spread from Europe and have now become more predominant in the United States Canada Australia and New Zealand For example in the 1881 Census of the United Kingdom including England Scotland Wales and Ireland 91 Culbert individuals were indexed compared to 256 individuals in the 1881 Canada Census and compared to 620 individuals in the 1880 US Federal Census

In 2000 the surname Culbert was ranked 12650 in terms of the most common surnames in the United States with 2244 occurrences in the 2000 US Federal Census The racialethnic breakdown included nearly 77 percent White almost 20 percent Black a little more than 2 percent Hispanic about 1 percent NonHispanic of two or more races and minor amounts less than 1 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander or American Indian and Alaskan Native

An extract of an Office of National Statistics database containing a list of surnames in use in England Wales and the Isle of Mann in September 2002 suggests that Culbert was ranked 13686 with 389 occurrences

Culbert is used as both a given name and as a surname as in the following examples of persons

Leon  Lion was an which served in the Royal Hellenic Navy from 19121941

The ship along with her three sister ships  and  had originally been ordered by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead Leon was originally named Tucumn They were purchased in 1912 by Greece ready for delivery each for the sum of 148000 when the Balkan Wars seemed likely

During the Balkan Wars the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition 3000 rounds Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship and for this reason these ships were initially named scouts rather than destroyers Leon was in action during the Balkan Wars under Lieutenant Commander J Razikotsikas also on board was Squadron Commander Lieutenant Commander D Papachristos

During World War I Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and due to Greeces neutrality the four Aetosclass ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916 taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 191718 By 1918 they were back on escort duty under Greek colors and was in action blockading the coasts of the Black Sea from Bosphorus up to Trebizond

On 22 December 1921 while moored with Ierax in Piraeus harbour they were both severely damaged by the explosion of a depth charge which the crew of Leon was transporting Two officers one petty officer and two sailors were killed on Leon and two sailors on Ierax Leon completely lost her aft section up to her stern gun

After the war Leon was refurbished from 19251927 She also participated in the Second World War On 18 April 1941 during a convoy escort she collided with the passenger ship followed by the explosion of two depth charges As a result her stern section was cut off and two officers were killed She was finally sunk by German bombers on 15 May 1941 in Souda Bay Crete where she had been towed from Salamis Naval Base

Lisa BrennanJobs
Lisa Nicole BrennanJobs ne Brennan May 17 1978 is an American writer She is the daughter of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan For several years Jobs denied paternity which led to a legal case and various media reports in the early days of Apple Lisa and Steve Jobs eventually reconciled and he accepted her paternity BrennanJobs later worked as a journalist and magazine writer

An early Apple computer the Apple Lisa is named after BrennanJobs and she has been depicted in a number of biographies and films including the biopics Pirates of Silicon Valley Jobs and Steve Jobs A fictionalized version of her is a major character in her aunt Mona Simpsons novel A Regular Guy

Lisa Nicole Brennan was born on May 17 1978 on Robert Friedlands All One Farm commune outside of Portland Oregon Her mother Chrisann Brennan and her father Steve Jobs first met at Homestead High School in Cupertino California in 1972 and had an onoff relationship for the next five years In 1977 after Jobs had cofounded Apple Inc he and Brennan moved into a house with their friend Daniel Kottke near the companys office in Cupertino where they all worked It was during this period that Brennan became pregnant with Lisa Jobs however did not assume responsibility for the pregnancy which led Brennan to end the relationship leave their shared home and support herself by cleaning houses

In 1978 Brennan moved to the All One Farm commune to have the baby Jobs was not present for the babys birth and only came up three days later after Robert Friedland the farms owner and a friend of Jobs from Reed College persuaded him to do so Brennan and Jobs named the baby Lisa Jobs named the computer project he was working on the Apple Lisa after her Shortly after Jobs publicly denied that he was the childs father He claimed that the Apple Lisa was not named for her and had his team come up with the phrase Local Integrated Systems Architecture as an alternative explanation for the projects name Decades later Jobs admitted that obviously it was named for my daughter

After Lisa was born Jobs publicly denied paternity which led to a legal case Even after a DNA paternity test established him as her father he maintained his position The resolution of the legal case required him to provide Brennan with 385 per month and to reimburse the state for the money she had received from welfare After Apple went public and Jobs became a multimillionaire he increased the payment to 500 a month Michael Moritz interviewed Jobs Brennan and a number of others for the 1982 Time Person of the Year special issue released on January 3 1983 In his interview Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test which had found that the probability of paternity for Jobs Steven is 941 Jobs responded by arguing that 28 of the male population of the United States could be the father Rather than name him Person of the Year as he and many others expected while giving the interviews the issue was instead titled Machine of the Year The Computer Moves In The thematic change occurred after Moritz heard about BrennanJobs as well as Jobss management style

Years later after Jobs left Apple he acknowledged Lisa and attempted to reconcile with her Chrisann Brennan wrote that he apologized many times over for his behavior to her and Lisa and said that he never took responsibility when he should have and that he was sorry After reconciling with her nineyearold Lisa wanted to change her last name and Jobs was happy and relieved to agree to it Jobs legally altered her birth certificate changing her name from Lisa Brennan to Lisa BrennanJobs Brennan credits the change in Jobs to the influence of BrennanJobs newly found biological aunt author Mona Simpson who worked to repair the relationship between BrennanJobs and her father

According to Fortune magazine in his will Jobs left Lisa a multimilliondollar inheritance

When BrennanJobs was living with her mother she attended The Nueva School and Lick Wilmerding High School Later after she moved in with her father she attended Palo Alto High School She enrolled at Harvard University in 1996 and studied overseas for one year at Kings College London While a student at Harvard she wrote for The Harvard Crimson She graduated in 2000 and subsequently moved to Manhattan to work as a writer She has written for The Southwest Review The Massachusetts Review The Harvard Advocate Spiked Vogue and O The Oprah Magazine

In March 2018 BrennanJobs announced that she was writing Small Fry a memoir detailing her childhood and the complex and sometimes difficult relationship she had with her father The book was published on September 4 2018

BrennanJobs has featured in several biographies of her father including Walter Isaacsons 2011 authorized biography Steve Jobs Mona Simpsons 1996 novel A Regular Guy is a fictionalized account based on the story of BrennanJobs and her parents She has been depicted in three biopic films Brooke Radding portrayed her in the 1999 TNT TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley while she is played as a child by Ava Acres and as an adult by Annika Bertea in the 2013 film Jobs In the 2015 film Steve Jobs directed by Danny Boyle BrennanJobs is portrayed at different ages by Perla HaneyJardine Ripley Sobo and Makenzie Moss Steve Jobs screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said that he discussed the screenplay with BrennanJobs in advance and that she is the heroine of the film

BrennanJobs resides in Brooklyn with her husband Bill their son and her two stepdaughters

Acoustical measurements and instrumentation
Analysis of sound and acoustics plays a role in such engineering tasks as product design production test machine performance and process control For instance product design can require modification of sound level or noise for compliance with standards from ANSI IEC and ISO The work might also involve design finetuning to meet market expectations Here examples include tweaking an automobile door latching mechanism to impress a consumer with a satisfying click or modifying an exhaust manifold to change the tone of an engines rumble Aircraft designers are also using acoustic instrumentation to reduce the noise generated on takeoff and landing

Acoustical measurements and instrumentation range from a handheld sound level meter to a 1000microphone phased array 

Most of the acoustical measurement and instrumentation systems can be broken down into three components sensors data acquisition and analysis

The most common sensor used for acoustic measurement is the microphone Measurementgrade microphones are different from typical recordingstudio microphones because they can provide a detailed calibration for their response and sensitivity Other sensors include hydrophones for measuring sound in water or accelerometers for measuring vibrations causing sound The three main groups of microphones are pressure freefield and randomincidence each with their own correction factors for different applications Wellknown microphone suppliers include PCB Piezotronics Brel  Kjr GRAS and Audio Precision

Data acquisition hardware for acoustic measurements typically utilizes 24bit analogtodigital converters ADCs antialiasing filters and other signal conditioning This signal conditioning may include amplification filtering sensor excitation and input configuration Another consideration is the frequency range of the instrumentation It should be large enough to cover the frequency range of signal interest taking into account the range of the sensor To prevent aliasing many devices come with antialiasing filters which cut the maximum frequency range of the device to a little less than onehalf the maximum sampling rate as prescribed by the Nyquist sampling theorem Dynamic range is a common way to compare performance from one instrument to another Dynamic range is a measure of how small you can measure a signal relative to the maximum input signal the device can measure Expressed in decibels the dynamic range is 20 log VmaxVmin For example a device with an input range of 10 V and a dynamic range of 110dB will be able to measure a signal as small as 10 V Thus the input range and the specified dynamic range are important for determining the needs of your instrumentation system

Audio and acoustic analysis includes fractionaloctave analysis soundlevel measurements power spectra frequency response measurements and transient analysis Results are viewed on waterfall displays colormap displays and octave graphs

Polyura
Polyura is a subgenus of butterflies also referred to as Nawab butterflies and belonging to the brushfooted butterfly subfamily Charaxinae or leafwing butterflies Like the large and conspicuous forest queens subgenus Euxanthe they belong to the genus Charaxes unique genus of the tribe Charaxini

Polyura butterflies are native to the Indomalaya and Australasian ecozones They are widespread from Pakistan to Okinawa Island and from China to Pacific Islands Fiji New Caledonia Vanuatu


The subgenus was revised in 1982 by Robert Leslie Smiles based on morphological characters

The genus Polyura was synonymized with the genus Charaxes in 2009 in a study investigating phylogenetic relationships among Charaxini using DNA sequencing However the genus Charaxes comprises many morphologically very different groups such as the subgenera Euxanthe and Polyura A phylogenomic study is ongoing to resolve the phylogenetic placements of these different groups The sistergroup to Polyura seems to comprise the African species Charaxes paphianus and Charaxes pleione Southeast Asian species of the genus Charaxes do not seem to be closely related to species of the subgenus Polyura

A comprehensive molecular phylogeny of the subgenus as well as several taxonomic studies have allowed a complete revision of the group A followup study investigating the biogeographical history of the subgenus suggested an origin in the Miocene about 12 million years ago in mainland Asia The Australasian region was colonized later through dispersal

The subgenus is divided in three morphological groups supported by molecular phylogenetics

P athamas group


P eudamippus group

P pyrrhus group

HuntLenox Globe
The HuntLenox Globe or Lenox Globe dating from ca 1510 is the second or thirdoldest known terrestrial globe after the Erdapfel of 1492 It is housed by the Rare Book Division of the New York Public Library

It is notable as one of only two known instances of a historical map actually using the phrase HC SVNT DRACONES in Latin hic sunt dracones means here are dragons

The Lenox Globe is a hollow copper globe that measures in diameter and in circumference It is two parts joined at the equator and held together by a wire strung through holes at the poles

It bears a striking resemblance to the Globus Jagellonicus also tentatively dated to 1510

The phrase HIC SVNT DRACONES appears on the eastern coast of Asia

The globes origins were unknown until 2013 It was purchased in Paris in 1855 by architect Richard Morris Hunt who gave it to James Lenox whose collection became part of the New York Public Library where the globe still resides

In his recollections Henry Stevens recalled seeing the globe while dining with Mr Hunt in 1870 Hunt was ambivalent about the globe which he bought for a song and was allowing his children to toy with it Stevens recognized its value and urged Hunt to store it in the Lenox Library which he was designing at the time Stevens also borrowed the globe to ascertain its age with the help of Julius Erasmus Hilgard who worked for the Coast Surveya predecessor to the US National Geodetic Survey

A similar grapefruitsized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504 It may be the oldest globe to show the New World Stefaan Missinne who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal Portolan said it was part of an important European collection for decades After a year of research in which he consulted many experts Missine concluded the HuntLenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe

The earliest known article on the globe was written by B F de Costa for the Magazine of American History in September 1879 Gabriel Gravier reprinted the article with additional comments in the Bulletin de la socit normande de gographie later that year

However neither article links hic sunt dracones to dragons Da Costa writes
In this region China called East India on the globe near the equatorial line is seen Hc Svnt Dracones or here are the Dagroians described by Marco Polo as living in the Kingdom of Dagroian These people feasted upon the dead and picked their bones BII c14 Ramusios ed
In his translation of Da Costas article Gabriel Gravier adds that Marco Polos Kingdom of Dagroian is in Java Minor or Sumatra well away from the spot indicated on the Lenox Globe

The flat drawing of the globe which accompanied the early articles is reproduced as map 7 in Emerson D Fite and Archibald Freemans A Book of Old Maps Delineating American History New York Dover Reprints 1969 and as figure 43 in A E Nordenskilds FacsimileAtlas to the Early History of Cartography New York Dover Reprints 1973

A photograph of the globe itself can be found on page 81 of Ena L Yonges A Catalogue of Early Globes Made Prior to 1850 and Conserved in the United States New York American Geographical Society 1968 however the side with the inscription faces away from the camera

Teardrops from My Eyes
Teardrops from My Eyes written by Rudy Toombs was the first upbeat major hit for Ruth Brown establishing her as an important figure in rhythm and blues Recorded for Atlantic Records in New York City in September 1950 and released in October it was Billboards numberone RB hit for 11 nonconsecutive weeks It was Atlantics first release on the new 45rpm record format The huge hit earned Brown the nickname Miss Rhythm and within a few months she became the acknowledged queen of RB Teardrops from My Eyes was her first of five numberone RB hits

Before this hit single Ruth Brown was thought of strictly as a torch singer When Ruby Toombs showed her the song Brown was initially reluctant to do it as it was so rhythmically different from the popular standards and ballads she was comfortable singing The change of tempo the backbeat of fourfour at first led her to dig in her heels But Ahmet Ertegn sensing the time was right urged her to give the song a try and so she went along with his choice of tunes for her The song featured a tenor solo by Budd Johnson

Atlantic used a process that it would repeat over the years that is turning an uptown singer funky As with Ruth Brown Ahmet Ertegns method was to introduce popular black musical artists to older and more powerful black musical modes

Armenians in Myanmar
The first Armenians in Burma arrived in 1612 and dwelt in Syriam the first tombstone being dated 1725 They were merchants

Armenians were deported in large numbers to New Julfa on the outskirts of Isfahan Persia early in the seventeenth century Many continued on to India and Southeast Asia in the eighteenth century as conditions turned against them in Persia By the 19th century they were to be found chiefly in Burma the Malay peninsula particularly Penang and Malacca and Java They tended to emigrate further from around World War I notably to Australia

In Burma major Armenian traders were employed as officials by the Burmese kings especially in charge of customs and relations with foreigners They survived the First Burmese War in 1826 when the British annexed Arakan and Tenasserim but the British conquest of Lower Burma the commercial heart of the country in 1852 led to renewed accusations from the British that Armenian merchants were antiBritish and even proRussian Nevertheless the Armenians of Yangon built their church in 1862 on land presented to them by the King of Burma

The 18711872 Census of British India revealed that there were 1250 Armenians chiefly in Kolkata Dhaka and Yangon The 1881 Census stated the figure to be 1308 737 in Bengal and 466 in Burma By 1891 the total figure was 1295The 1901 Census of British India stated that there were 256 Armenians in Burma

The Armenian Apostolic Church of St John the Baptist is in Yangon

Thackers Indian Directory lists many Armenian language names in Burmese business and government The Sarkies Brothers a group of four Armenian brothers best known for founding a chain of hotels throughout Southeast Asia first opened the Eastern  Oriental Hotel in Penang in 1884 before expanding their business to the Raffles Hotel in Singapore and The Strand Hotel in Yangon in 1901 Many Armenians remaining in Burma might also be considered part of the AngloIndian or more correctly the AngloBurmese community Another famous Burmese Armenian is Diana Abgar

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates gives to sets aside for money to specific federal government departments agencies and programs The money provides funding for operations personnel equipment and activities Regular appropriations bills are passed annually with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year

There are three types of appropriations bills regular appropriations bills continuing resolutions and supplemental appropriations bills Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1 If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time it can pass a continuing resolution which continues the preexisting appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year or with minor modifications for a set amount of time The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process They are preceded in that process by the presidents budget proposal congressional budget resolutions and the 302b allocation Article One of the United States Constitution section 9 clause 7 states that No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations The President however still has the power to veto appropriations bills

Public Square Watertown New York
Public Square is an open mall that lies in the center of Watertown New York The square is listed as Public Square Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places encompassing 58 contributing buildings one contributing site and three contributing objects

The square is rectangular in shape Buildings line all four sides of the square while a large oval park sits in its center A oneway traffic pattern circles the park Seven of Watertowns main streets including US Route 11 New York State Route 3 New York State Route 12 and New York State Route 283 intersect at the square making it a heavy traffic destination for motorists

While the square boasts some modern architecture its main character is defined by the numerous 19th and early 20thcentury buildings that still stand Throughout its buildings the square is host to a multitude of shops restaurants business offices churches and apartment houses making it a major shopping and business destination in the city

Watertowns first settlers built their homesteads on what is now the squares West End in 1800 In 1805 several settlers donated land for public use which became the basis of the square This helped to develop the square as Watertowns main business district The current layout of the square and its surrounding streets developed in those early years
In 1849 most of Public Square and buildings on three adjacent streets were destroyed by fire The square was immediately rebuilt Several buildings erected during the rebuilding still stand In the rebuilding of the 1850s the city created three parks at the squares center with a fountain inside the center park During Watertowns industrial boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Public Square became the heart of Watertowns retail business and social life In the 1950s the three parks in the squares center were combined into one large park

The squares retail and business dominance started declining in the latter half of the 20th century Urban renewal policies during the 1960s and 1970s resulted in the demolition of some of the squares historic structures Declining industry hurt Watertowns once prospering economy Although nearby the Fort Drum military reservation expanded in the 1980s and brought growth to the Watertown modern shopping malls and retail chains built on the citys west side drew business away from the square Public Squares days as the citys main retail destination were at an end The square continued its slow decline over the next 20 years

The beginning of the 21st century saw a reversal in attitudes towards Public Square With a resurgence of pride in the square and its role in Watertowns history civic and business leaders have taken a strong role in its redevelopment Existing buildings were refurbished and new businesses moved in Some decaying structures beyond repair were demolished In 2006 the new economic development was coupled with a multimilliondollar streetscape project to reinforce the squares infrastructure as well as beautify its roads walkways and landscaping This project was completed in November 2008

Public Square has been the site of many notable people buildings and inventions

<doc id="7717480" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717480" title="The Chesterfield Supper Club">
The Chesterfield Supper Club
The Chesterfield Supper Club is an NBC Radio musical variety program 19441950 which was also telecast by NBC Television 19481950

The Chesterfield Supper Club began on December 11 1944 as a 15minute radio program airing at 7pm weeknights on the NBC Radio Network This musical variety show was sponsored by Chesterfield cigarettes and featured live musical performances Perry Como initially hosted The Chesterfield Supper Club five nights a week Initially Comos female singer was Mary Ashworth

The idea for the radio show originated with Doug Storer who was then an advertising executive with the Blackman Company Storer had heard Perry Como on his nonsponsored CBS radio program and believed he would do well in a radio show of the type he was proposing Storer recorded a demo of the radio show with Como as its host and Mitchell Ayres and his Orchestra providing the music He took the recording to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield cigarettes account

The agency was enthusiastic about the programs format but did not want Como as its host The singer the agency preferred was under contract and would need to be released from it before he could accept a job on the new radio program They asked Storer to get the singer released from his contract Storer who was still of the belief that the new show needed Como as its host did not go through with the advertising agencys request He received a call from the agency some weeks later asking about the singers contract and saying their new program would make its radio debut in about one weeks time Storer told them the right man for the radio show was the one who had made the demo recordingPerry Como Chesterfields advertising agency did not have time to do anything but sign Como as the host of the show

During the first year Como was backed by the Ted Steele Orchestra followed by the Lloyd Shaffer Orchestra at the end of 1945 until 1948 With John Klenner Shaffer and Steele composed the shows theme song Smoke Dreams Roy Ringwalds A Cigarette Sweet Music and You was also used on the show as a musical theme The Satisfiers vocal group was also part of the program they also made many records with Como

Beginning on the shows second anniversary he hosted the show on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays while Jo Stafford was the host on Tuesdays and Thursdays Stafford returned to California shortly after becoming a cohost of the program She began her twiceweekly broadcasts from Hollywood in November 1946 backed by her future husband Paul Weston Staffords Hollywood Club broadcasts featured the vocal group The Starlighters in 1947 she recorded her version of the shows theme song Smoke Dreams with them
One of the regular features was a Hollywood Star of the Week contest where an actor or actress would be featured as a guest star singing a song and the listening audience would guess the stars identity for prizes The mystery star contest continued when the show appeared on television

The broadcasts of April 5 1946 made from a TWA plane at an altitude of 20000 feet are believed to be the first network radio broadcasts from an airplane Jo Stafford Perry Como and the entire staff made the flight There were two midair Supper Club broadcasts one at 6pm and another at 10pm for the West Coast A total of three flights were made an earlier rehearsal flight for reception purposes was also made In addition to the cast and the bands instruments there was also a small piano on board The three standheld microphones brought onto the plane turned out to be less useful than expected The cast then resorted to handheld microphones but the planes cabin pressure made them very heavy and difficult to hold after a few minutes

Less than two months after the airborne Supper Club broadcasts Chesterfield had an idea to take the program on a week of remote broadcasts flying into Washington DC for the Monday show to London for the Wednesday one and winding up with the Friday night show in Havana The plan appears to have fallen from favor when it was learned that the taxes which would have been imposed on the Shaffer orchestra as foreign musicians performing in the UK meant Chesterfield would have needed to pay all orchestra members three times the amount of salary they were receiving at the time

By 1947 announcer Martin Block was based in the Los Angeles area Block did the announcing from Hollywood on the same days that Stafford hosted the show Announcer and sportscaster Mel Allen took over the New York announcing duties for that year When Blocks West Coast contract was up he returned to New York as the shows announcer Block was also the announcer for the Supper Club television show

In 1948 singer Peggy Lee was added to the roster taking over the Thursday broadcast Como was still broadcasting from New York now backed by the Mitchell Ayres orchestra The Satisfiers were replaced by the singing Fontane Sisters who also appeared with Como on the televised Supper Club and his later television shows

Both Stafford and Lee broadcast from Hollywood Stafford continued to be backed by Paul Weston and his orchestra while Peggy Lee was backed by her husband Dave Barbour and his orchestra The show featured musical performances by the host along with various guest singers and orchestras including Frank Sinatra Judy Garland Eddie Fisher the Glenn Miller Orchestra Nat King Cole Victor Borge and others

By September 1949 the shows time was extended from 15 minutes to a halfhour and it was changed from a weekday to a weekly program

Beginning in February 2010 Sounds of Yesteryear began issuing CDs created from Armed Forces Radio Service AFRS transcriptions of the program from the years 1946 and 1947 At the Supper Club At the Supper Club Part II and At the Supper Club Part III for Perry Como At the Supper Club At the Supper Club Part II At the Supper Club Part III for Jo Stafford and At the Supper Club for Peggy Lee
The Chesterfield Supper Club appeared as a simulcast on NBC Television beginning Christmas Eve 1948 with a live performance by Perry Como This was the beginning of Comos longstanding tradition of television Christmas specials

Initially NBC had intended to broadcast three Friday night Supper Club shows on television as well as radio The experiment had gone well enough for NBC to extend the experimental phase of televising The Chesterfield Supper Club through August 1949

On September 8 1949 Supper Club became a regularly scheduled television program This series was the first of four regular primetime musical variety TV series hosted by Perry Como He continued to host The Chesterfield Supper Club until 1950 when he moved to CBS and the NBC series ended However his association with Chesterfield continued with the Perry Como Chesterfield Show until 1955 when he returned to NBC

<doc id="7717481" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717481" title="Employment authorization document">
Employment authorization document
A Form I766 employment authorization document EAD  or EAD card known popularly as a work permit is a document issued by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS that provides temporary employment authorization to noncitizens in the United States

Currently the Form I765 Employment Authorization Document is issued in the form of a standard credit cardsize plastic card enhanced with multiple security features The card contains some basic information about the immigrant name birth date sex immigrant category country of birth photo immigrant registration number also called Anumber card number restrictive terms and conditions and dates of validity This document however should not be confused with the green card

To request an Employment Authorization Document noncitizens who qualify may file Form I765 Application for Employment Authorization Applicants must then send the form via mail to the USCIS Regional Service Center that serves their area If approved an Employment Authorization Document will be issued for a specific period of time based on aliens immigration situation

Thereafter USCIS will issue Employment Authorization Documents in the following categories 

For employmentbased green card applicants the priority date needs to be current to apply for Adjustment of Status I485 at which time an Employment Authorization Document can be applied for Typically it is recommended to apply for Advance Parole at the same time so that visa stamping is not required when reentering US from a foreign country

An interim Employment Authorization Document is an Employment Authorization Document issued to an eligible applicant when US Citizenship and Immigration Services has failed to adjudicate an application within 90 days of receipt of a properly filed Employment Authorization Document application or within 30 days of a properly filed initial Employment Authorization Document application based on an asylum application filed on or after January 4 1995 The interim Employment Authorization Document will be granted for a period not to exceed 240 days and is subject to the conditions noted on the document

An interim Employment Authorization Document is no longer issued by local service centers One can however take an INFOPASS appointment and place a service request at local centers explicitly asking for it if the application exceeds 90 days and 30 days for asylum applicants without an adjudication

The eligibility criteria for employment authorization is detailed in the Federal Regulations section 8 CFR 274a12 Only aliens who fall under the enumerated categories are eligible for an employment authorization document Currently there are more than 40 types of immigration status that make their holders eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document card Some are nationalitybased and apply to a very small number of people Others are much broader such as those covering the spouses of E1 E2 E3 or L1 visa holders

The category includes the persons who either are given an Employment Authorization Document incident to their status or must apply for an Employment Authorization Document in order to accept the employment


The following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document nor can they accept any employment in the United States unless the incident of status may allow


The following persons do not qualify for an Employment Authorization Document even if they are authorized to work in certain conditions according to the US Citizenship and Immigration Service regulations 8 CFR Part 274a Some statuses may be authorized to work only for a certain employer under the term of alien authorized to work for the specific employer incident to the status usually who has petitioned or sponsored the persons employment In this case unless otherwise stated by the US Department of Homeland Security no approval from either the US Department of Homeland Security or US Citizenship and Immigration Services is needed


Undocumented immigrants have been considered a source of lowwage labor both in the formal and informal sectors of the economy However in the late 1980s with an increasing influx of unregulated immigration many worried about how this would impact the economy and at the same time citizens Consequently in 1986 Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act in order to control and deter illegal immigration to the United States resulting increasing patrolling of US borders Additionally the Immigration Reform and Control Act implemented new employment regulations that imposed employer sanctions criminal and civil penalties against employers who knowingly hired illegal workers Prior to this reform employers were not required to verify the identity and employment authorization of their employees for the very first time this reform made it a crime for undocumented immigrants to work in the United States 

The Employment Eligibility Verification document I9 was required to be used by employers to verify the identity and employment authorization of individuals hired for employment in the United States While this form is not to be submitted unless requested by government officials it is required that all employers have an I9 form from each of their employees which they must be retain for three years after day of hire or one year after employment is terminated

Concurrently the Immigration Act of 1990 increased the limits on lawful immigration to the United States  established new nonimmigrant admission categories and revised acceptable grounds for deportation Most importantly it brought to light the authorized temporary protected status for aliens of designated countries

Through the revision and creation of new classes of nonimmigrants qualified for admission and temporary working status both IRCA and the Immigration Act of 1990 provided legislation for the regulation of employment of noncitizen

The 911 attacks brought to the surface the weak aspect of the immigration system After the September 11 attacks the United States intensified its focus on interior reinforcement of immigration laws to reduce illegal immigration and to identify and remove criminal aliens

Undocumented Immigrants are individuals in the United States without lawful status When these individuals qualify for some form of relief from deportation individuals may qualify for some form of legal status In this case temporarily protected noncitizens are those who are granted the right to remain in the country and work during a designated period Thus this is kind of an inbetween status that provides individuals temporary employment and temporary relief from deportation but it does not lead to permanent residency or citizenship status Therefore an Employment Authorization Document should not be confused with a legalization document and it is neither US permanent resident status nor US citizenship status The Employment Authorization Document is given as mentioned before to eligible noncitizens as part of a reform or law that gives individuals temporary legal status

The House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies is a standing subcommittee within the House Appropriations Committee The United States House Committee on Appropriations has joint jurisdiction with the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations over all appropriations bills in the United States Congress Each committee has 12 matching subcommittees each of which is tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills This subcommittee has jurisdiction over the budget for the United States Department of Energy and Water Development

Traditionally after a federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year has been passed the appropriations subcommittees receive information about what the budget sets as their spending ceilings This is called 302b allocations after section 302b of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 That amount is separated into smaller amounts for each of the twelve Subcommittees The federal budget does not become law and is not signed by the President Instead it is guide for the House and the Senate in making appropriations and tax decisions However no budget is required and each chamber has procedures in place for what to do without one The House and Senate now consider appropriations bills simultaneously although originally the House went first The House Committee on Appropriations usually reports the appropriations bills in May and June and the Senate in June Any differences between appropriations bills passed by the House and the Senate are resolved in the fall

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates gives to sets aside for money to specific federal government departments agencies and programs The money provides funding for operations personnel equipment and activities Regular appropriations bills are passed annually with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year 

There are three types of appropriations bills regular appropriations bills continuing resolutions and supplemental appropriations bills Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1 If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time it can pass a continuing resolution which continues the preexisting appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year or with minor modifications for a set amount of time The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief 

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process They are preceded in that process by the presidents budget proposal congressional budget resolutions and the 302b allocation Article One of the United States Constitution section 9 clause 7 states that No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations The President however still has the power to veto appropriations bills

HMS Wilton M1116
HMS Wilton M1116 was a prototype coastal minesweeperminehunter for the Royal Navy She was the first warship in the world to be constructed from glassreinforced plastic GRP Her design was based upon the existing Ton class minesweepers and she was fitted with equipment recovered from the scrapped HMS Derriton The use of GRP gave the vessel a low magnetic signature against the threat of magnetic mines

On commissioning Wilton joined the 2nd Mine Counter Measures Squadron based at Portsmouth In 1974 she took part in Operation Rheostat the Royal Navys part of the international efforts to clear the Suez Canal of mines In November that year Wilton rejoined 2nd MCMS interrupting her service with that squadron to be seconded to STANAVFORCHAN NATOs Standing Naval Force Channel in 1977 and 1980

Yoshika Matsubara
Born in Hamamatsu Shizuoka Prefecture Matsubara spent time playing with CA Penarol of Uruguay upon graduating from Tokai University Shoyo Senior High School He joined J1 League team Jbilo Iwata in 1994 upon his return to Japan then making a series of moves starting with Shimizu SPulse JEF United Ichihara Rijeka of Croatia Delemont of Switzerland Shonan Bellmare Progreso of Uruguay Avispa Fukuoka Defensor Sporting of Uruguay Okinawa Kariyushi FC and Shizuoka FC Playing for a total of 12 different clubs during his playing career

Matsubara also represented the Japan U23 National team and was part of the 1996 Summer Olympics team which famously defeated the Brazil which included players such as Rivaldo Roberto Carlos and Bebeto

After announcing his retirement in 2005 he established Felice Mondo Inc as the CEO of the company He also holds the positions of General Manager of the Gyosei International School Astra International football program and Vice Chairman of the JLeague Players OB Party

Born in Hamamatsu Matsubara was influenced by his older brother Shinya Matsubara in his start to football Shinya captained his school team and Matsubara was often drawn to watch some of his games

Shinya moved to Argentina in his second year of high school and signed a professional football contract Following in his older brothers footsteps Matsubara sought advice to travel to Argentina himself but was turned down After graduating from high school Matsubara attended university but left shortly after enrolling to reconsider his future Although Matsubara had represented Japan as a member of the national U17 team as the J1 League had not been established at the time he had no particular desire to become a professional football player It was Kazuyoshi Miura who helped change his mind

Upon Kazutoshi Miuras triumphal return from Brazil Matsubara watched one of Miuras games What he saw that day inspired Matsubara to want to become a professional player In his pursuit to sign for a professional club Matsubara participated in trials at his local clubs Shimizu SPulse and Yamaha Motors Now Jbilo Iwata clubs which were on the brink of joining the J1 League at the time Matsubara was unsuccessful however and instead decided to travel abroad to find a club after being recommended by Masakuni Yamamoto of the Japan Football Association who was putting together a team to compete in the 1996 Summer Olympics at the time

Starting in Uruguay Matsubara moved to Europe to play in Switzerland Croatia and Germany before making his way back to South America to experience football in Brazil and Argentina After returning to Japan to play for several clubs in the J1 League Matsubara retired from football after completing a spell at Shizuoka FC as player manager

Out of all the countries Matsubara visited Uruguay left the biggest influence on his life He learnt Spanish during his time in Uruguay and now also speaks English Italian and Portuguese He continues to play football for fun with other exJLeaguers under a team called FC Infinitos Matsubara credits Mr Tagawa principle of Gyosei International School of making an enormous impression on his life away from football

Matsubara has been a big fan of Diego Maradona since early childhood and still keeps a picture of Maradona and himself on his wall

After his brother returned from Argentina Shinya joined professional team Shimizu SPulse This move set up a rare sibling derby match up when Shimizu SPulse played Matsubaras team Jbilo Iwata in the reserve league His brother now works in Hamamatsu for the Shizuoka Prefecture Football Association and will work as a coach for Hamamatsu University from 2013

After retiring as a professional player Matsubara struggled searching for a second career at first Ultimately he chose to stay working in the world of football however as a way of giving something back to the sport which made him so successful Founded on the philosophy of teaching children in a relaxed manner and taking time to concentrate on building character Matsubara opened his first Football school in 2005 aiming to offer the best childrens coaching in the country

Later in 2009 Matsubara established FELICE MONDO Inc The company has expanded in recent years establishing football schools in Roppongi Tokyo Urayasu Chiba and Kisarazu Chiba Club teams were also established in Roppongi junior and Urayasu junior youth

Matsubara was also involved in the revitalization project of Gyosei International School through football establishing the Astra International football course and taking the position of General Manager By testing his own management skills and establishing relationships with people from different backgrounds and industries he has gained many supporters and contributors to his project He has a longterm vision of community development through football education across Japan with his ultimate dream of Japan hosting and winning the world cup In order to achieve his dream he has placed importance on improving links with the rest of the world to improve the quality of Japans youth and developing the quality of the JLeague as a whole

2005 Opens FELICE Football School
2009 Established FELICE MONDO INC transition from Felice Football School Position of CEO
Takes position of Gyosei International School General Manager of Astra International course Takes position of Vice Chairman of the JLeague Players OB Party
Becomes player advisor of TAKE ACTION FC Foundation

Felice Mondo name means happy world in Italian A name which Derives from the concept of creating a happy world by playing football As well as operating a number of football schools in the Kanto region the company holds football tournaments in Kisarazu City in cooperation with the City with over 3000 athletes participating annually As a guest Matsubara has invited former Japan national team manager Philippe Troussier exJuventus player Paolo Montero exJapan internationals Tetsuji Hashiratani Yutaka Akita Motohiro Yamaguchi Takayuki Suzuki Eisuke Nakanishi Akihiro Endo Yasuto Honda and Masaaki Sawanobori

Matsubara attended the Instituto Superior de Education Fisica ISEF in Uruguay in 2002 and started studying as a coach Receiving his first coaching certificate in 2005 by 2010 he was awarded with his S Level certificate by the Japan Football Association completing the set which allows him to coachmanage teams in the JLeague

Matsubara believes that in order to build a strong football nation it is important for Japan to nurture its youth Having spent time living abroad in his youth he also emphasizes the importance of travelling abroad while you are young Through various activities he aims to foster humans who can thrive in the world and represent Japan

He considers the importance of offering guidance to children of all ages from early childhood to play a vital role in developing children Accordingly Matsubara has continuously taught over 1000 children of all ages who have attended one of his football schools or clubs Gyosei International Junior High school football club Gakushuin Junior High football club and Gyosei International High school football club

Math wars
Math wars is the debate over modern mathematics education textbooks and curricula in the United States that was triggered by the publication in 1989 of the Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics NCTM and subsequent development and widespread adoption of a new generation of mathematics curricula inspired by these standards

While the discussion about math skills has persisted for many decades the term math wars was coined by commentators such as John A Van de Walle and David Klein The debate is over traditional mathematics and reform mathematics philosophy and curricula which differ significantly in approach and content

The largest supporter of reform in the US has been the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics

One aspect of the debate is over how explicitly children must be taught skills based on formulas or algorithms fixed stepbystep procedures for solving math problems versus a more inquirybased approach in which students are exposed to realworld problems that help them develop fluency in number sense reasoning and problemsolving skills In this latter approach conceptual understanding is a primary goal and algorithmic fluency is expected to follow secondarily Some parents and other stakeholders blame educators saying that failures occur not because the method is at fault but because these educational methods require a great deal of expertise and have not always been implemented well in actual classrooms

A backlash which advocates call poorly understood reform efforts and critics call a complete abandonment of instruction in basic mathematics resulted in math wars between reform and traditional methods of mathematics education

Those who disagree with the inquirybased philosophy maintain that students must first
develop computational skills before they can understand concepts of mathematics These
skills should be memorized and practiced using timetested traditional methods until they become automatic Time is better spent practicing skills rather than in investigations inventing alternatives or justifying more than one correct answer or method In this view estimating answers is insufficient and in fact is considered to be dependent on strong foundational skills Learning abstract concepts of mathematics is perceived to depend on a solid base of knowledge of the tools of the subject

Supporters of traditional mathematics teaching oppose excessive dependence on innovations such as calculators or new technology such as the Logo language Student innovation is acceptable even welcome as long as it is mathematically valid Calculator use can be appropriate after number sense has developed and basic skills have been mastered Constructivist methods which are unfamiliar to many adults and books which lack explanations of methods or solved examples make it difficult to help with homework Compared to worksheets which can be completed in minutes constructivist activities can be more time consuming Reform educators respond that more time is lost in reteaching poorly understood algorithms Emphasis on reading and writing also increases the language load for immigrant students and parents who may be unfamiliar with English

Critics of reform point out that traditional methods are still universally and exclusively used in industry and academia Reform educators respond that such methods are still the ultimate goal of reform mathematics and that students need to learn flexible thinking in order to face problems they may not know a method for Critics maintain that it is unreasonable to expect students to discover the standard methods through investigation and that flexible thinking can only be developed after mastering foundational skills Commentators have argued that there is philosophical support for the notion that algorithmic fluency requires the very types of cognitive activity whose promotion reform advocates often claim is their approaches unique virtue However such arguments assume that reformers do not want to teach the standard algorithms which is a common misunderstanding of the reform position

Some curricula incorporate research by Constance Kamii and others that concluded that direct teaching of traditional algorithms is counterproductive to conceptual understanding of math Critics have protested some of the consequences of this research Traditional memorization methods are replaced with constructivist activities Students who demonstrate proficiency in a standard method are asked to invent another method of arriving at the answer Some parents have accused reform math advocates of deliberately slowing down students with greater ability in order to paperover the inequalities of the American school system Some teachers supplement such textbooks in order to teach standard methods more quickly Some curricula do not teach long division Critics believe the NCTM revised its standards to explicitly call for continuing instruction of standard methods largely because of the negative response to some of these curricula see below College professors and employers have sometimes claimed that students that have been taught using reform curricula do not possess basic mathematical skills One study found that although firstgrade students in 1999 with an average or aboveaverage aptitude for math did equally well with either teacherdirected or studentcentered instruction firstgrade students with mathematical difficulties did better with teacherdirected instruction

Examples of reform curricula introduced in response to the 1989 NCTM standards and the reasons for initial criticism

Critics of reform textbooks say that they present concepts in a haphazard way Critics of the reform textbooks and curricula support traditional textbooks such as Singapore math which emphasizes direct instruction of basic mathematical concepts and Saxon math which emphasizes frequent cumulative review

Reform educators have responded by pointing out that research tends to show that students achieve greater conceptual understanding from standardsbased curricula than traditional curricula and that these gains do not come at the expense of basic skills In fact students tend to achieve the same procedural skill level in both types of curricula as measured by traditional standardized tests More research is needed but the current state of research seems to show that reform textbooks work as well as or better than traditional textbooks in helping students achieve computational competence while promoting greater conceptual understanding than traditional approaches

In 2000 the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics NCTM released the Principles and Standards for School Mathematics PSSM which was seen as more balanced than the original 1989 Standards This led to some calming but not an end to the dispute Two recent reports have led to considerably more cooling of the Math Wars In 2006 NCTM released its Curriculum Focal Points which was seen by many as a compromise position In 2008 the National Mathematics Advisory Panel created by George Bush called for a halt to all extreme positions

In 2006 the NCTM released Curriculum Focal Points a report on the topics considered central for mathematics in prekindergarten through eighth grade Its inclusion of standard algorithms led editorials in newspapers like the Chicago Sun Times to state that the NCTM council has admitted more or less that it goofed and that the new report cited inconsistency in the grade placement of mathematics topics as well as in how they are defined and what students are expected to learn NCTM responded by insisting that it considers Focal Points a step in the implementation of the Standards not a reversal of its position on teaching students to learn foundational topics with conceptual understanding Francis Fennell president of the NCTM stated that there had been no change of direction or policy in the new report and said that he resented talk of math wars The Focal Points were one of the documents consulted to create the new national Common Core Standards which are being adopted by most of the United States

On April 18 2006 President Bush created the National Mathematics Advisory Panel which was modeled after the influential National Reading Panel The National Math Panel examined and summarized the scientific evidence related to the teaching and learning of mathematics concluding in their 2008 report Allencompassing recommendations that instruction should be entirely student centered or teacher directed are not supported by research If such recommendations exist they should be rescinded If they are being considered they should be avoided Highquality research does not support the exclusive use of either approach The Panel effectively called for an end to the Math Wars concluding that research showed conceptual understanding computational and procedural fluency and problem solving skills are equally important and mutually reinforce each other Debates regarding the relative importance of each of these components of mathematics are misguided

The Panels final report met with significant criticism within the mathematics education community for among other issues the selection criteria used to determine highquality research their comparison of extreme forms of teaching and the amount of focus placed on algebra

Dean Benedetti
Dean Benedetti born Dino Alipio Benedetti June 28 1922  January 20 1957 was a saxophone player best known for amateur live recordings he made of fellow saxophonist Charlie Parker As a tenor saxophonist and band leader in California Benedetti first heard a record of Parker in the Spring of 1945 Deeply influenced by the player Benedetti began to study Parker transcribing solos building them into set pieces and working bop into his own playing

A twoweek engagement at LAs HiDeHo Club in early 1947 done on discs was the start of Benedettis recordings In 1948 Benedetti headed to New York with bandmate Jimmy Knepper and recorded Charlie Parker on March 31 and July 7 both of these on a Sears tape recorder

While in New York Benedetti began to use heroin Unable to break into the New York music scene he returned to his parents home in California in 1948 Trying to finance their way back home Benedetti and Knepper attempt to sell drugs However Knepper took the drugs with him back to LA and abandoned Benedetti in New York

Shortly after returning to California Benedetti discovered he had a rare muscle disease Myasthenia Gravis The disease affected his playing and he soon quit performing in public The disease ruined his health and in 1953 he moved in with his parents in Italy He died on January 20 1957 at the age of 34

The recordings he made of Parker were something of a jazz legend until 1988 when these tapes and acetate discs were sold by his brother Rick Benedetti to Mosaic Records The Complete Dean Benedetti Recordings of Charlie Parker box was released by Mosaic Records in 1990

Symphony No 2 Moore
Symphony No 2 in A major is a classical composition by American composer Douglas Moore It was composed in 1945 and received its premiere in Paris on May 5 1946 directed by Robert Lawrence In the following year the American premiere was given in Los Angeles Alfred Wallenstein directing

The symphony is Moores second essay in that form and is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Vincent Bent who supplied the libretto for Moores opera The Devil and Daniel Webster A work of moderate length and a classical conception inspired by Haydn it represents Moores fully formed mature style and is unarguably one of his best pieces Moore himself described it as an attempt to write in clear objective modified classical style with emphasis on rhythmic and melodic momentum rather than upon sharply contrasted themes or dramatic climaxes

It is in four movements three of which end in a quiet manner The symphony lasts approximately twenty minutes

The first movement starts with a solemnly lyric and wistful theme given out by trumpet then oboe and strings which is carried out through the first section in a somewhat nostalgic fashion The calmness is later abandoned in favour of a more lilting and dancelike mood on strings which moves along in a processional way before a crescendo leads to the short coda ending the movement in silence This movement features significant more use of percussion xylophone and triangle than the other three

Whilst the symphony as a whole isnt in any way programmatic the second movement was in part inspired by a James Joyce poem concerning twilight music This is understandable as most of the music is nocturnal save for a few passionate outbursts which may relate to the work In Memoriam of a few years earlier It is clearly indicative of Moores ability to write sensitive and heartfelt music

This is the shortest and most jovial and most obviously neoclassical of all the movements It starts with a happy and bubbling theme on woodwinds which forms the basis of the whole movement In the more animated middle section where the woodwind indulges in some trilling baroquery a second theme on trumpet is countered by the main theme in a delightfully contrapuntal way before winding down into stillness

The beginning of the last movement is proclaimed in a declamatory fashion on brass only to introduce the robust and energetic main theme which persists throughout Following the introduction the orchestra leads into a rondolike section with alternatingly rousing and flowing treatments where the main theme dominates After several louder expositions the main theme is played out faster on strings building up a heroic atmosphere and leading to a bursting crescendo of kinetic energy after which a drumroll leads the movement to the spirited closing diminuendo

Malvern Fringe Festival
The Malvern Fringe Festival was an arts festival founded 1977 which took place in Great Malvern England The main events of the Malvern Fringe Festival were the annual Malvern May Day and parade and the annual threeday festival held in June as a fringe to the Elgar Festival These were often accompanied by musical and other live events throughout the year

Malvern Fringe Festival was founded in 1977 by Adrian Mealing a teacher in Malvern in collaboration with Andrew Sleigh Ian Fearnside and Phil Webb It originated as a reaction to the Malvern Festival which was perceived to be biased towards classical music and appealing towards a national and international audience rather than a local one A further concern was the continued requirement for the local Council to underwrite the main festival and the feeling that the public expenditure could be more wisely spent

The founding aims of the Fringe were to produce a popular varied programme of events for the local people of Malvern to bridge the gap between the us and them in the arts and to shake it up a bit in Malvern

The first year featured 60 events consisting of poetry world music folk jazz adult and childrens theatre performed under the banner of Associated Events due to the main Festivals objections to the term Fringe which they considered to be outside of the Festival In 1978 to avoid confusion between the programmes for the two festivals printed with similar designs at the main festivals insistence Adrian Mealing hand wrote Fringe on over 3000 programmes As the 1980s approached the festival grew into a fourweek event and the Fringe had established its own identity Being centrally located between Hereford Worcester Gloucester and Cheltenham the Fringe drew a wide audiences from over a 20mile radius

During the 1980s the festival attracted hundreds of visitors with a programme of 120 events over a twoweek period

In 2006 the Fringe relaunched its threeday festival in June loosely based upon a theme of Elgars interests One of the highlights of this festival was a bicycle race as cycling was one of Elgars keen interests up the steep incline of Great Malverns Church Street This event was supported by Commonwealth games gold medalist Liam Killeen whos from Malvern and was won by Tour de France cyclist Arnaud Lenoir The whole threeday festival was attended by over 5000 people

In the autumn of 2006 the Fringe launched a folk weekend featuring Roy Bailey and Jez Lowe

The Malvern May Day and Parade are an annual community event which has been held in Priory Park Great Malvern on the Saturday before the May Bank Holiday since 1993

Despite an attendance of over 5000 people the June 2006 festival has been the subject of much negative coverage in the letters pages of the local newspaper with one correspondent calling upon readers to petition the local Member of Parliament to halt any further Fringe activities

Throughout its history Malvern Fringe featured an impressive array of performers many of whom have gone on to become international stars

An appropriations bill is a bill that appropriates gives to sets aside for money to specific federal government departments agencies and programs The money provides funding for operations personnel equipment and activities Regular appropriations bills are passed annually with the funding they provide covering one fiscal year The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year 

There are three types of appropriations bills regular appropriations bills continuing resolutions and supplemental appropriations bills Regular appropriations bills are the twelve standard bills that cover the funding for the federal government for one fiscal year and that are supposed to be enacted into law by October 1 If Congress has not enacted the regular appropriations bills by the time it can pass a continuing resolution which continues the preexisting appropriations at the same levels as the previous fiscal year or with minor modifications for a set amount of time The third type of appropriations bills are supplemental appropriations bills which add additional funding above and beyond what was originally appropriated at the beginning of the fiscal year Supplemental appropriations bills can be used for things like disaster relief 

Appropriations bills are one part of a larger United States budget and spending process They are preceded in that process by the presidents budget proposal congressional budget resolutions and the 302b allocation Article One of the United States Constitution section 9 clause 7 states that No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law This is what gives Congress the power to make these appropriations The President however still has the power to veto appropriations bill

Equix
Equix is a company in Lexington Kentucky founded in 1984 The company evaluates equine biometrics and motion through the use of highspeed digital tools for the purpose of finding athletic potential Their products are used mainly on twoyearold Thoroughbred racehorses at training sales Equix uses the measurements of horses in order to predict potential and in so doing helps clients select both racehorses and breeding matches

Equix has published several studies with the results of their analysis One study found that colts and fillies with below average jaw widths will have a higher probability of becoming graded stakes winners than horses with above average jaw widths This goes against the common perception that a wider jaw is better because it allows the horse to take in more air as they are running Equix also found that better athletes are produced by breeding mares and stallions of similar conformation This is in opposition to the common practice of breeding horses that were found to be the most compatible through computer models of race records and breeding history rather than a comparison of their physical types

Black Band landsknechts
The Black Band was a formation of 16th century mercenaries largely pikemen probably serving as Landsknechts They fought in the French army for ten years seeing service in several notable engagements including the Battle of Marignano and the Battle of Pavia

The Black Band was created as the Black Guard in 1514 by George Duke of Saxony to fight for his claims in East Frisia against Edzard I Count of East Frisia in what was to become known as the Saxon feud

It is not clear whether the band was newly founded or a continuation of the Great or Black Guard that had been founded in 1488 by Landsknechts formerly in Imperial service with Maximilian in Flanders It fought in Northern Germany and Denmark often against rebellious peasants until its defeat at the Battle of Hemmingstedt on 17 February 1500 It is possible that at least some Fhnlein of the Black Guard survived during these fourteen years and were part if not core of the new formation

This Black Guard took part in the campaign in East Frisia in 1514 and devastated large parts of it in the process When the participation of George of Saxony in the Saxon Feud ended in 1515 at the mediation of Charles II Duke of Guelders and Francis I of France Charles of Guelders hired them and led them in support of Francis to Italy where they entered French service 
There they joined an existing contingent of 12000 Landsknechts in French service originally drafted for a planned invasion of England under the Yorkist pretender Richard de la Pole that was aborted after the AngloFrench peace treaty of St GermainenLaye in 1514 Many of these Landsknechts were originally sent on loan to the French by Maximilian between 1512 and 1513 for service in Italy notably at Brescia and Ravenna and had defied his recall to Imperial service Some of the members of the Black Band also chose not to enter French service and heed that recall

The distinction between both contingents gets lost and most sources call the whole French Landsknecht contingent the Black Band or Black Legion at the time of the Battle of Marignano

The full Landsknecht contingent of Francis I army in 1515 was initially 17000 men strong composed of 12000 pikemen 2000 arquebusiers 2000 twohanded swordsmen and 1000 halberdiers Landsknecht contingents are organized in companies or Fhnlein of up to 500 with actual numbers often being lower than the nominal full strength

Captain of the Black Band in 1525 was Georg Langenmantel but it was also placed under the command of French officers such as at Pavia when it was nominally led by Franois de Lorraine and Richard de la Pole By the time of the Battle of Pavia they are described by Delbrck as 5000 strong by Konstam as 4000 strong

The Black Band marched into Italy in 1515 in time to fight alongside King Francis I at the Battle of Marignano where defending the ditch and supported by artillery they nonetheless recoiled from the attacking Swiss but did not break Eventually they were relieved by the charge of the French gendarme heavy cavalry into the flank of the Swiss attack column

Ten years later they were still in French service and appeared as the lead French infantry square at the Battle of Pavia led by Francois de Lorraine and Richard de la Pole In this battle they found themselves heavily outnumbered by two blocks of 12000 Imperial Landsknechts opposing them led by Georg von Frundsberg and Max Sittich von Ems Before the battle Georg Langenmantel Obrist of the band stepped out and tried to challenge Frundsberg or Ems to single combat but was killed by the Imperials in response Struck in both flanks  seized  as if with tongsand hacked to pieces the Black Band was killed almost to the last man including both of their leaders and ceased to exist

It was refounded and fought with a strength of 4000 under Lautrec in the campaign against the Imperial army in Naples The destruction of that army in August 1528 saw some 2000 survivors many of whom found service with the Imperial Landsknechts

<doc id="7717738" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7717738" title="Contact resistance">
Contact resistance
The term contact resistance refers to the contribution to the total resistance of a system which can be attributed to the contacting interfaces of electrical leads and connections as opposed to the intrinsic resistance which is an inherent property independent of the measurement method This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time most often decreasing in a process known as resistance creep The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by William Shockley to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation In addition to the term ECR Interface resistance transitional resistance or just simply correction term are also used The term parasitic resistance has been used as a more general term where it is usually still assumed that the contact resistance has a major contribution

Here we need to distinguish the contact resistance evaluation in twoelectrode systems eg diodes and threeelectrode systems eg transistors

For two electrode systems the specific contact resistivity is experimentally defined as the slope of the IV curve at V0

where J is the current density  currentarea The units of specific contact resistivity are typically therefore in formula2 where formula3 stands for ohms When the current is a linear function of the voltage the device is said to have ohmic contacts

The resistance of contacts can be crudely estimated by comparing the results of a four terminal measurement to a simple twolead measurement made with an ohmmeter In a twolead experiment the measurement current causes a potential drop across both the test leads and the contacts so that the resistance of these elements is inseparable from the resistance of the actual device with which they are in series In a fourpoint probe measurement one pair of leads is used to inject the measurement current while a second pair of leads in parallel with the first is used to measure the potential drop across the device In the fourprobe case there is no potential drop across the voltage measurement leads so the contact resistance drop is not included The difference between resistance derived from twolead and fourlead methods is a reasonably accurate measurement of contact resistance assuming that the leads resistance is much smaller Specific contact resistance can be obtained by multiplying by contact area It should also be noted that the contact resistance may vary with temperature

Inductive and capacitive methods could be used in principle to measure an intrinsic impedance without the complication of contact resistance In practice direct current methods are more typically used to determine resistance

The three electrode systems such as transistors require more complicated methods for the contact resistance approximation The most common approach is the transmission line model TLM Here the total device resistance formula4 is plotted as a function of the channel length

where formula6 and formula7 are contact and channel resistances respectively formula8 is the channel lengthwidth formula9 is gate insulator capacitance per unit of area formula10 is carrier mobility and formula11 and formula12 are gatesource and drainsource voltages Therefore the linear extrapolation of total resistance to the zero channel length provides the contact resistance The slope of the linear function is related to the channel transconductance and can be used for estimation of the contact resistancefree carrier mobility The approximations used here linear potential drop across the channel region constant contact resistance lead sometimes to the channel dependent contact resistance

Beside the TLM it was proposed the gated fourprobe measurement and the modified timeofflight method TOF The direct methods able to measure potential drop on the injection electrode directly are the Kelvin probe force microscopy KFM and the electricfield induced second harmonic generation

For given physical and mechanical material properties parameters that govern the magnitude of electrical contact resistance ECR and its variation at an interface relate primarily to surface structure and applied load Contact mechanics Surfaces of metallic contacts generally exhibit an external layer of oxide material and adsorbed water molecules which lead to capacitortype junctions at weakly contacting asperities and resistor type contacts at strongly contacting asperities where sufficient pressure is applied for asperities to penetrate the oxide layer forming metaltometal contact patches If a contact patch is sufficiently small with dimensions comparable or smaller than the mean free path of electrons resistance at the patch can be described by the Sharvin mechanism whereby electron transport can be described by ballistic conduction Generally over time contact patches expand and the contact resistance at an interface relaxes particularly at weakly contacting surfaces through current induced welding and dielectric breakdown This process is known also as resistance creep The coupling of surface chemistry contact mechanics and charge transport mechanisms needs to be considered in the mechanistic evaluation of ECR phenomena

When a conductor has spatial dimensions close to formula13 where formula14 is Fermi wavevector of the conducting material Ohms law does not hold anymore These small devices are called quantum point contacts Their conductance must be an integer multiple of the value formula15 where formula16 is the electronic charge and formula17 is Plancks constant Quantum point contacts behave more like waveguides than the classical wires of everyday life and may be described by the Landauer scattering formalism Pointcontact tunneling is an important technique for characterizing superconductors

Measurements of thermal conductivity are also subject to contact resistance with particular significance in heat transport through granular media Similarly a drop in hydrostatic pressure analogous to electrical voltage occurs when fluid flow transitions from one channel to another

Bad contacts are the cause of failure or poor performance in a wide variety of electrical devices For example corroded jumper cable clamps can frustrate attempts to start a vehicle that has a low battery Dirty or corroded contacts on a fuse or its holder can give the false impression that the fuse is blown A sufficiently high contact resistance can cause substantial heating in a high current device Unpredictable or noisy contacts are a major cause of the failure of electrical equipment

Hurry On Sundown
Hurry On Sundown is a 1970 song by the UK rock group Hawkwind It was originally released as a single in the UK on 26 June 1970 being an edit of the version that appeared on the album Hawkwind

Towards the end of 1969 still using the name Hawkwind Zoo and with Mick Slattery as the lead guitarist the band were given studio time by Don Poole to record some demos Hurry On Sundown was one of the tracks recorded this version being more electric and psychedelic than the acoustic folky feel of the album version The recording was eventually released in 1981 as the first of a host of archive material issued through Flicknife Records

Another previously unheard track recorded at the same session Sweet Mistress of Pain also known as Kiss of the Velvet Whip was included on the Bside as was an alternate version of the 1975 single Kings of Speed The two original Hawkwind Zoo demos were eventually included on the remasters version of the Hawkwind debut album with a third a cover of Pink Floyds Cymbaline

The band recorded a version at Maida Vale Studios on 18 August 1970 for broadcast on the BBC Radio programme Top Gear on 19 September 1970 Poor quality recordings of this session were first released without the BBCs permission on The Text of Festival in 1983 then on various subsequent compilations No official clean version of this track has ever been released

Glasspar
The Glasspar boatbuilding company was started in 1947 when Bill Tritt began building small fiberglass boat hulls in his Costa Mesa California fiberglass shop

Bill Tritt had a keen interest in boats and cars before World War II when he studied marine architecture and boatbuilding at California State Teachers College in Santa Barbara California He worked for Douglas Aircrafts Production Planning and Illustration Departments during WWII and by 1945 had built a number of catamaran sailboats In 1947 John Green a yachtsman friend paid Tritt to design and build a racing sailboat in the range Fiberglass seemed the logical construction material and Otto Bayer of Wizard Boats was enlisted as laminator The boat was named the Green Dolphin and four were built in various lengths This was Tritts first effort in fiberglassreinforced plastic FRP By 1948 he was building small fiberglass sailing dinghies and built the first ever fiberglass masts and spars for sailboats This company became the Glasspar Company and moved to larger quarters from Industrial Way in Costa Mesa to Harbor Blvd in Costa Mesa California in 1950 By 1951 Glasspar moved again to larger quarters in Santa Ana California By the mid1950s Glasspar was producing 15 to 20 percent of all fiberglass boats sold in the US By 1958 branch factories were operating in Nashville Tennessee Petersburg Virginia Olympia Washington and Sherman Texas

Glasspar built boats in ranges from car toppers to models and everything in between Just prior to 1969 when Glasspar was sold off there were even oceangoing models Boats were often given Mediterraneansounding names and the boat classes within the model were often indicated by a model type then model name with a hyphen in between For example in the range there was a model called the Lido which came in three configurations the SportLido ClubLido and Lido standard Another line called the Mariner included the SportMariner ClubMariner or Mariner standard model Some boat models were also named for areas in and around Southern California such as Avalon on the island of Catalina and Del Mar a coastal community north of San Diego

Models included but were not limited to

Glasspar was also one of the first companies to build fiberglassbodied cars most notably the G2 Glasspar but including the Woodill Wildfire the Studebakerbased Ascot and the Volvo Sport The G2 was a prime influence on the decision for Chevrolet to develop the Corvette

The company was eventually sold to Larson Boat Works

Restoring and preserving Glasspar boats and cars has become extremely popular in recent years The official Glasspar Owners Association can be found at Classic Glasspars

Extensive information can be found at the Owners Association Website to include factory brochures production data and even patents

Tabloid Baby
Tabloid Baby is a 1999 memoir and expos by veteran journalist and television news producer Burt Kearns detailing his years as producer of the leading tabloid television shows of the 1990s A Current Affair and Hard Copy Published shortly before broadcast news was displaced by cable the book is notable for its argument that tabloid television was coopted by network news shows such as CBSs 48 Hours which premiered in 1988 and NBCs Dateline which premiered in 1992 as well as demonstrating the emerging audience psychology that would lead to the explosion of reality shows in the 2000s and the openly subjective reporting that would find its apotheosis in Fox News and MSNBC on cable

Tabloid Baby was described by former A Current Affair host Maury Povich as The Bible as in Burt was there for the birthing of tabloid he became the heart of the genre and now hes written the Bible and by veteran CBS newsman and 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace as sad funny undeniably authentic telling the tale of what befell too much of mainstream television news over the past couple of decades as the bad drove out the good

In recent years the term tabloid baby has been used to describe the current crop of television news producers reporters and executives who were trained or got their starts in the tabloid television system

The Party Line radio
The Party Line is a British radio sitcom cowritten by Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis and produced by Adam Bromley It was originally broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 2005 and 2008 The show stars James Fleet as Duncan Stonebridge a Labour Member of Parliament for the imaginary Rothershurst which appears to be a marginal constituency in the north of England one which was traditionally Conservative but turned Labour under Tony Blair In line with the national trend the elections of 2005 saw Stonebridges majority reduced to 27 Stonebridge is a Londoner and according to his constituency agent Roger Geoffrey McGivern was parachuted in by RAF Millbank

The show follows the everyday life of the MP Each episode begins and concludes with Stonebridge travelling on the train from London and a short witty dialogue between Stonebridge and a railway attendant Most episodes then revolve around Stonebridges attempt to gain publicity in his constituency ultimately being thwarted by an unlikely twist of fate or bad luck Stonebridge finds it difficult to fill the shoes of his predecessor Sir Digby whose name still looms large in the shape of his widow Lady Harriet Geraldine McNulty In the third series Harriet becomes Duncans constituency secretary He also struggles to keep one step ahead of Angela his imageconscious and media savvy Conservative rival It is an ongoing joke that he is secretly attracted to Angela

The middle of each show features Stonebridges constituency surgery dealing with problems from constituents of variable sanity including Mrs Digweed who insists the constituency needs a badger tunnel and doesnt believe hes doing enough to get this discussed in Parliament

Other characters include Jane Rachel Atkins Duncans longsuffering sister and the other members of the constituency team the aggressive Ruth and the geeky Neil Various characters are played by Simon Greenall Beth Chalmers Manjit Mann and Dan Mersh

The show was typically written and produced only 24 hours before it was broadcast so it sometimes contained references to current events

Greater pewee
The greater pewee Contopus pertinax is a passerine and is in the tyrant flycatcher group This species range is further north than the other Mexican species This bird was formerly known as Coues flycatcher

This species is slightly longer than the olivesided flycatcher The adult greater pewee is the largest breeding Contopus flycatcher to breed in the US It is a dull graybrown bird all over with some birds that have a buff wash on the breast They have indistinct wingbars and a very distinct crest The lower mandible is bright orange and that is an easy way to distinguish them from olivesided flycatchers in eastern Arizona and west central New Mexico They are 8inches 203cm long have a 13in 33cm wingspan and weigh 1oz 28g

These birds love to stay high in trees scanning for insects They sally and hawk insects from their high perches The greater pewee defends its nesting grounds aggressively They will attack hawks jays and squirrels Their diet consists of insects and maybe berries in cooler months Their song is a whistled five syllables deelip deeree ah or famously known as jose maria The opening deelip is repeated several times before the rest of the song It also gives pip calls like the olivesided flycatcher

The greater pewee prefers montane pine forests with an oak understory Also found in montane deciduous especially Arizona sycamore forests and mixed montane oakpine forest They are found more easily in elevations over 6500feet in Arizona and New Mexico They are rare in western Texas

The greater pewee is found yearround in central and southern Mexico south through Costa Rica and Nicaragua It breeds from central Mexico north to southeast and central Arizona and southwest New Mexico Rarely does it reach southern California southern Nevada or western Texas

The female builds the nest high in a horizontal fork of a conifer The nest is compact and attached by cobwebs It is made of grass and weeds and is decorated with lichen The nest is usually lined with fine grasses The female lays three or four creamy white eggs sparsely marked with or wreathed with browns and olive The eggs are 08in 21mm

Pinacol
Pinacol is a white solid organic compound It is a diol that has hydroxyl groups OH on vicinal carbon atoms

It may be produced by the pinacol coupling reaction from 
acetone

As a vicinaldiol it can rearrange to pinacolone by the pinacol rearrangement eg by heating with sulfuric acid

Pinacol can be used with borane and boron trichloride to produce useful synthetic intermediates such as pinacolborane bispinacolatodiboron and pinacolchloroborane

Ozolian Locris
Ozolian Locris  or Hesperian Locris  was a region in Ancient Greece inhabited by the Ozolian Locrians   a tribe of the Locrians upon the Corinthian Gulf bounded on the north by Doris on the east by Phocis and on the west by Aetolia

Various etymologies were proposed by the ancients about the origin of the name of the regions inhabitants the Ozolai  Some derived it from the Greek verb ozein which means to smell According to Strabo this version could be explained by the stench arising from a spring at the foot of Mount Taphiassus beneath which Nessus and other centaurs had been buried while according to Plutarch that was due to the asphodel which scented the air For the first of these two versions Pausanias said that as he had heard Nessus ferrying on Evenus was wounded by Heracles but not killed on the spot making him escape to this country and when he died his body rotted unburied imparting a stench to the atmosphere of the place Other variations about the origin of the name from the above verb that Pausanias included in his work Description of Greece are a that the exhalations of a river had a peculiar smell and b that the first dwellers of the region did not know how to weave garments so they wore untanned skins which were smelly

Another version mentioned by Pausanias was that Orestheus son of Deucalion king of the land had a bitch which gave birth to a stick instead of a puppy and Orestheus buried it from which a vine grew in the spring and from its branches called ozoi in Greek the people got their name

Ozolian Locris is mountainous and for the most part unproductive The declivities of Mount Parnassus from Phocis on the east Aselinon oros in the centre and Mount Corax from Aetolia on the west occupy the greater part of it The only rivers whose names are mentioned in antiquity are Hylaethus and Daphnus the latter is nowadays called Mornos which runs in a southwesterly direction and flows into the Corinthian gulf near Naupactus The frontier of the Ozolian Locrians on the west was close to the promontory Antirrhium opposite the promontory Rhium on the coast of Achaea The eastern frontier of Locris on the coast was close to the Phocian town of Crissa and the Crissaean gulf washed on its western side the Locrian and on its eastern the Phocian coast Ozolian Locris is said to have been a colony from the Opuntian Locrians

The chief town of the Ozolians was Amphissa and their most important port Naupactus Other important towns of the region were the coastal town of Chalaeum on the west of the modern town Itea Myonia and Tritaea on the foot of Aselinon oros southwest of Amphissa on the western slope of Parnassus the towns Ipnus Hessus and Messapia the coastal town Oeantheia on the western edge of the Crissaean gulf and farther on the west Phaestus Tolophon Anticirrha Erythrae Eupalium Oeneon Macynia and Molycreio which owned Antirrhium More inland from west to east were Aegitium Croculeium Teichium Olpae and Hyle

They first appear in history in the time of the Peloponnesian War when they are mentioned by Thucydides as a semibarbarous nation along with the Aetolians and Acarnanians whom they resembled in their armour and mode of fighting In 426 BCE the Locrians promised to assist Demosthenes the Athenian commander in his invasion of Aetolia but after the defeat of Demosthenes most of the Locrian tribes submitted without opposition to Spartan Eurylochus who marched through their territory from Delphi to Naupactus They belonged at a later period to the Aetolian League

Carl Heggs
Carl Heggs born 11 October 1970 in Leicester England is a former professional footballer who played for 13 different clubs including West Bromwich Albion and Swansea City Heggs was most recently manager at Hinckley United having originally joined the club as an assistant in the summer of 2012 before resigning in May 2013 Heggs was forced out of retirement towards the end of November 2012 as Hinckley United were short for players He was also the caretaker manager of League One side Notts County after Paul Ince was sacked in 2011

Heggs started his professional career in 1991 with Midlands side West Bromwich Albion following a 25000 move from his local side Leicester United After progressing through the reserve team Heggs managed to force his way in the first team setup in which he would go on to spend four seasons with the club Heggs made 40 appearances and found the net on three occasions for the Baggies

After losing his place in the first team Heggs was seeking a return to regular first team football and joined Bristol Rovers for the later part of the 1995 season Heggs made five appearances and scoring one goal

Carl moved away from West Bromwich Albion on 27 July 1995 and joined Swansea City for a fee of 60000 Heggs spent two seasons with the club making 43 appearances and scoring seven goals

On 1 August 1997 Heggs make the return north to join Northampton Town for 25000 having been on the losing side against the Cobblers in the Division Three playoff final three months earlier Heggs spent just over one season with the Cobblers making 49 appearances and scoring six goals but he would team up with manager Ian Atkins again elsewhere

Heggs signed for Rushden  Diamonds in October 1998 in a joint deal with teammate Ray Warburton worth a reported 100000 He scored on his debut against Morecambe but after that found goals hard to come by scoring only five in his 49 games for the club

The undoubted highlight of Heggs spell at Rushden was scoring the opening goal in a 31 FA Cup Third Round Replay defeat to Premiership side Leeds United at Elland Road

Heggs was unusually loaned from a nonLeague club to a Football League club when he joined Chester City in March 2000 as he teamed up again with Ian Atkins However the Blues were in grave danger of losing their league status when Heggs arrived He quickly struck up an effective partnership with Luke Beckett which proved particularly successful in a 50 win over Mansfield Town but it was not enough to avert relegation and Heggs moved on

On 28 July 2000 Heggs joined Third Division side Carlisle United on a twoyear contract However he only spent one season with the club making 30 appearances and scoring five goals in the process as the side narrowly avoided relegation from Football League under Ian Atkins

Heggs signed for Conference National side Forest Green Rovers in 2001 playing under former England international Nigel Spink He spent a season at the non league side making just under 40 appearances before moving on to Ilkeston Town

On 1 June 2005 Heggs joined Staffordshire side Tamworth of the Conference National His time at Tamworth saw him involved in two notable goals A 25yard screamer against Halifax Town in a 21 defeat and a powerful and determined run through the heart of the Stoke City defence laying off a perfect pass for Nathan Jackson to slot into the empty net for the opening goal of the replay however Tamworth lost the game on penalties after drawing 11 in normal time

He was even subject of a move during his time with Tamworth but opted to turn down a move to Hucknall Town on 1 March 2006 to help Tamworths fight against relegation During his time with the club Heggs made 25 appearances and scored four goals

Heggs joined Hinckley United on 10 July 2006 with the chance of regular first team football being the major factor in his decision Heggs however found that his first team promise wasnt quite as true as he was led to believe and after spending more time on the bench and out of the team than he had wished for he left after just less than six months with the club

On 22 May 2007 Heggs rejoined Tamworth stating that he was delighted to be back at club

After just six appearances on his return to the club Heggs was released after the management could not guarantee first team football

Heggs rejoined Redditch United for his second spell on 17 October 2007 and was appointed as the clubs playercoach

Heggs rejoined former team Hinckley United for the second time in February 2010

In August 2011 Heggs signed along with Jon Stevenson and Matt Piper both formerly of Leicester City for East Midlands Counties Football League side Oadby Town

Heggs was appointed manager of Kings Lynn on 1 June 2009 This was ended as the club were wound up by the HMRC

Following his second spell as a player at Hinckley United Heggs was appointed as Chief Scout at Notts County On 3 April 2011 Heggs was appointed caretaker manager at Notts County for two matches

On 3 June 2012 Heggs was appointed assistant manager of Hinckley United replacing Marc Faulkner for the 20122013 season Heggs is highly regarded as having excellent knowledge of local football players in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire After Hinckley United manager Dean Thomas resigned on 10 October 2012 following an early FA Cup exit and a poor start to the Conference North league campaign Heggs was put in caretaker charge of the football club alongside Neil Lyne He also threw his hat into the ring for the managers position on a permanent basis according to a club statement On Thursday 15 November Heggs was offered the managers job on a permanent basis until the end of the 20122013 season Heggs later accepted the offer Heggs came out of retirement on 19 November for a game against Bradford PA with Hinckley United desperate for players

Heggs got his first win in charge of Hinckley United on 4 December in a Westerby Challenge Cup Round One game against St Andrews The game finished 21 with goals from Jack Lane and a header from Aron Wint On 28 February 2013 it was announced in the Hinckley Times that Heggs had signed a new contract until the end of the 20132014 season after being given the assurances he was looking for from the board On 8 April 2013 Heggs finally got his first league victory since taking charge of Hinckley United with a 63 win against Corby Town a hattrick from Luke Richards and goals from Jack Lane Harvey Headley and Liam Canavan gave the Knitters just their second league win of the season On 21 May Heggs announced his intention to resign as manager of Hinckley United to become a PE teacher at Ascot College Derbyshire

Associationalism
Associationalism or associative democracy is a political movement in which human welfare and liberty are both best served when as many of the affairs of a society as possible are managed by voluntary and democratically selfgoverning associations Associationalism gives priority to freedom in its scale of values but it contends that such freedom can only be pursued effectively if individuals join with their fellows

Associationalism is a European political theory stemming from 19th and early 20th century social and political theorists from the continent In France such political thinkers as de Tocqueville Proudhon Durkheim and Duguit In England such pluralists as Cole Figgis Laski Barker and Maitland The theory provides an alternative to the previously popular doctrines of statecentered and collectivist ideals which had all but dominated twentiethcentury politics Western social democracy and Eastern bloc MarxistLeninism

Alexis de Tocquevilles idea of associationalism stressed volunteerism community spirit and independent associational life as protections against the domination of society by the state and indeed as a counterbalance which helped to keep the state accountable and effective In Tocquevilles vision then economic freedom fosters greed which engenders political apathy which results in excessive individualism and passive reliance on the state This political apathy will in turn result in the almost inevitable growth of government if left unchecked by associationalism Thus Tocqueville predicted that It is easy to see the time coming in which men will be less and less able to produce by each alone the commonest bare necessities of life The tasks of government must therefore perpetually increase and its efforts to cope with them must spread its net ever wider The more government takes the place of associations the more will individuals lose the idea of forming associations and need the government to come to their help That is a vicious cycle of cause and effect

Associational democracy is in essence both a political structure and system of relations with the goal of easing pluralist social negotiation and priorities It became an important aspect of public policy countering previous laissezfaire traditions Critics considered laissezfaire which essentially equated to liberal individualism as not conducive to the fostering of upward mobility in society Associationalism as opposed to liberal individualism embodies a deliberate commitment to social cooperation as well as public wellbeing
Associationgrew out of a sense of difference for the middle class it meant crossing class lines to bring together people of diverse identities and conditions According to David Lewis during the late 19th and early 20th century the new middle class required sanctioned private accumulation underwritten by a state which maintained legal order and stability As a result the state needed to become powerful enough to maintain order but not so strong as to become oppressive neither laissezfaire nor statist Finding this balance between transgressing autonomy and dangerous accumulation of power could prove difficult and associationalism appeared to be a possible solution
Associationalism brought together several political ideologies which until its conception were frequently at odds pluralism socialism and cooperative mutualism It provides for a pluralist rather than a statist or constraining collectivist socialism yet it also provides for a mutualist and cooperative pluralism This as opposed to pluralism which reacts so far to statist communitarianism that it slides into an unrestricted competitive asociality

Urban politics in late 19th century America proved an ideal situation for the emergence of associationalism ripe with several qualifications discussed by early associationalists In addition voter turnout was relatively high though usually confined to party lines Despite this fact the two large national parties at the time Democrats and Republicans lacked significant ideological differences on specific issues Respected members of communities across the country began to propose associationalism as a solution to Americas social political problems Several Protestant ministers such as Lyman Abbot Washington Gladden Josiah Strong and Walter Raushenbusch began to call for a social gospel The next great principle Rauschenbusch proclaimed in 1896 is association These growing political currents in favor of associationalism perhaps culminated when voters elected William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt a left statist associationalist who would become president shortly thereafter in 1900

Associationalism is fundamentally about collective governance  about the legal constitution of groups and bodies politic and the rules and bylaws that regulate the interrelationships of members During the early 20th century Congress passed a great deal of protective legislation which was in essence legislated associationalism Labor received improved work conditions resulting in fewer workrelated injuries Wages were increased while hours were decreased In addition probably the most important protective legislation pertained to the legal establishment and organization of large labor unions

On the other side of the coin employer costs went up resulting in outsourcing and decreased cash flow into such areas as research and development slowing technological progress Fewer hours and the fact that labor was more organized allowing for an increase in strikes and protests resulted in less production Finally such strong government influence over labor could lead to an abuse of power favoring certain unions The results of these legislated regulations suggested to critics that associationalism tends to benefit labor the people directly at the cost of both corporate management and technological progress

 Theodore Roosevelt President 19011908 was the first true champion of American associationalism as evidenced by his intervention into the United Mine Workers strike of 1902 For the first time representatives from government labor and management met collectively and were able to resolve the conflict When management was uncooperative Roosevelt threatened to employ the military on behalf of labor to arrive at a resolution

Instead a fivemember commission was established to communicate with the company management Also wages were increased by ten percent and the length of the work day was cut from ten hours to nine keeping union membership sound By demonstrating a new role for the state in such conflicts aside from the previously held military positions associationalism took root in American society and politics and there wasnt another major coal strike in the country until the 1920s

Woodrow Wilson President 19131920 a regulatory liberal employed associationalism during World War I to control and regulate capital ensuring a steady flow of war supplies while minimizing the risk of breaks in manufacturing vital to the war effort The establishment of such government agencies as the National War Labor Board were instrumental in preventing strikes and ensuring collective bargaining In addition Wilson appointed the countrys first Secretary of Labor that was pro labor William B Wilson The policies were implemented as America successfully met its goals in wartime production There were nearly no strikes many companies saw enormous profits and the Allies won the war

Manual lymphatic drainage
Manual lymphatic drainage MLD is a type of massage based on an unproven hypothesis that it will encourage the natural drainage of the lymph which carries waste products away from the tissues back toward the heart The lymph system depends on intrinsic contractions of the smooth muscle cells in the walls of lymph vessels peristalsis and the movement of skeletal muscles to propel lymph through the vessels to lymph nodes and then to the lymph ducts which return lymph to the cardiovascular system Manual lymph drainage uses a specific amount of pressure less than 9 ounces per square inch or about 4 kPa and rhythmic circular movements to stimulate lymph flow Clinical studies of MLD conclude that further study of the practice is required before recommending it as an effective health treatment

Manual lymphatic drainage was pioneered by Danish Drs Emil Vodder and Estrid Vodder in the 1930s for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and other immune disorders While working on the French Riviera treating patients with chronic colds the Vodders noticed these patients had swollen lymph nodes In the 1930s the lymphatic system was poorly understood The Vodders were not deterred by this and in 1932 began to study the lymph system developing light rhythmic hand movements to promote lymph movement In 1936 they introduced this technique in Paris France and after World War II they returned to Copenhagen to teach other practitioners to use this therapy

Therapists can today receive certification through special classes conducted by various organizations specializing in MLD or through a complete lymphedema treatment certification course Scientific studies show mixed results regarding the efficacy of the method in treating lymphedema and further studies are needed A 2013 systematic review of manual lymphatic drainage with regard to breast cancer related lymphedema found no clear support for the effectiveness of the intervention in either preventing limb edema in atrisk women or treating women for the condition

La Navidad
La Navidad was a settlement that Christopher Columbus and his men established in presentday Haiti in 1492 from the remains of the Spanish ship the Santa Mara La Navidad was the first European colony established in the New World during the Age of Discovery though it was destroyed by the following year

Columbus sailed around the island of Hispaniola on Christmas Eve of 1492 during his first voyage One of his ships the Santa Mara drifted onto a bank and heeled over After hearing from Guacanagari that there was much gold to be had on the island Columbus decided that he would leave the crew of his wrecked vessel to make a settlement on the island and gather the promised gold He ordered the ship dismantled to provide the building materials for a small fortress

I have ordered a tower and fortress to be constructed and a large cellar not because I believe there is any necessity on account of the natives he noted in his journal I am certain the people I have with me could subjugate all this island as the population are naked and without arms and very cowardly

Columbus called the port Puerto de la Navidad Christmas Port the day he landed there He appointed Diego de Arana chief constable of the fleet and son of Rodrigo Pedro Gutirrez butler of the Spanish royal dais and Rodrigo de Escobedo to govern the fortress of 36 men They included carpenters calkers a physician a tailor and a gunner Additionally the settlement was supplied with provisions trading goods arms and artillery

On Friday 4 January 1493 Columbus set sail in the Nia in search of the third ship in the fleet the Pinta The Pinta was commanded by Martn Alonzo Pinzn and had been absent for six weeks On the night of 21 November the caravel Pinta had vanished into the darkness off the coast of Cuba and in his journal Columbus accused Pinzn of deliberately having separated the Pinta from the other ships in order to beat the admiral to the rich sources of gold which Columbus imagined were in the immediate area Even more disquieting was his fear that Pinzn might break for Spain in the fastsailing Pinta to be the first to bring news of the discovery to the Catholic Monarchs and to tell them lies about the admirals conduct of the expedition On Sunday morning 6 January 1493 the missing Pinta was spotted approaching from the east and after a heated argument between the two men the fleet returned to gather people and supplies for a return voyage

When Columbus returned to Navidad on 27 Nov 1493 his second voyage from Spain he found it burned to the ground    nobody in the vicinity In the fields nearby however he discovered the bodies of eight Christians Columbus later discovered that soon after his departure his men began to quarrel among themselves each taking as many women and as much gold as he could Gutirrez and Escobedo left with nine others along with their women for the gold mines However the lord of the mines turned killed them and then marched back to Navidad defended by Arana with ten others and Guacanagari Caonabo set fire to houses forcing Columbus men into the sea where eight drowned and three were killed onshore

Columbus decided to build a settlement further east in presentday Dominican Republic and named it La Isabela after Queen Isabella I

After Columbus sailed away a second time the site apparently was forgotten until a Haitian farmer led Dr William Hodges to a location in 1977 Hodges an amateur archaeologist and American medical missionary received permission from the Haitian government to excavate a tenniscourtsize section of the marshland and he and his helpers found some artifacts of La Navidad Despite the finds however no conclusive evidence has been discovered yet to pinpoint the exact location of La Navidad

<doc id="7718240" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7718240" title="Simon Fraser of Lovat">
Simon Fraser of Lovat
Simon Fraser of Lovat 19 October 1726  8 February 1782 was a son of a notorious Jacobite clan chief but he went on to serve with distinction in the British army He also raised forces which served in the Seven Years War against the French in Quebec as well as the American War of Independence Simon was the 19th Chief of the Clan Fraser of Lovat
Simons mother was Margaret Grant and his father Simon the Fox Fraser Lord Lovat chief of the Clan Fraser As the first born boy after several sisters he was his fathers heir and hence the Master of Lovat He grew up in the ancestral home of Castle Dounie near Beauly and was educated in Edinburgh and St Andrews University

Simon would not have had any concern in this rebellion had he been entirely left to himself according to one of his fathers secretaries of the period This was confirmed by another who noted that his father was a very strict man with great power over his children So at his fathers bidding Simon led his clansmen out in favour of Charles Edward Stuart in December 1745 

He was not present at the battle of Culloden Instead Charles Fraser of Inverallochy commanded about 300 Frasers who were in the front of the Jacobite lines and reached the British front line after a short charge However confronted with a second line of Hanoverian troops their impetus was lost and they retreated in some disorder leaving many dead and wounded behind 

There are various stories about the Master of Lovat at this moment in history One traditional story is that as the first of the Jacobites fleeing from Culloden approached Inverness they were met by a battalion of Frasers led by the Master of Lovat He immediately aboutturned his men and marched down the road back towards Inverness with pipes playing and colours A second story is that he intended to hold the bridge which spans the river Ness until he was persuaded against it In a third account recounted in The Last Highlander by Sarah Fraser he intended to continue on to the fight at Culloden moor but was scolded at the bridge by another Jacobite by the name of Evan Baillie Fighting by God Master You were not in the way when fighting might have been of service You had best say nothing of it now 
Following the Battle of Culloden after several weeks on the run Simon surrendered to the Crown and was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle from November 1746 to August 1747 He then remained in Glasgow at the kings pleasure where he studied law at Glasgow University

Simon received a full pardon in 1750 the same year he was called to the Scottish bar He burnished his establishment credentials by acting in 1752 as a counsel for the widow of Colin Roy Campbell against James Stewart in a notorious case known as the Appin Murder Stewart was a member of the local Jacobite clan the Stewarts of Appin who had recently suffered evictions on Campbells orders Stewart was found guilty of aiding and abetting by a jury composed largely of Campbells the presiding judge was the Campbell chief and Stewart was hanged

In 1753 he offered himself as a candidate for the forthcoming general election for Invernessshire which had a total of about 26 electors but the 3rd Duke of Argyll worried this might reignite feelings of clanship persuaded Fraser not to stand

Britains war with France in North America raised problems of recruitment and more in desperation than inspiration the government decided to recruit soldiers from the Highlands Simon whose hereditary title had been attainted following the FortyFive raised 800 men from the forfeited estate of his own family within a few weeks He was commissioned as a lieutenantcolonel and the regiment originally called the 78th Regiment of Foot was soon renamed the Fraser HighlandersThe uniform of the regiment was the full Highland dress with musket and broadsword and a sporran of badgers or otters skin An eagles or hawks feather was worn in their bonnets by the officers while the soldiers ornamented theirs with a bunch of the distinguishing mark of the clan or district to which they severally belongedThe regiment were sent to North America in 1757 and wintered in Halifax Nova Scotia Here Fraser fended off an attempt by his superiors to make the soldiers wear clothing thought more appropriate for the severe winters and hot summers of the continent Their unique national dress even enhanced their fighting qualities with one officer noting that alongside their bravery and their agility their dress contribute to adapt them to this climate and render them formidable

They fought with distinction against the French at the siege of Louisbourg in 1758 under the command of General Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in 1759 and at the capture of Montreal a year later

In 1762 Fraser left his regiment to serve in Portugal where he reached the temporary rank of majorgeneral in command of Portuguese forces against the Spanish The following year his regiment was disbanded whilst still in Canada and he was put on halfpay

At the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1775 General Fraser raised another regiment of two battalions known as the 71st Regiment of Foot informally known as the Fraser Highlanders although he did not accompany them to North America

In April 1761 the Duke of Argyll who had opposed Frasers standing for election died The next month Fraser was elected unopposed to the House of Commons seat of Invernessshire one day after his return from North America He was reelected three times and remained a representative until his death This is despite often being absent from the seat A history of the House of Commons for this period notes a brief visit in 1766 as well as his absence in Portugal in 1768 Indeed he may have been the British Ambassador there in this period since another source states he was representing the British Government in Lisbon in 1770

In 1774 the Lovat estates were restored to him but not the title This was a full decade before other forfeited estates were restored and was a measure of Frasers service for the Crown He nevertheless felt proud of his Scottish identity In 1778 he was the founding member and first president of the Highland Society of London Its overall aim was to promote the Interests of the Highlands with its particular goals being to repeal the ban on Highland dress being worn the promotion of Gaelic language music and literature establishing schools agricultural improvement the relief of distressed Highlanders and keeping up the Martial Spirit and rewarding the gallant achievements of the Highland Corps His half brother Archibald joined the Society in the same year

Fraser married Catherine Bristow but they had no children together He died in London in 1782 at the age of 56 His later life was marked by social respectability albeit with some debt to his name His halfbrother Archibald Campbell Fraser of Lovat succeeded him as the 20th MacShimidh or Chief of Clan Fraser

Simon Fraser appears twice in fiction but each time in an unflattering light He is a character in the novel Catriona written in 1893 by Robert Louis Stevenson Events and characters in the novel relate to the Appin Murder He also features as a character in Diana Gabaldons 1992 novel Dragonfly in Amber the second novel in her Outlander series In it Lovat is the grandfather of Jamie Fraser Lovat is played by James Parris in series 2 of the television series Outlander

The image of Fraser above may actually be of his halfbrother Archibald This is discussed at length on Archibalds Wikipedia page

In views of US army colonel John Adache the ISPR interfaces between the armed forces civil media and the civic society Furthermore the ISPR also formulates the media policy of the unified armed forces safeguards the military interests of the armed forces from negative influence and monitors international and domestic media reporting regarding its military issues

The ISPR directorate is staffed with combined personnel of Pakistans unified military along with civilian bureaucrats and officials The ISPR functioned at the JS HQ and responsible for garnering national support for the armed forces as well as strengthen their resolve to accomplish the assigned mission while undermining the will of the adversary

It also acts as an interface between the armed forces the media and the public It formulates much of the media policy of Pakistans military safeguards the armed forces from negative influences and monitors both international and domestic media

It is likely that the army is planning the further expansion of ISPR to counter negative propaganda against the state and armed forces by international powers and their funded domestic media campaigns in ongoing operation against terror outfits and economic terrorism
Thats why for the first time in its history ISPR was being led by a threestar general
LtGeneral Asim Saleem Bajwa

On regular basis the ISPR release televised press releases on regarding the ongoing military exercises and notified the civilian media about the ingenious strategic arsenal testings

Apart from functioning as the public relations body of the armed forces the ISPR handles exclusive dissemination of information regarding Pakistans ongoing military contingency operations

In recent years there have been accusations of ISPR going beyond its domain and meddling in media affairs to undermine democracy Concerns have been raised on ISPR handling media channels Bol TV Pak TV et al radio stations FM 8904 FM 9600  and several media personalities such as Dr Shahid Masood Arshad Sharif Sami Ibrahim Dr Aamir Liaqat etc to indoctrinate promilitary narrative

ISPR has regularly been criticized for posting inflammatory tweets on their official Twitter account In April 2017 Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor a BPS21 officer posted a tweet rejecting Prime Ministers directives to probe Dawn Leaks controversy After huge public outcry over the choice of words ISPR had to redact its earlier tweet

Similarly during Allama Khadim Rizvis Islamabad sitin a tweet was posted attributing COASs appeal to both sides to exercise restraint This was widely decried for equating peoples elected government against a mob further strengthening the belief that Army was behind the sitins to armtwist government

Since the 1990s the ISPR has been directing producing assisting in writings and funding the miniseries drama and films on military fiction Some of its highly acclaimed works include Alpha Bravo Charlie a television series on Pakistan Army directed by Shoaib Mansoor in 1990

Nicaea or Nikaia  was an ancient fortress of the Epicnemidian Locrians situated upon the sea and close to the pass of Thermopylae It is described by Aeschines as one of the places which commanded the pass It was the first Locrian town after Alpenos the latter being at the very entrance of the pass The surrender of Nicaea by Phalaecus to Philip II in 346 BCE made the Macedonian king master of Thermopylae and brought the Third Sacred War to an end Philip kept possession of it for some time but subsequently gave it to the Thessalians along with Magnesia But in 340 BCE we again find Nicaea in the possession of Philip According to Memnon of Heraclea Nicaea was destroyed by the Phocians and its inhabitants founded Bithynian Nicaea But even if this is true the town must have been rebuilt soon afterwards since we find it in the hands of the Aetolians during the Roman wars in Greece Subsequently the town is only mentioned by Strabo ix p426 William Martin Leake identifies Nicaea with the castle of Mendenitsa where there are Hellenic remains

Gospel magic
Gospel magic is the use of otherwise standard stage magic tricks and illusions to promote Christian messages Gospel magic does not claim to invoke spirits or paranormal powers Gospel magic is intended to present the Christian good news through visual parables the trick or illusion is used to present theological points in an entertaining way with the intention that people will remember the message Gospel magic is generally presented as stage magic or platform magic but it can be adapted to closeup magic or micromagic situations

The first modern use of Gospel magic is in the ministry of the Italian Catholic priest Giovanni Melchiorre Bosco Don Bosco 18151888 His autobiography lists many dozens of magic tricks used for the purpose of offering religious instruction to children and youth
Don Bosco has been seen as the Patron Saint of Catholic Magicians and specifically Catholic Gospel Magicians

In 1910 C H Woolston published Seeing Truth Object Lessons with Magical and Mechanical Effects which aimed to help adults working with children in church Other texts were soon written that incorporated Gospel messages with magic

In 1953 the International Fellowship of Christian Magicians began in the USA This rapidly spread the use of the creative arts to teach the Gospel Many Gospel Performers dealers and authors made their first attempts at magic under their tuition There are now chapters in many US and Canadian cities as well as in the UK Germany and Hong Kong An International magazine is published The Voice of the FCM every two months Annual Conventions are held in USA UK and Germany

The word magic never appears in the Bible Daniel is called the chief of the magicians or master of the magicians Daniel 49 The Bible condemns sorcery astrology speaking to spirits and witchcraft but never does it condemn magic

The arts have long been used to present Christian teachings Icons parables music song dance poetry sculpture painting stained glass theater radio film television the Internet stage magic and illusion have all been used Today this often includes storytelling drama puppetry ventriloquism balloonmodelling and juggling

Wellknown and influential gospel magicians include Duane Laflin Dennis Regling  Andre Kole Dock Haley and Brad Brown


These books are based on the Tarbell Course a standard for stage magicians preWorld War II It was originally intended to be expanded to cover all eightvolumes in the Tarbell Series but Miller died before this project was completed This work is slowly being completed by other magicians unofficially

Battle of Afabet
The Battle of Afabet was fought from March 17 through 20 March 1988 in and around the town of Afabet as part of the Eritrean War of Independence

The Nadew Command was one of four commands or army corps of the Ethiopian Second Revolutionary Army Led by Colonel Getaneh Haile it was composed of three infantry divisions and accompanying support units and some sources state it had between 20000 and 22000 soldiers Gebru Tareke noting that the morale of the soldiers was at an alltime low and none of the divisions had even half of the numbers that would normally constitute an Ethiopian division  ten to twelve thousand men quotes Ministry of Defense reports to state that there were 15223 men in the three divisions

The Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front EPLF had attacked the Nadew Command a few months previously with limited success On 8 December 1987 the EPLF had attacked one of the divisions of the Command the Twentysecond with a force that may have contained as many as five infantry brigades one mechanized battalion and three heavyweapon battalions On the second day of the assault Eritrean infiltrators destroyed the divisional control center It required the assistance of the Nineteenth Mountain Infantry Division and the 45th Infantry Brigade to halt further advances and repel the EPLF forces Ethiopian losses in this preliminary engagement were 842 killed 291 wounded and 615 missing Eritrean losses have been estimated at 125 killed and 269 wounded However the Ethiopian side suffered even graver losses in the aftermath on Mengistu Haile Mariams order twenty senior officers were transferred and the commander of the Nadew Command General Tariku Ayne who had been absent from Afabet for medical treatment was executed outside of Asmara on 15 February 1988 The death of one of Ethiopias most prominent generals surprised even the EPLF whose Radio of the Masses broadcast that the Derg had cut off its right hand with its left hand The Twentysecond Division was moved to Keren and replaced with the Fourteenth Infantry Division

By midMarch 1988 the Nadew Command had planned to launch an offensive campaign against the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front EPLF however they were preempted by the EPLF

On the morning of March 17 1988 the EPLF deployed troops on three sides around Hedai Valley to encircle the Ethiopian garrison The first unit attacked was the newly arrived Fourteenth Division Upon their attack the Ethiopian forces began to withdraw but were cut off The battle continued while the Ethiopian garrison from Keren tried to reinforce their position which was thwarted by the EPLF

A stumbling block for the EPLF was on the left flank where their Eightyfifth Division was held up by the dogged resistance of the Ethiopian Twentyninth Mechanized Brigade It fought without reinforcement for most of a day until its commander gambled on a retreat to Afabet Lacking time for careful reconnaissance before its withdraw the brigade was halted when a tank and truck were disabled by Eritrean 100mm guns the burning vehicles blocking the road The Ethiopians were forced to destroy their weaponry to prevent them from falling into EPLF hands Ethiopian aircraft even bombed their own troops The commander of the Second Revolutionary Army came to the battlefield himself to supervise opening the road to Afabet until he allegedly escaped on a camel wearing a womans clothes through the south eastern part of Afabet just before the fall of the garrison Once the Ethiopian troops were routed in Hedai Valley the EPLF stormed and captured Afabet As the town was a major garrison the EPLF also captured a large cache of weapons in addition to those captured in the valley

Killion estimates that by the end of the threeday battle the Eritreans had killed or captured over 18000 Ethiopian soldiers One Ethiopian to survive the battle was the commander of the Nadew Command Colonel Getaneh Haile who had fought his way to Keren with a single tank and four armored cars The colonel thanked God for his escape Gebru Tareke laconically comments that the deities were not as kind to most of his men who remained trapped in the town

Not long after this defeat Berhane Woldemichael wrote in the periodical Review of African Political Economy

The victory over the Nadew Command is considered by the historian Basil Davidson to be the most significant victory for any liberation movement since the Vietnamese victory at Dien Bien Phu It has also been described as the largest battle in Africa since El Alamein However the Ethiopian historian Gebru Tareke disagrees with this comparison to Dien Bien Phu pointing out that Davidson made his observation from the field as a guest of the EPLF and that the Ethiopian armed forces continued to fight at times quite vigorously for another three years He concludes From a global perspective Afabet was an event whereas Dien Bien Phu was eventful

John F Curry
Major General John Francis Curry April 22 1886  March 4 1973 was the first national commander of the Civil Air Patrol the United States Air Force Auxiliary He was also a major general in the United States Army Air Corps

Curry had learned to fly in time to accompany General John J Pershings expedition to Mexico Later during World War I he served as Chief of Staff of the Air Service of the Second Army in France under Col Frank P Lahm On October 26 1918 while serving as an observer in a 135th Aero Squadron airplane the DH4 was shot down by antiaircraft fire he and his pilot escaped capture On November 3 1918 while still serving as an observer his planealong with an aircraft of the 168th Aero Squadrondestroyed a German observation balloon

In late 1941 there was significant interest by civilian pilots to assist the US military However in Washington DC those in authority scoffed at the idea that a group of nonmilitary aviators could provide any such assistance Despite these misgivings the Civil Air Patrol was formed as a part of the United States home defense needs Curry an Army Air Corps officer was selected as its first national commander As such he was the nations only acting general in command of a civilian army He served in this capacity from December 1941 to March 1942

Founded as a volunteer organization the Civil Air Patrol conducted patrols over coastal waters in search of enemy submarines and naval activity As it was not a governmentsponsored plan to provide free flight training each individual had to pay for their own flying time

Part of the reason for the founding of the Civil Air Patrol was to keep aviation from being put aside entirely during the war As Gen Curry stated Without such a plan as Civil Air Patrol there might be no private aviation for the duration of the war with such a plan there is a chance that private flying may continue and develop Under Currys guidance wings were formed in every state He helped mobilize 100000 private pilots for noncombatant service thus freeing military pilots for wartime duty

There was no discrimination because of ones gender Individual ability experience and past records were the main criteria for selection In Currys words There must be no doubt in the minds of out gallant women fliers that they are needed and in my opinion indispensable to the full success of the Civil Air Patrol organization A great part of the progress made in organizing civilian aviation under Civil Air Patrol has been due to the volunteer help given by women flyers Although he only served a few months as national commander Gen Currys organizational skills were influential in determining the future growth of the Civil Air Patrol

Originally the Civil Air Patrol was given the opportunity to prove itself for a 90day test period Success in deterring German Uboat attacks on merchant vessels encouraged the USAAF and USN to support the Civil Air Patrols coastal patrol mission among others After the end of World War II the Civil Air Patrol continued to serve the nation in performance of dangerous missions The Colorado Wing Civil Air Patrol and Colorado State Director of Aeronautics headed now by retired Maj Gen John F Curry conducted light plane surveys through the rugged Colorado Rocky Mountains Where more than 50 peaks have an elevation of greater than  scores of flying individuals lost their lives due to unpredictable winds As a result of Currys direction maps of safe flying routes were developed by Colorado Civil Air Patrol personnel

The first Civil Air Patrol cadet achievement the General J F Curry Achievement is named in his honor

AlYarmouk SC Kuwait
AlYarmouk is a Kuwaiti professional sports club located in the district of Mishref It was established on 28 February 1965 in Failaka Island and was the only Kuwaiti club to have been established outside mainland Kuwait at that time The club was relocated to mainland Kuwait after the 19901991 Gulf War which resulted in the displacement of many inhabitants belonging to Failakas island settlements Therefore due to inadequate facilities after the liberation of Kuwait it was inevitable that the team had to move to a better and more sustainable location Other reasons aside the Gulf War for the relocation of the club was due to the insufficient means of transportation for teams and players to travel to Failaka Island for away matches during the regular season

Al Yarmouk is mostly famous for its football team which gave rise to a plethora of talented Kuwaiti football players during the course of its history The club has only achieved 4 trophies since it was first established 2 of which were the Prince Cups in 1970 and 1973 which is usually regarded as the most prestigious and important trophy in Kuwaiti football The other 2 trophy achievements were the Second division titles won in 1968 and 1989

Al Yarmouk sports club went through a major renovation project since 2006 as part of a grand scheme to regenerate interest within the local Mishref community A new stadium was built and is also planned for a second phase of renovation Al Yarmouk also built new swimming facilities as well as an indoor arena for basketball handball volleyball and other indoor sports such as table tennis A track and field team is also widely financed from the clubs department There is also an extra outdoor football field for training and for youth matches

The Mishref stadium is planned to be an allseater and there are also plans to make seating expansions and a roof around all the stands

The clubs main two colors are navy blue and white representing the sea which was a major part of Failaka Islands culture The logo represents the ancient Greek ruins located in Failaka Island also known as Ikaros during the times of Alexander the Great Al Yarmouk club have since used this logo and color as a representation of their potential strength to success

The club isnt as popular as Kuwaits big five elite Kuwait SC AlArabi SC Qadsia SC Kazma SC and Salmiya SC however it is usually supported primarily by people in the surrounding area of the clubs location Prior to the Gulf War it was supported by the local inhabitants of Failaka Island After its relocation however it shifted away from Failakas fanbase and is now attracting fans mostly from the Mishref residential area although it also attracts supporters from other nearby areas such as Salwa and Bayan

People expect Al Yarmouk to have a bright and successful future with its ambitious new board



The idea of initiating a club based in the island of Failaka began in 1963 when a group of local footballers wanted to officially join the Kuwaiti football association and start participating in its respective competitions The club was to represent the local inhabitants of Failaka The club was officially declared on 28 February 1965 and was formally conceived by the Kuwaiti football association board on 7 March 1965

The name of the club roots back to the legendary Islamic battle of Al Yarmouk which took place near the Yarmouk River now the border between Jordan and Syria between ArabMuslims and ByzantineChristians The reason why this name was chosen is that Al Yarmouk holds various Greek ruins which reminded the local people of the Byzantine Empire and how strongly it influenced Northern Arabia before Islamic times making them appreciate the battle of Yarmouk thus deciding on naming it after the battle which resulted in the triumph of Muslims over Christians The club badgeemblem represents a reminder of Failakas history as Ikarus the name given to it by the ancient Macedonians during Alexander the Greats reign over this region and his establishments in the island which is reflected today by the appearance of many old Greek ruins

Michigans 7th congressional district
Michigans 7th congressional district is a United States congressional district in Southern Michigan From 2004 to 2013 it consisted of all of Branch Eaton Hillsdale Jackson and Lenawee counties and included most of Calhoun and a large portion of western and northern Washtenaw counties The district shifted east in the 2012 redistricting and now includes the western suburbs of Ann Arbor and Monroe County

In the November 2 2010 midterm elections Republican Tim Walberg defeated Mark Schauer the districts previous congressman

Michigan has 14 congressional districts and Michigans law on redistricting states that the district at the southeasternmost corner of the state must be the highest numbered district However the 7th district despite being containing the southeasternmost corner of the state is not the highest numbered district


The 7th Congressional district was formed in 1872 covering the Thumb of Michigan It had Tuscola Huron Sanilac Lapeer St Clair and Macomb Counties In 1882 Tuscola County was removed from the district but everything else remained the same In 1892 Grosse Point and Hamtramck Townships the latter one today mainly within the city boundaries of Detroit were moved into the 7th District

In 1912 Tuscola county was put back in the 7th district but it may have lost its Wayne County areas It was definitely deprived of these areas by 1932

In 1964 the 7th district experienced its most drastic redistricting yet Only Lapeer County was retained from the old district while Genesee County was added In 1972 the district was redrawn again losing Lapeer County as well as a few outlying parts of Genesee County In 1982 most of Lapeer county was put back in the 7th district The northern tier of townships in Genesee County were moved to the 8th district Burns Township in Shiawasee County and all the northern tier of townships in Oakland County with the exception of Brandon Township were also put in the district

After 1992 this old 7th district constituted a large part of the new 9th district

The current 7th has no connection with the pre1992 seventh congressional district If populations and not just areas are considered it is primarily an heir of the previous 3rd district Most of the area came from the old 2nd district and some of John Dingells old 16th district was also included

All of Eaton and Calhoun Counties were preserved from the 3rd to the 7th district Half of the area of Barry County that had been in the old 3rd was retained From the old 4th was drawn most of Branch County The rest of Branch County and Hillsdale County the southwestern portion of Washtenaw County and western Lenawee County and most of Jackson County were taken from the old 2nd district Even though most of the area of the old second was put in the new 7th most of its population was moved into the 13th From Ann Arbor to Plymouth Livonia and Northville The portion of Lenawee County that had been in the 16th was absorbed and a small part of the Washtenaw County area of the 15th district and the part of the old 6th that had been in Jackson County Thus the new 7th district incorporated areas from six old districts

The 2002 redistricting is best seen as a shift from the 3rd district to the 2nd district legacy With the loss of its quadrant in Barry County and a small section of Calhoun County the district lost affinity to the 3rd of yore It took back the portion of Washtenaw County that had been lost to the 8th district and shed the part of Washtenaw County that had come from the old 15th district Although none of Wayne County was included in the new district it did have Salem Township which not only borders Wayne County but is largely in a Wayne Countyheadquartered school district

In the 2012 redistricting the district gained Monroe County as well as the portion of Washtenaw County around Saline

Nepalese scripts
The expression Nepalese Scripts refers to alphabetic writing systems employed historically in Nepala Mandala by the indigenous Newars for primarily writing Nepalbhasa and for transcribing Sanskrit There are also some claims they have also been used to write the Parbatiya Khas language but all Pahari languages were traditionally written with the Takri alphabet and now Devanagari

The older alphabets known as Nepal Lipi or Nepal script were in widespread use from the 10th to the early 20thcentury ACE but have since been largely supplanted by the modern script known as Devanagari Of the older scripts about 50000 manuscripts written in Nepal Lipi have been archived

Outside of Nepal Brahmi scripts also have been used to write Sanskrit Hindi Maithili Bengali and Braj Bhasha languages They have reportedly been used to inscribe mantras on funerary markers as distant as Japan as well

Nepal or Nepalese script appeared in the 10th century The earliest instance is a manuscript entitled Lankavatara Sutra dated Nepal Era 28 908 AD Another early specimen is a palmleaf manuscript of a Buddhist text the Prajnaparamita dated Nepal Era 40 920 AD One of the oldest manuscript of Ramayana preserved till date was written in Nepal Script in 1041

The script has been used on stone and copper plate inscriptions coins Nepalese mohar palmleaf documents and Hindu and Buddhist manuscripts

Among the different scripts based on Nepal script Ranjana meaning delightful Bhujinmol flyheaded and Prachalit ordinary are the most common

Ranjana is the most ornate among the scripts It is most commonly used to write Buddhist texts and inscribe mantras on prayer wheels shrines temples and monasteries The popular Buddhist mantra Om mani padme hum meaning Hail to the jewel in the lotus in Sanskrit is often written in Ranjana

Besides the Kathmandu Valley and the Himalayan region in Nepal the Ranjana script is used for sacred purposes in Tibet China Japan Korea Mongolia Bhutan Sikkim and Ladakh

The Jokhang Temple in Lhasa Tibet is ornamented with mantras embossed in Ranjana script and the panels under the eaves are numbered using Nepal Lipi

Among the famed historical texts written in Nepal Lipi are Gopalarajavamsavali a history of Nepal which appeared in 1389 AD the NepalTibet treaty of Nepal Era 895 1775 AD and a letter dated Nepal Era 535 1415 AD sent by Chinese Emperor Tai Ming to Shaktisimharama a feudatory of Banepa

The different scripts derived from Nepal script are as follows


Nepalese scripts saw a widespread use for a thousand years in Nepal In 1906 the Rana regime banned Nepal Bhasa Nepal Era and Nepal Lipi from official use as part of its policy to subdue them and the script fell into decline

Authors were also encouraged to switch to Devanagari to write Nepal Bhasa because of the availability of moveable type for printing and Nepal Lipi was pushed further into the background However the script continued to be used for religious and ceremonial purposes till the 1950s

After the Rana dynasty was overthrown and democracy established in 1951 restrictions on Nepal Bhasa were lifted Attempts were made to study and revive the old scripts and alphabet books were published Hemraj Shakyavamsha published an alphabet book of 15 types of Nepalese alphabets including Ranjana Bhujimol and Pachumol

In 1952 a pressman Pushpa Ratna Sagar of Kathmandu had moveable type of Nepal script made in India The metal type was used to print the dateline and the titles of the articles in Thaunkanhe monthly

In 1989 the first book to be printed using a computer typeface of Nepal script Prasiddha Bajracharyapinigu Sanchhipta Bibaran Profiles of Renowned Bajracharyas by Badri Ratna Bajracharya was published

Today Nepal Lipi has gone out of general usage but it is sometimes used in signage invitation and greeting cards letterheads book and CD covers product labels and the mastheads of newspapers A number of private organizations are engaged in its study and promotion

Nepal Lipi with the name Newa was approved for inclusion in Unicode 90

<doc id="7718798" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7718798" title="Progressive folk">
Progressive folk
Progressive folk was originally a type of American folk music that pursued a progressive political agenda but in the United Kingdom the term became attached to a musical subgenre The latter describes a substyle of contemporary folk that draws from postBob Dylan folk music and adds new layers of musical and lyrical complexity often incorporating various ethnic influences

The original meaning of progressive folk came from its links to the progressive politics of the American folk revival of the 1930s particularly through the work of musicologist Charles Seeger Key figures in the development of progressive folk in America were Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie who influenced figures such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez in the 1960s All mixed progressive political messages with traditional folk music tunes and themes

In Britain one of the major strands that emerged from the shortlived skiffle craze of 19569 were acoustic artists who performed American progressive material Vital in the development of progressive folk was the emergence of the American counterculture and British underground scenes of the mid1960s The term progressive began to be used by radio stations to describe psychedelic music including pop rock and folk that emerged from this scene

The first musical use of the term psychedelic is thought to have been by the New Yorkbased folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Hesitation Blues a popular blues standard in 1964 Psychedelic music spread rapidly in the beat folk scenes of both the east and west coast of the mid1960s San Francisco produced bands such as Kaleidoscope Its a Beautiful Day and Peanut Butter Conspiracy From New York citys Greenwich Village came groups such as Jake and the Family Jewels and Cat Mother  the All Night Newsboys Chicagos major contribution was H P Lovecraft Many of these psychedelic folk groups followed the Byrds into folk rock from 1965 are now as a result more widely remembered including Jefferson Airplane Grateful Dead and Quicksilver Messenger Service

From the mid1960s partly as a result of the British Invasion this trend ran in parallel in both America and Britain and as part of the interrelated folk folk rock and rock scenes Folk artists who were particularly significant included the Scottish performers Donovan who combined influences of American artists like Bob Dylan with references to flower power and the Incredible String Band who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences into their acoustic based music including medieval and eastern instruments There was a brief flowering of British and Irish progressive folk in the late 1960s and early 1970s with groups like the Third Ear Band and Quintessence following the eastern Indian musical and more abstract work by group such as Comus Dando Shaft Trees Spyrogyra Forest and Jan Dukes De Grey

The situation in Britain was made more complex by the second folk revival which created a network of folk clubs across the country mostly in urban centres from the late 1950s In the early 1960s much of the music performed in these venues was American traditional and progressive folk but this was increasingly discouraged from the mid1960s as British traditional music began to dominate policy clubs Most psychedelic folk artists particularly in London relied more heavily on coffee houses and clubs like UFO and Middle Earth as their venues but a number of artists occupied a musical territory between traditional and progressive music This was particularly notable with artists like Davy Graham Martin Carthy Bert Jansch and John Renbourn who fused various styles of American music with English folk to create a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque Using medieval jazz and blues elements in their playing this was an overt attempt to push British folk music into new territory and can be seen as a forerunner of progressive rock Perhaps the finest individual work in the genre was from early 1970s artists like Nick Drake Tim Buckley and John Martyn

Country folk emerged as a hybrid subgenre of progressive folk and country after Dylans visit to Nashville to record Blonde on Blonde in 1966 Developing as a gentler form of country with more emphasis on song writing it continued some of the political traditions of progressive folk being taken up in the 1970s by artists such as John Denver and Emmylou Harris and more recently contributing to the development of the progressive country subgenre

In the early 1970s psychedelia began to fall out of fashion and those folk groups that had not already moved into different areas had largely disbanded Although artists like Dylan and Baez continued their careers with considerable success in the 1970s as American folk music began to fragment with groups focusing on areas such as blues bluegrass and oldtime progressive folk began to disappear as a term and its major themes shifted into contemporary folk focusing on new singersongwriters using the coffeehouse circuit including such artists as Chris Castle Steve Goodman and John Prine

In Britain folk groups also tended to electrify as did acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex which became the electric combo T Rex This was a continuation of a process by which progressive folk had considerable impact on mainstream rock Others probably influenced by the British folk rock pioneered by Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span from 1969 moved towards more traditional material a category including Dando Shaft Amazing Blondel and Jack the Lad an offshoot of northern progressive folk group Lindisfarne Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock were the short lived but later reunited Comus and more successfully Renaissance who combined folk and rock with classical elements In the early 2010s the band Moulettes was one of the most prominent progressive folk artists in the United Kingdom

Languages of Indonesia
More than 700 living languages are spoken in Indonesia A major part of them belong to the Austronesian language family while over 270 Papuan nonAustronesian languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia The official language is Indonesian locally known as bahasa Indonesia a standardized form of Malay which serves as the lingua franca of the archipelago The vocabulary of Indonesian borrows heavily from regional languages of Indonesia such as Javanese Sundanese and Minangkabau as well as from Dutch Sanskrit and Arabic 

The Indonesian language is primarily used in commerce administration education and the media Most Indonesians speak other languages such as Javanese as their first language Most books printed in Indonesia are written in the Indonesian language

Since Indonesia recognises only a single official language other languages are not recognised either at the national level or the regional level thus making Javanese the most widely spoken language without official status with Sundanese the second in the list excluding Chinese varieties

Below is a chart of several Indonesian languages Most of them belong to Austronesian languages family While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as languages and which ones should be classified as dialects the chart confirms that most have similarities yet are not mutually comprehensible These languages are arranged according to the numbers of native speakers

There are 726 languages spoken across the Indonesian archipelago in 2009 dropped from 742 languages in 2007 the largest multilingual population in the world only after Papua New Guinea Indonesian Papua which is adjacent to Papua New Guinea has the most languages in Indonesia Based on the EGIDS classification used by Ethnologue formerly the Summer Institute of Linguistics 63 languages are dying shown in red on the bar chart subdivided into Moribund and Nearly Extinct or Dormant which is defined as The only fluent users if any are older than childbearing age so it is too late to restore natural intergenerational transmission through the home

Indonesias Minister of Education and Culture Muhammad Nuh affirmed in January 2013 that the teaching of local languages as school subjects will be part of the national education curriculum Nuh stated that much of the public worry about the teaching of local languages being left out of the curriculum is misplaced and that the new curriculum will be conveyed to them

Despite the Dutch presence in Indonesia for almost 350years parts of Indonesia were ruled by the Dutch East India Company and subsequently the whole of what is now Indonesia was in the Dutch East Indies the Dutch language has no official status there and the small minority that can speak the language fluently are either educated members of the oldest generation or employed in the legal profession as certain law codes are still only available in Dutch

Several prominent languages spoken in Indonesia sorted by language family are


There are many additional small families and isolates among the Papuan languages


Indonesian languages are generally not rendered in nativeinvented systems but in scripts devised by speakers of other languages that is Tamil Arabic and Latin Malay for example has a long history as a written language and has been rendered in Brahmic Arabic and Latin scripts Javanese has been written in the Pallava script of South India as well as their derivative known as Kawi and Javanese in an Arabic alphabet called pegon that incorporates Javanese sounds and in the Latin script

Chinese characters have never been used to write Indonesian languages although Indonesian placenames personal names and names of trade goods appear in reports and histories written for Chinas imperial courts

Mansquito
Mansquito also known as Mosquitoman is a 2005 American madefortelevision monster movie directed by Tibor Takcs and stars Corin Nemec Musetta Vander and Matt Jordon It shares many similarities with the 1986 adaptation of The Fly and was conceived by Ray Cannella Manager of Program Acquisition for the Syfy Channel He and other two colleagues began producing films for the channel feeling that they could do better than the films they bought from independent producers

Dr Jennifer Allen Musetta Vander in Baltimore Maryland wants to find a cure for a disease known as the Gillen virus a disease similar to yet more deadly than the Fire Rising virus She and a colleague capture infected mosquitoes and give them small doses of radiation She explains that the levels have to be exact because if the mosquitoes receive too much radiation the results could be more devastating than the virus itself

A convict named Ray Erikson Matt Jordan joins Dr Allens program in exchange for his lifelong prison sentence He takes a hostage and convinces Dr Allen to open the door to the experiment room The security guards open fire and cause an explosion that showers Ray and Dr Allen with the chemicals and the genetically altered mosquitoes Ray manages to flee the scene

He begins to transform into the titular monster a deformed chimera half man half mosquito yet he manages to find his way to his exgirlfriends apartment where the process continues When the ex comes home she finds it in ruins She and Ray have a short anxious conversation before Rays transformation is complete and he kills her

Meanwhile Dr Allen returns home with her boyfriend Baltimore Police Lieutenant Tom Randall Corin Nemec That evening she notices her wrist is red and rawlooking She thinks little of it but by the next morning it has spread to her entire arm Later while kissing Tom she has a sudden craving for blood and bites him He is called to Rays girlfriends apartment and leaves Dr Allen rushes into the bathroom to find her arm bleeding She convulses falls to the floor and her skin starts to bubble

Tom arrives at the crime scene and is puzzled by the way Rays girlfriend died He is called to investigate another crime scene where he encounters Mansquito The monster seems unstoppable until Tom shocks him with a stun gun making him flee in pain Toms partner doesnt believe him at first but puts a bulletin out on the creature

At the research station Dr Allen discovers she is also changing into a humanmosquito hybrid but more slowly as she received a smaller dose than Ray Mansquito appears but doesnt try to kill her and after she faints the monster leaves Tom takes her to the hospital

The doctor wants to give Dr Allen a blood transfusion to slow down the transformation but she replies that nothing can stop the mutation She believes the monster sensed that she is turning into a creature like him and that once the transformation is complete he will want to mate with her Outside a guard falls victim to the monster and Tom leaves to investigate Mansquito undergoes another transformation this time growing wings

Dr Allen also undergoes another transformation and alerts the officers of Mansquitos arrival They fail to stop him The monster heads for Dr Allen but she manages to escape Tom fires a rocket launcher at the oxygen tanks behind Mansquito and assumes the creature was killed by the explosion but that is not the case

Meanwhile back at the lab Dr Allen undergoes yet another transformation and releases the last batch of genetically altered mosquitoes which have been perfected Tom arrives and Dr Allen tells him that Mansquito is still alive She tries to commit suicide by stabbing herself with a syringe because without a mate Mansquito will die

The monster arrives and Tom fights him to no avail Dr Allen is seriously injured by Mansquito who is now focused on killing her rather than mating with her Tom uses the stun gun and once again it works Seeing this Dr Allen breaks an electrical line and electrocutes Mansquito sacrificing herself Tom writes a report about the incident and the Gillen virus is wiped out by the altered mosquitoes

The film was released on DVD by Millennium on May 17 2005

Dread Central awarded the film a score of 3 out of 5 Noting the films shortcomings and rudimentary plot but complimented the films creature design and gore effects stating Mansquito is a fun throwback to the bmovies of yore thats more entertaining than it has any right to be Perhaps it was just dumb luck or maybe the law of averages finally caught up with them but the SciFi Channel finally produced a winner Chris Carle from IGN gave the film a negative review calling it a lurching mess of silly logic odd casting bad CG and 1960s Japanquality monster suit effects HorrorNewsnet while noting the films faults the reviewer felt that the makers did a decent enough job with the film to make it enjoyable Felix Vasquez from Cinema Crazed gave the film a mostly positive review writing This is another one of those so bad theyre good films with a really ridiculous concept but overall you cant help but like it a lot With some great special effects good gore hilarious moments and bad acting you cant take this too seriously Enter with an open mind and youll enjoy it like I did David Cornelius from eFilmCritic awarded the film 25 stars writing It pains me to say that none of this is nearly as fun as it should have been Any movie with a plot this insane must by all accounts be either outrageously stupid or deliciously selfconsciously entertaining Mansquito is neither Aside from a few moments of uncontrollable idiocy mostly involving the grand miscasting of nice guy Nemic as badass cop theres very little here that manages to do anything other than bore

<doc id="7718899" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7718899" title="HLAA">
HLAA
HLAA is a group of human leukocyte antigens HLA that are coded for by the HLAA locus which is located at human chromosome 6p213 HLA is a major histocompatibility complex MHC antigen specific to humans HLAA is one of three major types of human MHC class I cell surface receptors The others are HLAB and HLAC The receptor is a heterodimer and is composed of a heavy  chain and smaller  chain The  chain is encoded by a variant HLAA gene and the  chain microglobulin is an invariant  microglobulin molecule The  microglobulin protein is coded for by a separate region of the human genome

MHC Class I molecules such as HLAA are part of a process that presents short polypeptides to the immune system These polypeptides are typically 711 amino acids in length and originate from proteins being expressed by the cell There are two classes of polypeptide that can be presented by an HLA protein those that are supposed to be expressed by the cell self and those of foreign derivation nonself Under normal conditions cytotoxic T cells which normally patrol the body in the blood read the peptide presented by the complex T cells if functioning properly only bind to nonself peptides If binding occurs a series of events is initiated culminating in cell death via apoptosis In this manner the human body eliminates any cells infected by a virus or expressing proteins they shouldnt be eg cancerous cells

For humans as in most mammalian populations MHC Class I molecules are extremely variable in their primary structure and HLAA is ranked among the genes in humans with the fastestevolving coding sequence As of December 2013 there are 2432 known HLAA alleles coding for 1740 active proteins and 117 null proteins This level of variation on MHC Class I is the primary cause of transplant rejection as random transplantation between donor and host is unlikely to result in a matching of HLAA B or C antigens Evolutionary biologists also believe that the wide variation in HLAs is a result of a balancing act between conflicting pathogenic pressures Greater variety of HLAs decreases the probability that the entire population will be wiped out by a single pathogen as certain individuals will be highly resistant to each pathogen The effect of HLAA variation on HIVAIDS progression is discussed below

The HLAA gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 and encodes the larger chain constituent of HLAA Variation of HLAA chain is key to HLA function This variation promotes genetic diversity in the population Since each HLA has a different affinity for peptides of certain structures greater variety of HLAs means greater variety of antigens to be presented on the cell surface enhancing the likelihood that a subset of the population will be resistant to a given foreign invader This decreases the likelihood that a single pathogen has the capability to wipe out the entire human population

Each individual can express up to two types of HLAA one from each of their parents Some individuals will inherit the same HLAA from both parents decreasing their individual HLA diversity however the majority of individuals will receive two different copies of HLAA This same pattern follows for all HLA groups In other words every single person can only express either one or two of the 2432 known HLAA alleles

All HLAs are assigned a name by the World Health Organization Naming Committee for Factors of the HLA System This name is organized to provide the most information about the particular allele while keeping the name as short as possible An HLA name looks something like this

HLAA02010102L

All alleles receive at least a four digit classification HLAA0212 The A signifies which HLA gene the allele belongs to There are many HLAA alleles so that classification by serotype simplifies categorization The next pair of digits indicates this assignment For example HLAA0202 HLAA0204 and HLAA02324 are all members of the A2 serotype designated by the 02 prefix This group is the primary factor responsible for HLA compatibility All numbers after this cannot be determined by serotyping and are designated through gene sequencing The second set of digits indicates what HLA protein is produced These are assigned in order of discovery and as of December 2013 there are 456 different HLAA02 proteins known assigned names HLAA0201 to HLAA02456 The shortest possible HLA name includes both of these details Each extension beyond that signifies synonymous mutations within the coding region and mutations outside the coding region The interpretation of the extensions is covered in greater detail in current HLA naming system

The protein coded for by the HLAA gene is 365 amino acids long and weighs roughly 41000 Daltons Da It contains 8 exons 

The HLAA signal peptide is a series of hydrophobic amino acids present at the Nterminus of the protein that directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum where the remaining seven domains are translated The three  domains form the binding groove that holds a peptide for presentation to CD8 tcells The transmembrane region is the region that is embedded in the phospholipid bilayer surrounding the ER lumen The HLAA protein is a singlepass transmembrane protein In other words the first four domains of the protein are inside the ER lumen while the last three domains are present outside the lumen giving the protein the orientation required for proper function The last three domains of the protein form a tail of primarily sheets that remains in the cells cytosol
Once the HLAA protein is completely translated it must be folded into the proper shape A molecular chaperone protein called calnexin and an enzyme called ERp57 assist in the folding process Calnexin holds the HLAA heavy chain while Erp57 catalyzes disulfide bonds between the heavy chain and the light microglobulin chain This bond induces a conformational change in the heavy chain forming the binding groove Calnexin then dissociates with the complex now referred to as a peptide loading complex and is replaced by calreticulin another chaperone protein Short peptides are continually transported from around the cell into the ER lumen by a specialized transport protein called TAP TAP then binds to the peptide loading complex along with another protein called tapasin At this point the peptide loading complex consists of HLAA heavy chain microglobulin light chain an ERp57 enzyme calreticulin chaperone protein TAP with a bound peptide fragment and tapasin Tapasin increases the stability of TAP in addition to stabilizing the entire peptide loading complex At this point TAP releases the peptide it transported into the ER lumen The proximity of the HLAA binding groove to TAP is ensured by the peptide loading complex This increases the likelihood that the peptide will find the groove If the peptides affinity for the HLAA protein is great enough it binds in the groove Research suggests that tapasin may actively load peptides from TAP into the HLAA complex while also holding class I molecules in the ER lumen until a high affinity peptide has been bound

After a peptide of high enough affinity has bonded to the class I MHC calreticulin ERp57 TAP and tapasin release the molecule At this point the class I complex consists of an HLAA protein bonded to a microglobulin and a short peptide It is still anchored in the ER membrane by the transmembrane domain At some point the ER will receive a signal and the portion of the membrane holding the complex will bud off and be transported to the golgi bodies for further processing From the golgi bodies the complex is transported again via vesicle transport to the cell membrane This is the point at which the orientation mentioned previously becomes important The portion of the HLAA complex holding the peptide must be on the exterior surface of the cell membrane This is accomplished by vesicle fusion with the cell membrane

MHC Class I molecules present small peptides typically 710 amino acids in length to the immune system A glycoprotein called CD8 binds to residues 223229 in the 3 domain of HLAA and this glycoprotein stabilizes interactions between the tcell receptor on cytotoxic CD8 Tlymphocytes and the Class I MHC The Tcell receptor also has the potential to bind to the peptide being presented by the MHC In a properly functioning immune system only tcells that do not bind self peptides are allowed out of the thymus thus if a Tcell binds to the peptide it must be a foreign or abnormal peptide The tcell then initiates apoptosis or programmed cell death This process can happen as quickly as 5 minutes after initial foreign antigen presentation although typically it takes several hours for death to become apparent This process is the basis of acquired immunity and serves as the primary defense against viruses and other intracellular pathogens

By the 1960s it became evident that factors on donated organs and tissues often resulted in destruction of the donated tissue by the hosts immune system MHCs were originally discovered as a result of this observation see history of HLAs for more details There are two types of peptide presenting complexes Class I and Class II MHCs Each of these has multiple HLA genes of which HLAA is but one There are three major HLAs that should be matched between donors and recipients They are HLAA HLAB both Class I MHCs and HLADR a Class II MHC If the two tissues have the same genes coding for these three HLAs the likelihood and severity of rejection is minimized

HLAs serve as the sole link between the immune system and what happens inside cells Thus any alteration on the part of the HLA be it decreased binding to a certain peptide or increased binding to a certain peptide is expressed as respectively increased susceptibility to disease or decreased susceptibility to disease In other words certain HLAs may be incapable of binding any of the short peptides produced by proteolysis of pathogenic proteins If this is the case there is no way for the immune system to tell that a cell is infected Thus the infection can proliferate largely unchecked It works the other way too Some HLAs bind pathogenic peptide fragments with very high affinity This in essence supercharges their immune system in regards to that particular pathogen allowing them to manage an infection that might otherwise be devastating

One of the most researched examples of differential immune regulation of a pathogen is that of human immunodeficiency virus Because HIV is an RNA virus it mutates incredibly quickly This changes the peptides produced via proteolysis which changes the peptides able to be presented to the immune system by the infected cells MHCs Any virus with a mutation that creates a peptide with high affinity for a particular HLA is quickly killed by the immune system and thus does not survive and that high affinity peptide is no longer produced However it turns out that even HIV has some conserved regions in its genome and if a HLA is capable of binding to a peptide produced from a conserved region there is little the HIV can do to avoid immune detection and destruction This is the principle behind HLAmediated differential HIV loads

With over 2000 variations of the HLAA coded MHC it is difficult to determine the impact of all variants upon HIV loads However a select few have been implicated HLAA30 has been shown to decrease viral load to less than 10000 copiescubic millimeter considered quite low On the other hand HLAA02 has been implicated in high viral load greater than 100000 copiescubic millimeter when associated with HLAB45 Additionally the haplotypes HLAA23C07 and HLAA02C16 typically expressed increased viral loads within the sample population of Zambians One of the most effective HIVinhibiting haplotypes was HLAA30C03 while one of the least effective was HLAA23B14 In summation HLAA23 was highly correlated with increased HIV load among the sample population although it is important to note that across samples of differing ethnicity this correlation decreases significantly

Although classification of the effect of individual HLA genes and alleles on the presence of HIV is difficult there are still some strong conclusions that can be made Individuals who are homozygous in one or more Class I HLA genes typically progress to AIDS much more rapidly than heterozygotes In some homozygous individuals the rate of progression is double that of heterozygotes This differential progression is correlated fairly tightly with the degree of heterozygosity In summation certain HLAA alleles are associated with differing viral loads in HIV infected patients however due to the diversity amongst those alleles it is difficult to classify each and every alleles impact upon immune regulation of HIV Nevertheless it is possible to correlate heterozygosity in HLAA alleles to decreased rate of progression to AIDS

Not only do certain HLA alleles prescribe increased or decreased resistance to HIV but HIV is able to alter HLA expression and does so selectively leading to reduced elimination by natural killer cells NK cells Research has shown that HIV downregulates Class I MHC expression in infected cells However doing so indiscriminately opens up the opportunity for attack by NK cells because NK cells respond to downregulation of HLAC and HLAE Obviously this mechanism has put selective pressure on the HIV virus Thus HIV has evolved the capability to downregulate HLAA and HLAB without significantly disturbing the expression of HLAC and HLAE A protein coded for by the HIV genome negative regulatory factor Nef induces this change by binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the Class I MHC while it is still in the endoplasmic reticulum or occasionally while it is in the early stages of trafficking through the golgi bodies This complex of MHC and Nef then causes adaptor protein 1 AP1 to direct the MHC to the lysosomes for degradation instead of to the cell membrane where it normally functions In addition to selective HLA downregulation negative regulatory factor Nef enables HIV to downregulate CD4 and CD8 These glycoproteins are essential for respectively helper tcell and cytotoxic tcell binding to MHCs Without these cofactors both types of tcells are less likely to bind to HLAs and initiate apoptosis even if the HLA is expressing an HIV derived nonself peptide Both of these proteins are also targeted at their cytoplasmic tail domain The combination of these abilities greatly enhances HIVs ability to avoid detection by the immune system

HLAA is one particular group of the human Class I MHCs It consists of several hundred different genes and several thousand variant alleles HLAA is critical to the cytotoxic tcell controlled immune response to viruses and other intracellular pathogens Because each HLAA gene has a high affinity for slightly different peptides certain HLAAs are associated with increased risk more rapid progression andor increased severity of many diseases For similar reasons HLAA matching is essential to successful tissue transplants

Kane video game
Kane is a multisection action game published by Mastertronic for the Commodore 64 in 1986 It was ported to the Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC BBC Micro ZX Spectrum and the Commodore 16 and Plus4 The game is set in the Wild West and its name is a reference to the main character of the film High Noon It consists of four distinct scenes although some versions only contain two A sequel was released in 1988

The player takes the role of sheriff of the town of Kane The game is split into four levels two of which are shooting games using an onscreen target and two of which are sidescrolling action sequences on horseback Only the shooting levels are present in all versions of the game These may be played separately in the practice mode with only one try given but in order to complete and win the game they must be played successively The progress in the first scene defines the tries given in the next scenes

Scene 1 The player controls a target and must shoot birds with a bow and arrow in order to trade with the Indians The birds appear at varying altitude from the left and fly horizontally to the right At higher difficulty levels the speed also varies The player starts with ten arrows As the arrows take time to reach the target and the birds are moving the player must anticipate the position the birds will be when the arrow reaches them If the shot is successful the arrow returns to the quiver but arrows that miss are lost It is possible to take down more than one bird with a single shot if the falling bird hits another as it plummets The player can kill no more than forty birds or no more than forty birds can be let away a tally of each is kept on screen After the limit is reached or the quiver is empty the player proceeds to the next scene provided he has killed enough birds to trade for at least one peace token The number of birds required for a token depends on the difficulty level beginning with three The tokens earned in this scene act as the lives for the following scenes

Scene 2 The player is on horseback and must ride to the town of Kane in a set time limit The player must canter left to right or gallop to overcome wide obstacles There are a number of obstacles bushes rocks etc that the player must avoid by jumping over The peace tokens are spent if the horse collides with an obstacle and if the last medal spent the rider gives up and it is game over

Scene 3 When the player reaches the town he is ambushed by outlaws The player controls the aim of a revolver but unlike the first scene the character on screen also moves left and right with the aim movement The outlaws appear from cover at varying positions in the town and shoot at the player The player must shoot ten outlaws avoiding being shot himself At higher difficulty levels the bandits are quicker and more accurate The players revolver has six bullets At any time the player can move to the rightmost position to reload the weapon but he is still vulnerable when reloading The peace tokens are spent if the player is shot

Scene 4 The player is on horseback again and must catch a moving train this time moving from right to left The train is travelling at the horses canter speed so the player must gallop faster than train to reach the steamengine and stop the train As in scene 2 the horse must jump obstacles These are more diverse and complicated and require a perfect knowledge of their order At higher levels the player starts further from the engine and has to gallop longer The peace tokens are spent if the horse collides with an obstacle

After successfully completing the scenes the game then repeats with greater difficulty

The game was first released on the Commodore 64 in early 1986 It was then ported to Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum featuring all four scenes and Acorn Electron BBC Micro and Commodore 16Plus4 with only the shooting scenes included scenes 1 and 3 in the original game Despite this the BBCElectron inlay gives instructions for all four scenes This was corrected on the C16Plus 4 inlay All releases were in Mastertronics 199 range

Reviews for the game were mixed possibly reflecting the relative quality of the different versions of the game The original version on the C64 was given a generally positive review in Zzap64 with particular praise being given to the sampled sound effects and animation of the main sprites although they alleged that the main character is stolen from Impossible Mission The music comes in for criticism with the backgrounds and short nature of the game also being questioned but the game is recommended as worth every penny of the measly two quid asking price with an overall score of 63 In direct contrast their review of the C16 version in the ZzapC16 supplement the background graphics are praised but they claim the movement of the main sprite leaves a little to be desired giving an overall score of 48 The Amstrad version which is the most similar to the original was particularly well received scoring 70 in both Amstrad Action and Amtix

The Spectrum version gained less favourable reviews Your Sinclair was particularly critical giving a score of only 310 complaining of the luridly coloured background graphics and the dreadfully repetitive gameplay Graham Taylor of Sinclair User could find only the character animation worthy of praise saying the rest stinks giving a score of 25 Crash gave a slightly higher score of 54 but were still mostly dismissive and did not recommend the game claiming it was inferior to the original Mastertronic seem to have taken their time translating this to the Spectrum  and to be honest they shouldnt have bothered

Jon Revis of Electron User was also unimpressed with the Acorn version criticising the unresponsive controls and especially the fact that scenes 2 and 4 as described in the inlay are missing from the game Its a pity the programmer didnt read the inlay The game may only cost 199 but I cant help feeling Mastertronic will receive a few letters of complaint about this one The game was given a score of 410 for playability but an overall score of 610

Kane 2 was released in 1988 for the C64 but was not ported to any other machines It is very similar to the first game with almost identical graphics and gameplay Scene 1 is a riding and shooting level scene 2 is a shooting level like scene 3 in the first game scene 3 is a challenge to tame a bronco and scene 4 is a riding level The lack of improvement over two years after the original lead to negative reviews Zzap64 gave a score of 33 and said Its not abysmal its just that it doesnt really approach the standards required of a good budget program these days Kane was good for its time but in mid 1988 Kane II just doesnt appeal in the same way

Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 74
Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 74 74th Tactical Air Force Wing formerly known as Jagdgeschwader 74 JG 74 74th Fighter Wing is an aviation unit of the German Air Force based on Neuburg Air Base in Bavaria since 1961 On 1 October 2013 the unit was renamed in the course of adaptations to the new structure of the German Air Force

JG 74 provides air defence duties for southern Germany The wing operates two squadrons of Eurofighter Typhoons the Falken Falcons squadron and the Viva Zapata squadron

JG 74 was activated as the last West German fighter wing on 5 May 1961 It was equipped with the F86K Sabre interceptor and first based at Leipheim in 1960 as JG 75 It moved to Neuburg Air Base a short time later after this base had been opened and was renamed JG 74 In the period from 196466 JG 74 received the F104G Starfighter The Starfighter proved to be a troublesome aircraft for the Luftwaffe which lost 292 of 916 Starfighters 116 pilots died JG 74 also lost several of them until the wing converted to the F4F Phantom II in 1974

The F4F was a downgraded F4E which could not fire the medium range AIM7 Sparrow airtoair missile The use was forbidden until Germany became fully sovereign in 1990 Since then the F4Fs were upgraded to F4F ICE standard in the 1990s and were finally equipped to use the AIM120 AMRAAM missile Due to the smoke generated by the F4s General Electric J79 engines the German pilots dubbed the F4F the Air Defence Diesel The last of the F4Fs was retired on 12 June 2008

From 2006 to June 2008 JG 74 transitioned to the Eurofighter Typhoon

32 years after the crash and death of the German World War II fighter ace Werner Mlders JG 74 received the honorary name of JG 74 Mlders on 22 November 1973 However the German parliament decided in 1998 that it is not proper to name organizations after people who were active in the Legion Condor The German Military History Institute researched Mlders conduct and concluded that he concurred in his actions with the Nazi government and never opposed any actions taken by the Nazis Therefore the name Mlders was dropped by JG 74 on 11 June 2005

International Trade Union Confederation
The International Trade Union Confederation ITUC    is the worlds largest trade union federation It was formed on 1 November 2006 out of the merger of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ICFTU and the World Confederation of Labour WCL The Founding Congress of the ITUC was held in Vienna and was preceded by the dissolution congresses of both the ICFTU and the WCL The ITUC has three main regional organizations  the AsiaPacific Regional Organization the American Regional Organization and the African Regional Organization The Trade Union Development Cooperation Network TUDCN is an initiative of the ITUC whose main objective is to bring the trade union perspective into international development policy debates and improve the coordination and effectiveness of trade union development cooperation activities

The ITUC represents 207 million workers through its 331 affiliated organizations within 163 countries and territories Sharan Burrow is the current General Secretary

The ITUC traces its origins back to the First International also known as the International Workingmens Association and in 2014 commemorated the 150th anniversary of the founding of the International Working Mens Association at its own world congress held in Berlin Also in 2014 the ITUC debuted the Global Rights Index which ranks nations on 97 metrics pertaining to workers rights such as freedom from violent conditions and the right to strike and unionise

The founding congress of the ITUC was held from 1 to 3 November 2006 in Vienna Austria

The first day of the congress saw the formal creation of the ITUC followed by an address by Juan Somavia the DirectorGeneral of the International Labour Organization ILO

Day two included Pascal Lamy the DirectorGeneral of the World Trade Organization WTO responding to panel discussions on the impact of globalisation including the topics Cohesion and chaos  the global institutions and Global unions  global companies Technical difficulties limited Lamys satellite video link participation

Leadership and officers were elected on the final day of the congress Guy Ryder the former general secretary of the ICFTU was elected to the same position in the new organisation Sharan Burrow was elected president A Governing Council was established with 70 elected members and 8 additional seats reserved for youth and womens representatives

A Council of Global Unions was also formed on the final day of the congress It was established jointly with ten global union federations and the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD TUAC
The second congress of the ITUC was held from 21 to 25 June 2010 in Vancouver Canada

On 25 June 2010 at the conclusion of the congress Sharan Burrow then ITUC President was elected General Secretary succeeding Guy Ryder who had been elected as Deputy Director General of the International Labour Organization In anticipation of her election Burrow had resigned from her position as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions effective 1 July 2010

Speaking to the Congress after her election Burrow paid tribute to her predecessor and emphasised the continuing role of organised labour in the worlds emergence from the Global Financial Crisis She also made special mention of the significance of her election as the first female leader of the worlds largest trade union against a background of high workforce participation by women and a Congress 50 of whose delegates were women
I am a warrior for woman and we still have work to ensure the inclusion of women in the work place and in our unions The struggles for women are multiple  too often within their families for independence then in the workplace for rights and equal opportunity in their unions for access and representation and then as union leaders But the investment in and participation of women is not only a moral mandate it is an investment in democracy and a bulwark against fundamentalism and oppression Organising woman is and must continue to be a priority for the ITUC

The PanEuropean Regional Council PERC a European trade union organisation within the ITUC was formed 19 March 2007 It consists of 87 national trade union centres and a total membership of 87 million It works closely with the European Trade Union Confederation ETUC and Bernadette Sgol is currently the general secretary of both organisations The ITUC raises capital through charging dues to its member organisations

PCSXReloaded
PCSX is a free and opensource video game console emulator which allows software designed to be used with the Sony PlayStation to run on personal computers Over the years development changed hands several times with PCSXReloaded PCSXR now being the main version

PCSX has a high compatibility rate and is currently available for a number of different operating systems including Microsoft Windows OS X and Linux It is released under the GNU General Public License

The emulator was first released for the PC on August 31 2000 Official development ceased on September 17 2003 and development shifted to the new PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2

PCSXdf was created in 2006 and added new features a new GTKbased interface AMD64 support and corrected some bugs but was developed mainly with only Linux compatibility in mind Version 110 was released on March 29 2009

PCSXReloaded is a new project created in mid2009 which is based on the work of the PCSXdf branch completely independent and works on bug fixes while maintaining Windows and OS X compatibility alongside Linux PCSXdf and PCSXReloaded coexisted for a while with PCSXdf merging changes of PCSXReloaded back into df

PCSX supports network play and external plugins as used by ePSXe As with many modern emulators PCSXReloaded supports savestates and also has Save Rewind feature currently only OSX and Linux version Support for ECM files currently only OS X and Linux version Support for Libarchive currently only OSX and Linux version widescreen hack and makes use of plugins to emulate GPU SPU and CDROM drive functions a model first established in PSEmu Pro it uses Peops OpenGL plugin for graphics on default but can also use Petes OpenGL2 gpuBladeSoft PCSX2 graphics plugin GSDX AmiDog GPU plugin Asmodeans PSXFX shader pack input plugins such as Lilypad and Pokopom Pad Plugin It also has multitrack cue support and is the only PS1 emulator with compatibility with antijitter options in graphics plugins such as GTE accuracy in the default Peops OpenGL plugin or Improved coordinate accuracy in Edgblas gpuBladeSoft and it also supports PeteOpenGL2Tweak plugin Additionally PCSX seeks to simulate the functionality of the PlayStation BIOS and consequently does not require a BIOS file dump to operate making it easier to emulate legally however Bios emulation is still incomplete so its better to use dumped BIOS to avoid various bugs and reduced compatibility

Linux macOSOS X and Microsoft Windows on x86based computers are the main development focus of PCSXReloaded but various PCSX iterations have been ported to other platforms as well including Dreamcast GameCube PlayStation 3 Wii Xbox and various ARMbased platforms PCSXRearmed fork such as BlackBerry Playbook and Nintendo 3DS

Languages of Afghanistan
Afghanistan is a multilingual country in which two languages  Dari and Pashto  are both official and most widely spoken

Dari is the official name of the Persian language in Afghanistan It is often referred to as the Afghan Persian Although still widely known as Farsi Persian to its native speakers the name was officially changed to Dari in 1964

Both Persian and Pashto are IndoEuropean languages from the Iranian languages subfamily Other regional languages such as Uzbek Turkmen Balochi Pashayi and Nuristani are spoken by minority groups across the country

Minor languages include HindiUrdu Punjabi Ashkunu Kamkataviri Vasivari Tregami and Kalashaala Pamiri Shughni Munji Ishkashimi and Wakhi Brahui Arabic Qizilbash Aimaq and Pashai and Kyrgyz Linguist Harald Haarmann believes that Afghanistan is home to more than 40 minor languages with around 200 different dialects

The Dari language functions as the nations lingua franca and is the native tongue of various Afghan ethnic groups including the Tajiks Hazaras and Aimaks Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan Due to Afghanistans multiethnic character multilingualism is a common phenomenon
The exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnolinguistic groups are unavailable since no systematic census has been held in Afghanistan in decades The table below displays the major languages spoken in Afghanistan

A sizeable population in Afghanistan especially in Kabul can also speak and understand HindiUrdu due to the popularity and influence of Bollywood films and songs in the region

The official languages of the country are Dari and Pashto as established by the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan Dari is the most widely spoken language of Afghanistans official languages and acts as a lingua franca for the country In 1980 other regional languages were granted official status in the regions where they are the language of the majority This policy was codified in the 2004 Afghan Constitution which established Uzbek Turkmen Balochi Pashayi Nuristani and Pamiri as a third official language in areas where they are spoken by a majority of the population

<doc id="7719047" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7719047" title="Hollander beater">
Hollander beater
A Hollander beater is a machine developed by the Dutch in 1680 to produce paper pulp from cellulose containing plant fibers It replaced stamp mills for preparing pulp because the Hollander could produce in one day the same quantity of pulp it would take a stamp mill eight days to prepare

However the wooden paddles and beating process of a stamp mill produced longer more easily hydrated and more fibrillated cellulose fibers thus increasing the resulting papers strength The Hollander used metal blades and a chopping action to cut the raw material resulting in shorter cellulose fibers and weaker paper Further the metal blades of the Hollander often introduced metal contaminants into the paper as one metal blade struck another These contaminants often acted as catalysts for oxidation that have been implicated in browning of old paper called foxing
In turn the Hollander was partially replaced by the conical refiner or Jordan refiner named after its American inventor Joseph Jordan who patented the device in 1858

A Hollander beater design consists of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway The beater wheel is a centrifugal compressor or radial impeller cylinder parallel to a grooved plate similar to the construction of a water wheel or timing pulley Under power the blades rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry The beater wheel and plate do not touch as this would result in cutting The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers when passing through the beater

The objective of using a beater rather than another process like grinding as many woodpulp mills do is to create longer hydrated fibrillated fibers Fibrillated fibers are abraded to the extent that many partially brokenoff fibers extend from the main fiber increasing the fibers surface area and hence its potential for hydrogen bonding Grinding of fibers is not desirable Therefore the blades are not what might be thought of as sharpened and welldesigned beaters make it possible to minimize the shear action of the rotating blades against the bottom of the water raceway

Merry Mount opera
Merry Mount is an opera in three acts by American composer Howard Hanson its libretto by Richard Stokes is loosely based on Nathaniel Hawthornes short story The MayPole of Merry Mount taken from his Twice Told Tales Hansons only opera it was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City

The opera received its world premiere in concert at the fortieth annual May Festival of the University Musical Society in Ann Arbor Michigan at Hill Auditorium on May 20 1933 with the composer conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra The cast included Leonora Corona Rose Bampton Frederick Jagel Chase Baromeo John Charles Thomas and George Galvani

Its world stage premiere by the Metropolitan Opera was given on February 10 1934 As that performance took place at a Saturday matine it was broadcast nationally as part of the companys weekly radio series with Milton Cross serving as announcer The premiere featured Lawrence Tibbett in the central role of Wrestling Bradford the Puritan minister with Gladys Swarthout as his betrothed Plentiful Tewke Swedish soprano Gta Ljungberg and Canadian tenor Edward Johnson took the roles of the Cavalier lovers Lady Marigold Sandys and Sir Gower Lackland Tullio Serafin was on the podium At its premiere the opera received a total of fifty curtain calls still a house record The opera was performed eight more times during the season but never returned to the Mets repertory and subsequent performances have been scarce

Merry Mount is unusual in that its libretto was written without a composer in mind Stokes had conducted comprehensive research into Puritan fanaticism sexual obsession and demonology he found that it often reached pathological levels and usually ended in death as a form of punishment or redemption for its victims While he found his title in a story by Nathaniel Hawthorne Stokes crafted an original libretto which some compared to The Scarlet Letter Upon completion of the text Stokes went in search of a composer finally finding one in Howard Hanson Hanson for his part was new to the composition of opera although he had already written a fair amount of choral music Still he was already respected as an elder statesman of American classical music and such was his reputation that the Metropolitan was convinced to commission the work Merry Mount would be the fifteenth American opera and the last but one presented at the Met during the tenure of Giulio GattiCasazza as company director

The bluntness of the language used in the libretto surprised many and was remarked upon even during rehearsals the New York Times wrote on February 11 1934 The call for the first fulldress rehearsal of Mr Hansons first act to be held today found several of the singing actors wondering whether modern censorship would approve the candor of some of the plain English sung or spoken by the Pilgrim Fathers to their disturbing neighbors the Cavaliers of Quincy Mass

Vigorous in denunciation the more clerical characters do not mince their words One of them uses a series of unmistakable AngloSaxon epithets in accosting a woman described as Desire Annable a sinner

To the angry persons entirely specific charges the woman not only confesses but accepts meekly a rejoinder in terms rarely used in a theatre today

The end of their interview is the traditional Go and sin no more

Despite the fiscal frugality imposed on the company by the Great Depression a lavish production was designed for the opera and it was lushly cast Lawrence Tibbett was already wellknown to New York audiences for his work in American opera but the others were more familiar from other fields Gta Ljungberg was known primarily as a Wagnerian singer while Edward Johnson had been the companys principal tenor since 1922 and Gladys Swarthout had won fame as a singer of the French repertory

The action takes place in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 17th century

The main street of a Puritan settlement with meeting house stocks and pillory the meeting house doubles as a fortress complete with cannon embrasures and a parapet The opera begins at noon on a Sabbath Day sometime in May during the prelude the voices of the are heard calling for Gods retribution on unbelievers They are being urged on by their minister Wrestling Bradford The service ends and the congregation leaves the meeting house the men armed are led by Myles Brodrib and exit to the left while the women turn to the right All wait for Bradford to reappear especially Plentiful Tewke who has dared to accent her plain grey gown with a bow of flamecolored ribbon The minister emerges and continues his tirade against unbelievers inveighing against Satan and his attempts to demolish the new English Israel while the people listen in admiration Indians and their sorcery are responsible for the loss of the Puritans crops and provisions continues Bradford pointing as he does so to Samoset who reacts indignantly and stalks out

His sermon ended Bradford next turns his attention to Desire Annable who is held in the stocks by her wrists and ankles mother of an illegitimate child she has been serving her sentence after being found guilty of whoring Recalling Christs words to the woman caught in adultery Bradford tells her to go and sin no more and releases her She staggers up Love Brewster tries to help her but is angrily pushed away by her grandmother They exit shunned by the other women

In the pillory stands Jonathan Banks a Shaker and it is to him that Bradford now turns his attention Banks denies the ministers religion bringing upon himself cries of blasphemy and death threats from the assembled townsfolk Nevertheless he is set free and leaves to the accompaniment of blows from the crowd The people now continue their singing praising God and cursing the Devil Bradford joins with them in a final Amen before they go out leaving the minister alone with Plentiful Tewke and her father PraiseGod The latter two whisper together for a moment before Plentiful pushes her father forward herself withdrawing into the meeting house to observe what will happen meanwhile on the roof of the building FaintNot Tinker who has been keeping watch falls asleep

Tewke begins praising Bradfords sermon leading the latter to resume his harangue against the evils of the world with which the older man concurs But Bradford is haunted by visions of the concubines of Hell telling how one of them  Astoreth Queen of the Moon  came to tempt him to carnal sin in a dream the previous night He then kneels and prays that the temptation be taken from him Tewke next suggests that the minister is more than ripe for marriage and suggests his daughter as a suitable candidate noting her foolish fancy for him Bradford had previously chosen to remain celibate but now sees that marriage might perhaps be the will of God Tewke calls Plentiful out she admits her love and he leaves the couple together Bradford urges marriage at once while Plentiful seeks the delay of a month or at least a week to the last he agrees At her bidding he follows custom by giving her half of a coin she kisses his hand inflaming his passion He kisses her brutally she recoils This causes him dismay as he sees no cure for himself in the marriage
Children enter led by Love Brewster who brings flowers for Plentiful and the serious young Peregrine Brodrib seeing the couple together they delightedly begin to sing Plentiful Tewke hath catched the preacher before Bradford rebukes them for profaning the Sabbath He reminds them of the bears that ate the children that mocked Elisha and urges them to study their religious books he then exits followed by Plentiful Peregrine begins taking the group through catechism but is interrupted by the entrance of the bearded hunchback Jack Prence dressed in motley Prence devises a game with three chalk circles one symbolizes Heaven one Paradise and one Hell Two children stand in each circle before beginning a game of tag soon Peregrine wants to join in and demands to replace Loves partner All save him are amused when he is knocked over and finds himself relegated to Hell he leaves angrily and threatens to tell his father what has transpired

Brodrib arrives with three Puritans carrying pikes interrupting the game They question Prence about his company of merry gentleman that has recently landed and that appears ready to celebrate with a maypole dance They are appalled at even the thought of such behavior and tie Prence to the whippingpost and begin to whip him Bradford in thoughtful mood enters and is met by Lady Marigold Sandys richly attired in riding habit velvet skirts and a hat of feathers and jewels He immediately becomes enraptured by her she for her part belabors him and sets Prence free Brodrib makes as if to threaten her but Bradford stops him Marigold calls on her friends the handsome and arrogant Sir Gower Lackland among them who enter with swords drawn just as FaintNot Tinker awakens and falls from the parapet Lackland is accompanied by Thomas Morton Lady Marigolds uncle and by the parson Jewel Scrooby Lackland and Brodrib fight while the others join in Bradford stands apart still transfixed by Marigold Tinker sounds the alarm on his drum calling other Puritans to rush in Cavaliers are ranged against them carrying the preparations for their maypole Tinker threatens to fire but Tewke appears and rebukes the fighters The parties make introductions Scrooby with his evident interest in worldly things causes particular offense with his appearance The Cavaliers present a royal warrant from Charles I which Tewke rejects furiously

The groups express their contrasting views of each other the Puritans view the Cavaliers as idle fools while the Cavaliers see the Puritans as rebels Bradford interrupts and rebukes his townsmen welcoming the newcomers and even promising Pence shelter in his own house His manner is wild alarming his friends But he urges the Cavaliers to repentance only to be mocked first by Prence and then by Scrooby before the others join in Tewke thunders at them to return to England at last a truce is called Marigold and Lackland are left gazing at each other lovingly to the consternation of Bradford Observed by Plentiful Tewke he falls to his knees and begs Marigold to allow him to free her from Satan She gives him hope by telling him to come to her at sundown but then dashes it by saying that she wishes him to marry her to Lackland They leave and the minister in anguish orders his followers to break the truce and attack the Cavaliers The Puritans resolve to do so Plentiful approaches Bradford and touches his arm he appears not to recognize her and throws down his half of the betrothal coin grinding it underfoot to her tearful dismay The act ends with both parties expressing resolve to do as they please the Cavaliers wish to dance and sing while the Puritans wish to destroy their enemies

A hilltop with a maypole made from a pine tree at the center a throne sits before it and to its left are tables for a banquet The curtain rises after a short prelude Women are seen preparing the maypole Trumpets cannon fire and the bell of a distant ship signal the beginning of May Day festivities and the procession led by Morton and Scrooby enters Morton is bedecked as Master of Merry Disports while Scrooby vested as English priest wears a chaplet of vine leaves on his head and a garland over one shoulder he is Abbot of Misrule Lackland enters behind them he is May Lord he wears white with a rainbow scarf across his breast and a small dress sword at his side Prence is his comic trainbearer and he is attended by the Nine Worthies Every form of traditional English reveller is present including nymphs satyrs dwarfs fauns mummers shepherds and shepherdesses Morris dancers sword dancers green men wild men jugglers tumblers minstrels archers and mountebanks there are even an ape a hobby horse and a dancing bear An effigy of Flora stands to one side Lackland proclaims a Commonweal of Joy and renames the hill Merry Mount before taking his seat with the Worthies Morton and Scrooby marshal the revellers who dance around the pole Samoset enters with members of his tribe during the dance and offers Lackland gifts the Indians are made welcome and offered wine and food As the dancing becomes wilder they leave in search of the wine

Horns sound and the revellers stop dancing to make way for thirtysix girls they form a coach for Lady Marigold dressed as Flora twirling parasols to represent the wheels Two children serve as the horses for the coach a third plays coachman while a fourth as postillion sits at the rear The revellers greet the Lady of May on her weddingday Lackland too greets her praising her beauty she responds in kind The two advance to the maypole where Scrooby stands prayer book in hand ready to perform the marriage service As he is about to pronounce them man and wife Bradford enters and bids him stop the minister rails against the pagan revelry and the maypole Armed Puritans enter the Cavaliers unarmed cannot defend themselves Morton accuses Tewke of breaking the truce undaunted the Puritans drive the Cavaliers away and set about taking down the maypole and removing all signs of revelry Samoset and his followers appear the chief claps Brodrib on the shoulder only to have the wine cup struck from his hand He is then slashed with a gauntlet and leaves in anger to be followed a moment later by Bradford Tewke satisfied watches as the Puritans complete their task to the sounds of wind and thunder somewhere distant

In the forest This follows the first scene at once Bradford enters followed by two Puritans who drag Marigold between them One carries a dark lantern the minister bids him open it and leave the couple together He wishes he says to wrestle with her soul The two men leave and Bradford declares his love to Marigold who responds with dismay and loathing He threatens to kill her rather than see her with Lackland he seizes her and she strikes him Lackland staggers in during their struggle His costume is dishevelled and torn He fights the minister but breaks off when Tewke enters with other Puritans who are armed and carry axes and lanterns Lackland seizes an axe but is immediately run through to Tewkes dismay by a pike carried by one of the Puritans He dies in Marigolds arms she kisses his brow then stands and calls for vengeance and for her own death Tewke orders her taken to the village as a prisoner and his men exit dragging her away and removing Lacklands body Left alone with him Tewke rebukes the minister and urges his repentance He leaves and Bradford prays for divine aid Exhausted by his anguish and his fight he falls asleep to the sound of mystic voices echoing his Amen

Hell While he sleeps Bradford dreams of the Valley of Tophet the maypole has become a giant toadstool and the pagan characters of the revels have become intermingled with figures from Christian demonology The Cavaliers have become Princes Warriors and Courtesans of Hell Lackland is Lucifer while the Worthies have morphed into Dagon Moloch and GogMagog Morton is Beelzebub Scrooby the Antichrist Mahomet and Anubis are present as is Samoset in the form of a medicine man The beast of the Apocalypse composed of the dancing bear and an eagle and lion is also in attendance Marigold is Astoreth Prence carries Lucifers train Witches and a minotaur his body painted like an Indians are in attendance More monsters appear including a large toad with a jewel in its forehead Bradford remains invisible and inaudible to them all Lucifer enters the plain to the accompaniment of ancient instruments and heralds Warriors with sinister banners and bizarre weapons arrive accompanying nine princes and their acolytes who swing censers filled with brimstone Lucifer pale and with a bloody bandage across his chest stands on the ridge his attendants help him down the rocks Thrones appear from the ground one each for him and for Astoreth and for the nine princes The monsters kneel as Lucifer passes among them Bradford tries to stand but cannot As Lucifer stands before his throne the assembled company bow down thunder and lightning accompany them as they greet their master At a signal from him they stand and begin to dance stopping when he signals again Bradford is seized brought forward and ordered to reject his God Courtesans dance to tempt him but it is Marigold in Babylonian costume with a crescent of jewels on her head that persuades him to fall He curses Puritan New England and signs the Devils book taking the Devils mark on his brow Lucifer leaves laughing contemptuously but Astoreth stays with Bradford who remembering the Song of Solomon bids her rise up and come away He leads her to the door of a tent they embrace and then enter as the act ends

The forest Bradford lies asleep Plentiful has covered him with her cloak and crouches in terror at his side A lantern lies on the ground the scene is lit by moonlight Bradford calls out in his sleep to Astoreth and tries to embrace Plentiful who shrinks from him in horror He awakens and tells her that in his dream he was crowned Emperor of Hell In fear they hurry away together

The main street of the village Indian war drums may be heard and as the curtain rises Samoset and his braves are seen finishing a war dance The church is completely gone other structures are burning An Indian drags in Love Brewster she tries to scream but is scalped A shot is heard and Samoset falls dead The Indians flee as the Puritans some wounded return Loves grandmother is distraught to see her granddaughters body while Tewke and others cry out in biblical lament over the destruction that they see
Bradford appears and the townsfolk turn to him for prayer and aid But he is horrified at the realization of his curse and tells them of his dream and of his apostasy he will never again pray The Puritans lament the loss of their leader Marigold distraught and fatigued appears her festal dress torn She recoils from the minister in horror The Puritans heap abuses on her calling her a witch and demanding her death She tells them that she is no witch happy once her husband is dead and she will be happy no more but must soon join him The people prepare to stone her but stop when Bradford tears off his clerical bands and skullcap revealing the mark of the Devil on his brow He calls on his new master flames engulf the village Marigold swoons in fear and Bradford seizes her carrying her in his arms into the fire In horror the Puritans kneel in prayer and the opera closes as they intone the Lords Prayer

Merry Mount was successful at its appearance  A Stirring Ovation  Reception of HansonStokes Opera most Enthusiastic of 10 Years at Metropolitan read the headline on page 1 of the second section of the Times  but audiences seemed more pleased with the piece than did the critics Typical of the latters attitude was Pitts Sanborns review for the New York WorldTelegram Dr Hansons music is most effective in the choral passages which are plentiful Take the chant of the men within the church after the impressive choral prelude True there is oftener the suggestion of Moussorgsky than of Massachusetts but who would be so ungracious as to object to that Nor has Dr Hanson failed to assemble lively measures for the Maypole dance or to strike the witching note called for by the wild doings at the Hellish Rendezous Unfortunately his writing for the solo voices is not free from awkwardness and at times the weight and density of the orchestral fabric constitutes a barrier between the word that is sung and the ears of the audience
Less enthusiastic was Olin Downes writing for the February 11 edition of the TimesThe story is too cluttered up with incidental diversions  The principal defect of this book lies  in the inhumanity of Bradford He is nothing but a maddened and perverted sadist Our Puritan forefathers despite all the presentday condemnation of suppressions and the like were much more than that They had very noble sides they had superb heroism There should be more conflicting impulse and action and relieving traits in this character for us to believe in him

 The music is at times conventionally and noisily effective Otherwise it displays neither originality nor any special aptitude for the theatre Its strongest point is the choral writing That is somewhat inappropriate in the sense of dramatic verity because we know that no Puritans sang these elaborate choruses or anything much like them
Critics were however nearly universal in their applause for the cast especially for Tibbett Sanborn in his review saidMerry Mount is almost a onepart opera and that part is Wrestling Bradford In it Mr Tibbett exhibits once more his intelligence and skill as a singing actor as well as splendid courage and endurance The wooden angularity of his movements and gestures however was a mistaken exaggeration That the terrific tessitura of his part interferes with his vocal security and freedom was of course not his fault
Downes for his part wrote that  The cast and orchestra were admirable Mr Tibbett had to shout his way against prevailingly heavy orchestration all through the opera so that it was no wonder his tone showed sign of strain He was nevertheless as effective as he possibly could be in an ineffective part Mme Ljungberg also shouted but with evident care for the purpose and respect for the composers intention and melodic line  
Mr Johnson sang excellently with a fine quality  The chorus was superb and Mr Serafin very plainly had prepared the opera with the greatest care Times February 11 1934
Downes also found occasion to comment upon the makeup of the audience
Another feature of the occasion was the uncommon character of the audience On the social and musical side it was exceptionally representative but it had also an element not often present in such force in this lyric theatre For this was an audience more thoughtful and conservative than is customary in many places of public amusement

Those who do not always patronize opera as an amusement were there They listened and they looked with a special seriousness and interest It is reasonable to believe that this substantial gathering in a theatre crowded to capacity was attracted by the nature of Mr Stokes subject 

To other facts of the occasion should be added these That the performance was repeatedly punctuated by applause that after the first curtain there was a particular burst of approval for Lawrence Tibbett that after the second curtain there were recalls after recalls for Dr Hanson and for Mr Stokes who came back and forth with complete clat and showed clearly their approval of the audience Enthusiasm grew There was more applause after the second actthe Maypole scenethan after the first and more after the third than after the second

Later critics have not been kinder to Merry Mount Paul Jackson in his book Saturday Afternoons at the Old Met writes thatHansons incessant drumbeat ostinati and repetitive fanfares ultimately relegate a large portion of the score to the realm of background music Hanson establishes no distinctive sound signature either in the predictably Polovetzian choral and ballet sections or in his monochromatic vocal writing for the principals  Hanson is overfond of length choral vocalizations on Ah too often the music calls to mind the trappings of a Hollywood soundtrack After Bradfords penitential immolation a final choral apotheosis accompanied by the inevitable drums brings the opera to a close One must echo Johnsons lament that all their labors and money had gone for nothing

Even some members of the cast were disappointed in Merry Mount Johnson after two weeks rehearsal confessed that he was pretty well fed up with it  Merry Mount is a very pretentious ineffective work later calling his role simply lousy

The opera was given a further eight times during the season including three tour performances the last of these took place in Rochester New York where Hanson was director of the Eastman School of Music

Despite its initial appearance of success Merry Mount was dropped from the repertory after the 193334 season and has not enjoyed many revivals since Hanson compiled a suite for orchestra from excerpts of the piece which consists of the prelude the childrens dance from Act I the love duet from Act II and the prelude and ballet from Act II This has enjoyed more popularity than the opera and has received multiple recordings

In April 2014 Merry Mount was revived in two performances at the Eastman Theater in Rochester by the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra On May 7 2014 the same orchestra played Merry Mount at Carnegie Hall in New York its first New York performance in 80 years

A recording of the 1934 world premiere broadcast of Merry Mount by the Metropolitan Opera was issued on CD by Naxos Records in 1998 Small snippets of music missing from the original master discs are missing from the recording the release does however feature commentary by the announcer Milton Cross as originally heard onair

Not long after the operas premiere the composer led a group of student performers in a recording now long out of print of excerpts from the piece Numerous recordings of the orchestral suite exist

Tibbett recorded Bradfords firstact aria Oh tis an earth defiled on 19 January 1934 shortly before his performance of the role at the stage premiere This was for many years the only excerpt of the opera that was commercially available

In May 2007 Naxos Records released a complete CD recording of Merry Mount performed by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Gerard Schwarz This recording was made at the time of an October 1996 concert production of the opera in Seattle celebrating the 100th anniversary of Hansons birth

George Hamilton footballer
George Hamilton 7 December 1917  May 2001 was a Scottish international footballer who spent most of his 21year career with Aberdeen He also played for Queen of the South Heart of Midlothian and Hamilton Academical

Born in Irvine Hamilton started out with local junior side Irvine Meadow before moving to Dumfries to join Queen of the South Hamilton was comfortable with the ball on either foot and had an obvious love of playing the game After a single season with Queens scoring nine goals in 31 league games Aberdeen managed by Dave Halliday another exQueen of the South player purchased him for 3000 in April 1938

Hamilton would prove as shrewd a signing as Halliday would ever make as he would emerge as an inspirational player of real quality

Like many of his contemporaries Hamiltons career was significantly disrupted by the Second World War and when League football in Scotland went into abeyance in 1939 he returned to his native Ayrshire Eventually temporary Regional Leagues were established and due to wartime travel restrictions players would guest for local sides This resulted in Hamilton turning out for first Ayr United then Rangers between 1940 and 1945

Hamilton returned to Aberdeen at the end of global hostilities and enjoyed his most successful period lifting the transitional 194546 League Cup then scoring the winner in the 1947 Scottish Cup Final against Hibernian Despite this when Heart of Midlothian offered 8000 plus the younger Archie Kelly for his services in December 1947 the Reds considered it good value for a 30yearold and accepted

After only 17 appearances scoring six goals in thirteen league games for Hearts an unsettled Hamilton returned to Aberdeen

In March 1950 Hamilton played in a titanic Scottish Cup quarter final tussle against former club Queen of the South now also a top division side Playing at Palmerston Park and with Hamilton pulling the strings the Dons were three goals up after 15 minutes playing some fine football A Doug McAvoy goal reduced the deficit to two goals at half time Queens unleashed a second half onslaught Amid some frantic play Queens pulled a goal back with nine minutes remaining from Doug McBain Billy Houliston playing out of position on the right wing then crossed for McAvoys second goal to level the scores at 33 Frank Watson in the Aberdeen goal pulled off an outstanding last minute save to force a replay back in Aberdeen In the 28th minute Aberdeen again went a goal up before Houliston playing at his preferred centre forward after a tactical reshuffle during the game lashed home the equaliser from a McAvoy pass A minute later Queens were ahead for the first time in the tie  McAvoy again the provider for Charlie Johnston this time to trouble the score keeper With no more goals Queens went through to the semi final for the first time in their history

Despite Aberdeens erratic league results Hamilton helped the side to two further losing Scottish Cup Final appearances in 1953 and 1954

Age eventually caught up with Hamilton and he was transferred to Hamilton Academical in 1955 having largely watched from the sidelines as a young Dons side won the 195455 League title with the long serving Halliday still at the helm

Hamilton retired a matter of months after joining Academicals not long after his 38th birthday In his eleven league appearances for the club he scored two goals

Hamiltons consistent good form in 194546 earned him a Scotland national team debut against Northern Ireland

Hamilton twice earned an international recall initially in 1951 when he scored a hattrick against Belgium then remarkably in 1954 when aged 36 He played 2 games against Norway scoring the only goal of the game played in Scotland

This latter return coincided with the 1954 FIFA World Cup and Hamilton was selected in the 22man squad for Switzerland Scotland decided to take only 13 players to the finals with Hamilton one of the players to stay at home on reserve with the likes of Bobby Combe and Jimmy Binning However Hibs Bobby Johnstone withdrew through injury with Hamilton called in to replace him in the 13 to travel However Hamilton did not play in either of Scotlands two games

Hamilton was the first former Queen of the South player to travel to the World Cup Finals Sam Malcolmson to Spain in 1982 and Bernie Slaven at Italia 90 are the others to have done so

After hanging up his boots Hamilton joined the Aberdeen coaching team

Stefano Colantuono
Stefano Colantuono born 23 October 1962 in Rome is an Italian football professional football manager and former player who played as a defender He most recently served as the head coach of Serie B club Salernitana

Colantuono a centre back started his playing career for Serie D side Velletri in 1981 In 1983 he moved to Ternana of Serie C1 then Arezzo of Serie B and finally made his Serie A debut for Pisa He played Serie A until 1990 for several teams In 1991 he accepted to play in the national futsal league for BNL Roma winning a scudetto Following this experience Colantuono played mostly at lower levels especially Serie C2 and Serie D and even Eccellenza for Sambenedettese in 199495 After a long list of experiences in different Italian regions Colantuono returned to play for Sambenedettese in November 2000 leading his team to an immediate promotion to Serie C2

The 200102 Serie C2 season for Sambenedettese was going to be very hard with two coaches fired throughout the season After the sack of third coach Enrico Nicolini Colantuono a player for the team was appointed to manage Sambenedettese together with Gabriele Matricciani for the last nine matches Surprisingly Colantuono managed to win all these nine matches leading his team to a fifth place qualifying and successively even winning the promotion playoffs

Colantuonos Serie C1 coaching debut in 200203 ended in another fifth place securing a place in the promotion playoff then lost to Pescara In the meanwhile Luciano Gaucci owner of Sambenedettese Serie B team Catania and Serie A team Perugia at the time appointed Colantuono at the helm of the Sicilian side Colantuono again supported by Matricciani because of his lack of a regular coaching license led Catania to a fairly good season in ninth place In 200405 after Catania was sold by the Gaucci family Colantuono finally authorized to act as first team coach signed for Perugia just relegated to Serie B He led the team to a spot in the promotion playoff then lost to Torino After the cancellation of Perugia in 200506 Colantuono accepted the offer of Atalanta leading the nerazzurri to a clear Serie B win In the season 200607 he led Atalanta to an impressive seventh place in the Serie A table

On 31 May 2007 he was announced as new Palermo head coach to replace Francesco Guidolin However after a number of unimpressive performances ended by a crushing 50 loss to Juventus persuaded club chairman Maurizio Zamparini to sack him on 26 November 2007 He was once again recalled on 24 March 2008 to replace Guidolin as head coach of Palermo However Colantuono was sacked again after just one game of the 200809 season and was replaced by Davide Ballardini on 4 September

On 15 June 2009 he was appointed as new head coach of Torino replacing Giancarlo Camolese He guided the granata through their 200910 Serie B campaign with the aim to promptly lead the historical Turin club back into the top flight He was however fired on 29 November due to poor results and replaced by Mario Beretta On 10 January 2010 he was then reappointed as head coach to replace Beretta himself He announced his resignation after losing the promotion playoff finals to Brescia contemporaneously confirming he was in talks for the vacant coaching post at his previous club Atalanta Colantuonos comeback at Atalanta was officially announced the next day Under his tenure Atalanta promptly won the Cadetti and promotion back to Serie A in his first season in charge during the 201011 Serie B season

Colantuono led Atalantas successful return to the top flight during the 201112 Serie A season resulting in a comfortable 12thplace finish An impressive outcome considering the club began the season with a sixpoint deduction for its involvement in the 201112 Italian football scandal An additional deduction of 2 points followed before the 201213 Serie A season however Colantuono still managed to guide Atalanta to safety with a 15thplace finish Keeping with their manager for the 201314 Serie A campaign Coulantuono secured 11th place and some impressive performance including victories of local rivals Internazionale and AC Milan Before the start of the 201415 Serie A season Coulantuono committed his future to Atalanta however the season did not go well and after a poor run of form he was dismissed on 4 June 2015 and replaced by Edy Reja leaving Atalanta only 3 points above the relegation zone He took up the head coach position soon after at Udinese

He then guided Bari from November 2016 till June 2017 only managing a twelfth place by the end of the season with one of the clubs that was more widely expected to fight for a promotion spot He was subsequently appointed head coach of Salernitana on December 2017 taking over from Alberto Bollini guiding the club to a midtable finish

After being confirmed in charge of Salernitana for the 201819 season Colantuono resigned on 18 December 2018 after three consecutive defeats which left the promotion hopefuls in a midtable position in the league table

Nevile Henderson
Sir Nevile Meyrick Henderson 10 June 1882  30 December 1942 was a British diplomat and Ambassador of the United Kingdom to Nazi Germany from 1937 to 1939

He was born at Sedgwick Park near Horsham Sussex the third child of Robert and Emma Henderson His uncle was Reginald Hargreaves who married Alice Liddell the original of Alice in Wonderland Henderson was very attached to the countryside of Sussex especially his hometown of Sedgwick writing in 1940 Each time that I returned to England the white cliffs of Dover meant Sedgwick for me and when my mother died in 1931 and my home was sold by my elder brothers wife something went out of my life which nothing can replace Henderson was extremely close to his mother Emma a strongwilled woman who had successfully managed the estate at Sedgwick after her husbands death in 1895 and who developed the gardens of Sedgwick so well that they were photographed by the Country Life magazine in 1901 Henderson called his mother the presiding genius of Sedgwick who was a wonderful and masterful woman if ever there was one 

He was educated at Eton and joined the Diplomatic Service in 1905 Henderson saw himself as a member of the Establishment and had the typical views of an upperclass Victorian Englishman convinced of the superiority of all things British and seeing the British Empire as the greatest force for the good Henderson had a great love of sports guns and hunting and those who knew him noted he was always most happy when he was out on the hunt Henderson was also known for his love of clothing always wearing the most expensive Savile Row suits and a red carnation being considered to be one of the most best dressed men in the Foreign Office Hendersons obsession with his wardrobe social etiquette and hunting was part of a carefully cultivated image that he sought for himself as a polished English gentleman Henderson never married but his biographer Peter Neville wrote women played an important role in his life Hendersons lifelong bachelorhood did not cause questions about his sexuality with Baron Ernst von Weizscker the State Secretary of the Auswrtiges Amt writing in his diary that Henderson was a ladiess man 

In the early 1920s Henderson was stationed at the embassy in Turkey where he played a major role in the often difficult relations between Britain and the new Turkish republic Henderson had wanted a posting in France rather than Turkey and constantly complained to his superiors about being sent to the latter place It during his time in Turkey when Henderson played a major role in the negotiations about the Mosul dispute as Turkish president Mustafa Kemal had laid claim to the Mosul region of Iraq Henderson was prepared to yield about Turkish demands for Constantinople arguing that after the Chanak crisis of 1922 when it was dramatically revealed that public opinion in both Britain and the Dominions were unwilling go to war over the issue that Britain had a very weak hand but was more forceful in upholding the British claim to the Mosul region 

He served as an envoy to France in 192829 and as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between 1929 and 1935 where he was in close confidence with King Alexander and Prince Paul Henderson had been lobbying for a major post in the embassy in Paris and did not want to the minister in Belgrade notably continuing to pay the rent for his apartment in Paris for some time after moving to Belgrade as he was had expecting to move back to Paris soon The British legation in Belgrade was considered to be unglamorous post in contrast to the grand embassies in Paris Berlin Rome Moscow Vienna Madrid and Washington During his time in Belgrade Henderson became a very close friend of King Alexander as Henderson had a strong tendency towards heroworship and in King Alexander he found a hero worthy of his admiration Hendersons dispatches from Belgrade took on a notably proYugoslav tone as for Henderson King Alexander was a hero who could do no wrong In January 1929 King Alexander who until then had been a constitutional monarch had staged a selfcoup abolishing democracy and making himself the dictator of Yugoslavia Hendersons friendship with King Alexander who shared his love of hunting and guns notably increased British influence in Yugoslavia which first brought him attention in the Foreign Office 

As during his time in Berlin Henderson took exception to any negative remark in the British press about Yugoslavia writing to the Foreign Office if anything could be done to silence criticism of Yugoslavia After attending King Alexanders funeral Henderson wrote I felt more emotion at King Alexanders funeral than I felt at any other except my mothers Henderson wrote to a friend in Britain in 1935 My sixth winter in the Belgrade trenches is the worse of all The zest has gone out of it with King Alexander gone It interested me enormously to play Stockmar to his Albert and that made all the difference In January 1935 the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office Sir Robert Van Vansittart sharply rebuked Henderson for a letter he had written to Prince Paul the Regent of Yugoslavia for the boy king Peter II in which Henderson strongly supported Yugoslavias complaints against Italy Vansittart complained particularly about Hendersons claim that the Italian government was supporting Croat and Macedonian separatist terrorists and that Italy had been involved in the assassination of King Alexander in Marseilles in October 1934 writing Are we convinced of this and do we wish Prince Paul to think that we are convinced of it

In 1935 he became Ambassador to Argentina before on 28 May 1937 the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden appointed him Ambassador in Berlin A subsequent Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote Eden wanted an ambassador in Berlin who could get along well with dictators and Vansittart gave him a list of three diplomats who had shown a strong partiality towards autocratic leaders namely Henderson Sir Percy Loraine and Sir Miles Lampson In his 1956 memoirs The Mist Procession Vansittart wrote about the appointment of Henderson Nevile Hendersonmade such a hit with the dictator King Alexander by his skill at shooting that he was ultimately picked for Berlin All know the consequences Hendersons promotion from being the ambassador in Buenos Aires to being the ambassador in Berlinregarded as one of the grand embassies in the Foreign Officewas a major boost to his ego Henderson wrote at the time that he believed he had been specially selected by Providence for the definite mission of I trusted helping to preserve the peace of the world As he crossed the Atlantic on a ship to take him back to Britain Henderson who was fluent in German read Mein Kampf in the original German version to acquaint himself with the thinking of Adolf Hitler Henderson wrote in his 1940 The Failure of a Mission that he was determined to see the good side of the Nazi regime as well as the bad and to explain as objectively as I could its aspirations and viewpoint to His Majestys Government 

Upon arriving in London Henderson met the Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain who was due to replace Stanley Baldwin as prime minister the next month for a briefing about the Berlin mission Some controversy has ensued over just what precisely Chamberlain told Henderson In his book Failure of a Mission Henderson wrote that Chamberlain outlined to me his views on the general policy towards Germany and I think I may honestly say to the last and bitter end I followed the general line which he set me all the easily and faithfully since it corresponded so closely with my own private conception of the service I could best render in Germany to my own country Henderson was to claim that Chamberlain had authorised him to commit calculated indiscretions in the pursuit of peace through the Germanborn American historian Abraham Ascher wrote no evidence has emerged to support this claim TPhilip ConwellEvans a proNazi British historian who taught German history at Knigsburg University was later to claim that Henderson had told him that Chamberlain had made him his personal envoy to Germany and he was to bypass Vansittart by taking orders directly from the Prime Ministers office Regardless of what Chamberlain said to Henderson in April 1937 Henderson always seemed to have regarded himself as directly answerable to 10 Downing Street and showed a marked tendency to ignore Vansittart 

A believer in appeasement policies Henderson thought Adolf Hitler could be controlled and pushed toward peace and cooperation with the Western powers Like almost all of the British elite in the interwar era Henderson believed that the Treaty of Versailles was far too harsh on Germany and if only the terms of Versailles were revised in Germanys favor then another world war could be prevented Neville wrote the charge that Henderson was proNazi is incorrect as Henderson was rather antiVersailles as he had been advocating revising the terms of the Treaty of Versailles in favor of Germany long before Hitler ever came to power By contrast Ascher credited Hendersons beliefs about avoiding war due to his desire to uphold white supremacy and to avoid another fratricidal war between white peoples at a time when Asian black and brown peoples were starting to demand equality citing Hendersons dispatch to Eden on 26 January 1938 that warned that another AngloGerman war would beabsolutely disastrousI cannot imagine and would be unwilling to survive the defeat of the British Empire At the same time I would view with dismay another defeat of Germany which would merely serve the purposes of inferior races 

Shortly after arriving in Berlin Henderson started to clash with Vansittart Vansittart complained that Henderson was exceeding his brief and becoming too close to the Nazi leaders especially Hermann Gring who became Hendersons best friend Henderson first met Gring on 24 May 1937 and admitted to having a real personal liking for him The same tendency towards heroworship that Henderson had displayed towards King Alexander when he was in Belgrade reasserted itself in Berlin towards Gring as Henderson had a fascination with militaristic authority figures Gring shared Hendersons love of hunting and guns and the two frequently went off together on hunting trips in the forests of Germany Eden sharply criticised Henderson for not challenging Grings statement that the German people should not look upon Britain as an enemy in their path and closer AngloGerman ties were needed as it implied that British foreign policy was antiGerman In one of his calculated indiscretions Henderson broke with the unwritten rule in the Foreign Office that ambassadors should never criticise their predecessors and told Gring that Sir Eric Phipps had been too insensitive towards German concerns 

In June 1937 the Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King visited Berlin to meet Hitler and during the same visit Mackenzie King told Henderson that Hitler had said they all liked him and felt he had a good understanding of German problems a remark that appealed much to Hendersons vanity Hitler called Henderson the man with the carnation a reference to the red carnation Henderson always wore and despised him finding Henderson to be too superior in his manners for his liking In contrast to his close friendship with Gring Hendersons relationship with the Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop was extremely antagonistic as Henderson detested Ribbentrop writing to King George IV that Ribbentrop was eaten up with conceit Henderson argued that the Nazi regime was divided into factions whom he called the moderates and the extremists Henderson regarded Gring as the leader of the moderates which also included the Wehrmacht officer corps the Reichsbank officials the professional diplomats of the Auswrtiges Amt and the officials of the Economics ministry while the extremists were Joachim von Ribbentrop Josef Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler Henderson argued that Britain should work to revise the international system established by the Treaty of Versailles in favor of Germanyarguing that this would strengthen the moderates in Germany and weaken the extremistsas the best way of preventing another world war Henderson regarded the aims of the moderates such as the return of the Free City of Danzig the Polish Corridor Upper Silesia and the lost colonies in Africa together with an Anschluss with Austria and having the Sudetenland join Germany were all reasonable and just 

When Henderson accepted Grings invitation to attend the 1937 Nazi Party Rally in Nuremberg without consulting the Foreign Office Vansittart was furious writing that it was extraordinary that Henderson should not only take an important decision like this off his own bat without giving us a chance at consultationbut also announce it to a foreign colleague as a decision Vansittart wrote to Henderson that he should not attend the Party Rally in Nuremberg saying you would be suspected of giving countenance or indeed eulogy as alleged by one Member of Parliament to the Nazi system and the Foreign Office would be accused of having fascist leanings Henderson wrote back that one has to be empirical to a certain degree and since Nazism could not be wished away what was the point of being discourteous to Hitler and unnecessarily irritating to him Much to Vansittarts annoyance Henderson attended the Nazi Party Rally in Nuremberg in September 1937 which was widely taken at the time as showing British approval of National Socialist ideology At the same time Henderson described the Strength Through Joy movement and the labour camps for young people as showing the beneficial aspects of Hitlers rule who ensured that the young Germans developed properly patriotic attitudes towards the Fatherland 

Henderson called the Party Rally of 1937 which took place between 1011 September a most impressive event attended by some 140 000 Germans who were full enthusiasm for the regime Henderson wrote that his hosts in Nuremberg went out of their way to be friendly towards him giving him a luxurious apartment to stay in and inviting him to sumptuous meals with the best German food and wine being served From Nuremberg Henderson reported to London that We are witnessing in Germany the rebirth the reorganisation and unification of the German nation One may criticise and disapprove one may thoroughly dislike the threatened consummation and be apprehensive of its potentialities But let us make no mistake A machine is being built up in Germany which in the course of this generation if it succeeds unchecked as there is no reason to believe that it will not will be extraordinarily formidable All this was achieved in less than five years Germany is now so strong it can no longer be attacked with impunity and soon the country will be prepared for aggressive action However Henderson saw no reason for alarm writing that we are perhaps entering the quieter phrase of Nazism of which the first indication has been the greater tranquility of the 1937 meeting at Nuremberg Henderson spoke with Hitler at Nuremberg and described him as seeking reasonableness in foreign affairs with a special interest in reaching an AngloGerman understanding Because Hitler in his speech at Nuremberg had demanded that Britain and France return the former German colonies in Africa Henderson came away with the impression that for Hitler the restoration of the German colonial empire in Africa was der Fhrers principle foreign policy interest The British historian Andrew Crozier wrote the thesis developed by the German historian Klaus Hildebrand of colonial blackmail namely that for Hitler the demand for lost colonies in Africa were meant to blackmail Britain into giving Germany a free hand in the East ie Eastern Europe is well supported by the available evidence 

On 16 March 1938 Henderson wrote to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax his view that British interests and the standard of morality can only be combined if we insist upon the fullest possible equality for the Sudeten minority of Czechoslovakia Unlike Basil Newton the British minister in Prague Henderson initially advocated plans to turn Czechoslovakia into a federation writing to Lord Halifax how to secure if we can the integrity of Czechoslovakia At a meeting with Vojtech Mastny the Czechoslovak minister in Berlin on 30 March 1938 Henderson admitted that Czechoslovakia had the best record for the treatment of its minorities in Eastern Europe but criticised Czechoslovakia for being an unitary state which he argued caused too many problems in a state made up of Czechs Slovaks Magyars Germans Poles and Ukrainians Henderson told Mastny that he felt becoming a Federal State was Czechoslovakias best hope and wanted Czechoslovakia to reorient its foreign policy upon PragueBerlinParis axis instead of the existing PragueParisMoscow axis In the spring of 1938 Henderson formed an alliance with Newton to work together to persuade decisionmakers in London to side with Germany against Czechoslovakia When Henderson sent Newton a private letter praising him for his proGerman dispatches on 19 May 1938 the latter replied with a letter saying he hoped Henderson would be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and when that is done I hope I may receive honorable mention You have much the hardest job 

During the May Crisis of 2021 May 1938 Henderson was badly shaken by the partial Czechoslovak mobilisation which for him proved that President Edvard Bene was a dangerous and reckless man At the same time Henderson formed alliances with Baron Ernst von Weizscker the State Secretary of the Auswrtiges Amt Andr FranoisPoncet the French ambassador in Berlin and Baron Bernardo Attolico the Italian ambassador in Berlin to work together to peacfully manage Germanys return to great power status Acting independently of their own national governments Weizscker Attolico Henderson and FranoisPoncet all worked together in a common front on one hand to sabotage the plans of Hitler and Ribbentrop to attack Czechoslovakia while at same time working to ensure the Sudetenland the ostensible object of the GermanCzechoslovak dispute be handed over to Germany Attolico Weizscker  Henderson and FranoisPoncet would meet in secret to discuss in French to share information and to devise strategies for stopping a war in 1938 Weizscker and Henderson both wanted a chemical dissolution of Czechoslovakia instead of the mechanical dissolution ie war favored by Hitler and Ribbentrop After Gring Weizscker was the German official Henderson was most close to during his time in Berlin 
Despite his earlier proYugoslav views Henderson during his time in Berlin started to display strong antiSlavic views writing to Lord Halifax on 22 August 1938 The Teuton and the Slav are irreconcilablejust as are the Briton and the Slav Mackenzie King told me last year after the Imperial Conference that the Slavs in Canada never assimilated with the people and never became good citizens As the crisis over the Sudetenland region intensified in September 1938 Henderson became convinced that Britain should not fight a major war with Germany which jeopardised the British Empire over the Sudetenland all the more so as he believed that it was it unjust for the Treaty of Versailles to have assigned the Sudetenland to Czechoslovakia in the first place In September 1938 Henderson along with Lord Halifax and Sir Horace Wilson the Chief Industrial Adviser to the government were the only ones aware of Chamberlains Plan Z to have the Prime Minister fly to Germany to meet Hitler personally and find out just exactly it was that he wanted with the Sudetenland 

After Hitler gave his keynote speech at the 1938 Nuremberg Party Rally on 12 September 1938 demanding that President Bene either allow the Sudetenland to join Germany or else he would invade Czechoslovakia Henderson who attended the Nuremberg rally reported to London that Hitler driven by the megalomania inspired by the military force which he has built uphe may have crossed the borderline into insanity In the same dispatch Henderson wrote he could not speak with certitude over what Germany might do as everything depends on the psychology of one abnormal individual Henderson spoke with Hitler after he gave his speech at the Party Rally and reported that Hitler even while addressing the Hitler Youth was so nervous that he could not relax leading to Henderson to conclude His abnormality seemed to me even greater than ever Despite Hendersons belief that Hitler might have actually gone mad he still found much to admire about Der Fhrer writing he had sublime faith in his own mission and that of Germany in the world and he is a constructive genius a builder and no mere demagogue Henderson did not believe that Hitler wanted all of Czechoslovakia writing to Lord Halifax that all Hitler wanted was to secure fair and honorable treatment for the Austro and Sudeten Germans even at the price of war but Hitler hates war as much as anyone 

Henderson was ambassador at the time of the 1938 Munich Agreement and counselled Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain to enter into it Shortly thereafter he returned to London for medical treatment returning to Berlin in illhealth in February 1939 he would die of cancer less than four years later Sir Oliver Harvey the Private Secretary to Lord Halifax wrote in September 1938 that Nevile Hendersons very presence here is a danger as he infects the Cabinet with his gibber

In October 1938 Henderson was diagnosed with cancer causing him to leave for London During the interval between October 1938February 1939 the British Embassy in Berlin was run the charge daffairs Sir George OgilvieForbes a member of the Scottish gentry and a protege of Vansittart During this period the dispatches from Berlin changed markedly as OgilvieForbes stated his belief that Hitlers aims went beyond revising the Treaty of Versailles towards winning Germany world power status OgilvieForbes wrote to London 6 December 1938 that based on the information he was receiving that he believed Hitler would start a war sometime in 1939 with Der Fhrer only divided about whatever it would be in western Europe or eastern Europe Unlike Henderson who tended to gloss over the sufferings of the German Jewish community OgilvieForbes gave far more attention to Nazi antisemitism Ascher himself a German Jew noted in OgilvieForbess dispatches to London that there was a real sense of personal empathy with the sufferings of German Jews which Henderson never displayed After Hitler gave his Prophecy Speech to the Reichstag on 30 January 1939 OgilvieForbes predicated that the extermination of Jews in Germany can only be a matter of time Henderson by contrast wrote that Jews and Communists were the principle warmongers that British Jews caused all of the Germanophobia in Britain Jews around the world would move heaven and earth to cause an AngloGerman war and Jews Communists and the intelligentsia were the chief troublemakers in the world To counter the negative reaction caused by the Kristalnacht pogrom in Britain Henderson during his stay in London suggested to Herbert von Dirksen the German ambassador to the Court of St James that henceforward the persecution of German Jews be regularized in an orderly and systematic manner so as not to offend British public opinion so much 

When Henderson returned to Berlin on 13 February 1939 his first action was to call a meeting of the senior staff of the British Embassy where he castigated OgilvieForbes for his negative tone in his dispatches during his absence and announced that henceforward all dispatches to London would have to conform to his views and that any diplomat who reported otherwise would be fired from the Foreign Office On 18 February 1939 Henderson reported to London Herr Hitler does not contemplate any adventures at the momentall stories and rumors to the contrary are completely without foundation In February 1939 Henderson cabled the FCO in London

On 6 March 1939 Henderson sent a lengthy dispatch to Lord Halifax attacking almost everything everything OgilvieForbes had written during his time when he was in charge of the British Embassy Besides for disallowing OgilvieForbes Henderson also attacked British newspapers for negative coverage of Nazi Germany especially the Kristallnacht pogrom and demanded that the Chamberlain government impose censorship to end all negative coverage of the Third Reich Henderson wrote If a free press is allowed to run riot without guidance from higher authority the damage which it may do is unlimited Even war may be one of its consequences Henderson praised Hitler for his sentimentality and wrote the humiliation of the Czechs at the Munich conference was a tragedy but it was Benes own fault for failing to give the Sudeten Germans autonomy when he had the chance Henderson called Kristallnacht a disgusting exhibition which was however comprehensible within limits The German authorities were undoubtedly seriously alarmed lest another Jew emboldened by the success of Grynszpan should follow his example and murder either Hitler or one of themselves 

After Wehrmacht troops on 1516 March 1939 occupied the remaining territory of the Czechoslovak Republic in defiance of the Agreement Chamberlain spoke of a betrayal of confidence and decided to withstand German aggression Henderson handed over a protest note and was intermittently recalled to London Henderson wrote that Nazism has crossed the Rubicon of the purity of race by creating the Protectorate of BohemiaMoravia and the seizure of the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia cannot be justified on any grounds By late March 1939 there was a feeling within the cabinet that Henderson could no longer effectively represent Britain in Berlin but Henderson was kept on for the want of a suitable grand embassy to send him to as a replacement There was talk of sending Henderson to Washington however there were objections that Hendersons tendency to commit calculated indiscretions would not mix well with the American press who were inclined to report any indiscretions by public figures calculated or not The State Department made it clear to the Foreign Office that they felt that Henderson would be an embarrassment in Washington When Henderson asked for leave to visit Canada in the spring of 1939 he was told that he would have to give the Foreign Office copies beforehand of any lectures he planned to give as by this point noone in the Chamberlain government trusted Henderson to speak sensibly about Germany 

On 29 April 1939 the French ambassador in Berlin Robert Coulondre reported to Paris that when Germany occupied the Czech part of CzechoSlovakia on 15 March 1939 that Henderson always an admirer of the National Socialist regime careful to protect Mr Hitlers prestige was convinced that Great Britain and Germany could divide the world between them was very angry when he learned that the Reich had just violated the Munich Agreement as it wounded him in his pride Coulondre went on to write Yesterday I found him exactly as I knew him in February Coulondre added that Henderson had told him that the German demand that the Free City of Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany was justified in his view and the introduction of conscription in Britain did not mean that British policies towards Germany were changing Coulondre concluded it appears that events barely touched Sir Nevile Henderson like water over a mirrorIt would seem that he forgot everything and failed to learn anything Hendersons relations were Coulondre were unfriendly and cold as Coulondre distrusted both him and Weizscker and unlike FranoisPoncet he refused to join the group of four that had met in 1938 to stop a war By early May 1939 Henderson was reporting to London that Hitler still wanted good relations with Britain but only if the British would end the policy of encirclement Henderson further added that he believed in the justice of Hitlers demand that the Free City of Danzig rejoin Germany writing that Danzig was practically a wholly German city and that Hitler did not want a war with Poland through one might break out if his offer to Poland was uncompromisingly rejected

During the Danzig crisis Henderson consistently took the line that Germany was justified in demanding the return of the Free City of Danzig and that the onus was on the Poles to make concessions to Germany by allowing the Free City to go home to the Reich Henderson wrote to Lord Halifax about Danzig and the Polish Corridor Can we allow the Polish government to be too uncompromising with them Henderson felt that the Treaty of Versailles had been unjust towards Germany by creating the Free City of Danzig and giving the Polish Corridor and part of Silesia to Poland and his preferred solution to the crisis was to have Britain pressure the Poles into concessions However Henderson did believe that Britain needed to deter Germany from attacking Poland while Britain pressured the Poles into concessions and for this reason he favored the peace front as the best form of deterrence Despite his distrust of the Soviet Union he did support having the Soviet Union join the peace front as the best way of deterring Germany from invading Poland

On the eve of the Second World War Henderson came into frequent conflict with Sir Alexander Cadogan Permanent UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Henderson argued that Britain should go about rearmament in secret as a public rearmament would encourage the belief that Britain planned to go to war with Germany Cadogan and the Foreign Office disagreed 

With the signing of the MolotovRibbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939 and the AngloPolish military alliance two days later war became imminent On the night of 30 August Ambassador Henderson had an extremely tense meeting with German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop Ribbentrop presented the German final offer to Poland at midnight and warned Henderson that if he received no reply by dawn the final offer would be considered rejected The American historian Gerhard Weinberg described the scene When Ribbentrop refused to give a copy of the German demands to the British Ambassador at midnight of 3031 August 1939 the two almost came to blows Ambassador Henderson who had long advocated concessions to Germany recognised that here was a deliberately conceived alibi the German government had prepared for a war it was determined to start No wonder Henderson was angry von Ribbentrop on the other hand could see war ahead and went home beaming
While negotiating with the Polish ambassador Jzef Lipski and advising accommodation over Germanys territorial ambitions  as he had during the Austrian Anschluss and the occupation of Czechoslovakia  the Nazis staged the Gleiwitz incident and the Invasion of Poland began on 1 September It was Henderson who had to deliver Britains final ultimatum on the morning of 3 September 1939 to Minister Ribbentrop stating that if hostilities between Germany and Poland did not cease by 11 am that day a state of war would exist Germany did not respond and Prime Minister Chamberlain declared war at 1115am Henderson and his staff were briefly interned by the Gestapo before finally returning to Britain on 7 September

After returning to London Henderson asked for another ambassadorship but was denied He wrote Failure of a Mission Berlin 19371939 which was published in 1940 in which he spoke highly of some members of the Nazi regime including Reichsmarschall Hermann Gring but not von Ribbentrop He had been on friendly terms with members of the Astors Cliveden set which also supported appeasement Henderson wrote in his memoirs how eager Prince Paul had been to illustrate his military plans to counter Mussolinis projected assault on Dalmatia when the main body of the Italian Royal Army had been sent overseas The historian A L Rowse described Failure of a Mission as an appalling revelation of fatuity in high place

He died on 30 December 1942 from cancer which he had been suffering from since 1938 He was staying at the Dorchester Hotel in London at the time He never married Informed by his doctors that he had around six months left to live he wrote an anecdotefilled diplomatic memoir Water Under the Bridges posthumously published in 1945 Its final chapter defends his work in Berlin and the policy of appeasement praises the late Prime Minister Chamberlain for being an honest and brave man and argues on behalf of the Munich Agreement on the grounds that Britain was too weak militarily in 1938 to have stood up to Hitler it also argues that if Germany had invaded Czechoslovakia that nation would have fallen in at most a few months

George Washington Harris
George Washington Harris March 20 1814  December 11 1869 was an American humorist best known for his character Sut Lovingood an Appalachian backwoods reveler fond of telling tall tales Harris was among the seminal writers of Southern humor and has been called the most original and gifted of the antebellum humorists His work influenced authors such as Mark Twain William Faulkner and Flannery OConnor

Harris moved to Knoxville Tennessee as a child where he worked variously as a silversmith riverboat captain and farmer His earliest works were political satires published in the Knoxville Argus around 1840 and his earliest attributable works were four sporting stories published in the New York Spirit of the Times in 1843 He wrote his Sut Lovingood tales for various newspapers in the 1850s and 1860s twentyfour of which he compiled and published as his only book Sut Lovingood Yarns Spun By a Natral Born Durnd Fool in 1867 Harris died in Knoxville in 1869 after mysteriously falling ill on a train ride

The details of Harriss early life are obscure His father George Harris and a companion Samuel Bell moved to Pennsylvania in the 1790s Bells son also named Samuel was born in 1798 After the elder Bell died Harris married his widow Margaret Glover Bell and they gave birth to George Washington Harris in Allegheny City now part of Pittsburgh in 1814 In 1819 Harriss halfbrother the younger Samuel Bell completed an apprenticeship at an arms factory and moved to Knoxville to open a jewelry store Harris went with him and was apprenticed at the shop

In 1826 a steamboat known as the Atlas became the first to reach Knoxville from the Mississippi River Harris built a small model of the Atlas and dazzled an audience by sailing it across the socalled Flag Pond on the north side of town At age 15 Harris rode horses in quarter races ie races over a quarter of a mile at tracks in the Knoxville vicinity In 1835 he was hired as captain of the steamboat Knoxville As captain of this vessel later renamed the Indian Chief Harris took part in the Cherokee removal in 1838

In 1839 Harris left the steamboat business and purchased a farm near Maryville Around 1840 he published his first political satires in the Knoxville Argus later renamed the Standard a Democraticleaning newspaper edited by Elbridge Gerry Eastman 18131859 with whom Harris would form a lifelong partnership Since articles in the Argus were typically published under generic pseudonyms it is not known with certainty which articles Harris wrote

By early 1843 Harris had moved back to Knoxville to operate a metalworking shop That same year he published four Sporting Epistles the earliest known works attributable to him in the New York Spirit of the Times In 1845 he published The Knob Dance A Tennessee Frolic in response to a Mississippi writer who had derided East Tennessee as bland and overly obsessed with religion Over the next two years he wrote several more stories for the Spirit culminating with Theres Danger In Old Chairs in 1847

In the late 1840s Harris turned to inventing and claimed to have prepared several articles for Scientific American but no such articles have been found Over the subsequent decade he engaged in various enterprises which included the founding of a glassworks and the cofounding of a sawmill both of which apparently failed He was elected an alderman for Knoxville in 1856 and appointed the citys postmaster the following year

Around 1854 Harris surveyed several copper mines in the Ducktown area in southeast Tennessee While working in the area it is believed he met a local farmer William Sut Miller d 1858 who inspired his bestknown character Sut Lovingood In November 1854 Harris published his first Sut Lovingood tale Sut Lovingoods Daddy Acting Horse which would also be his last entry in the Spirit of the Times For the remainder of the decade his preferred outlet was the Nashville Union and American edited by his old friend Elbridge G Eastman

As the rift between the North and South widened in the years leading up the Civil War Harris an ardent Democrat and secessionist moved to Nashville and began writing political satires in support of the South These included his fourpart story LoveFeast of Varmints which lampooned the Opposition Partys March 1859 Nashville convention and three Sut Lovingood tales in 1861 that attacked President Abraham Lincoln In early 1862 Harris fled Nashville ahead of invading Union forces and spent the remainder of the war evading the Union Army

After the war Harris with the help of future Chattanooga congressman William Crutchfield was appointed president of the Wills Valley Railroad which operated in Georgia and Alabama In 1866 he published Sut Lovingood Come to Life an attack on the Radical Republicans The following year he published his only booklength work Sut Lovingood Yarns Spun By a Natral Born Durnd Fool which was a collection of twentyfour Sut Lovingood tales sixteen of which had been published in various newspapers prior to the war

Following the success of Sut Lovingood Yarns Harris made plans to publish a new collection of stories entitled High Times and Hard Times In late November 1869 he travelled from his new home in Alabama to Lynchburg Virginia to show his manuscript to a prospective publisher On December11 while riding the train back to Alabama Harris fell gravely ill somewhere near Bristol Tennessee When the train stopped in Knoxville Harris unconscious was taken to the Atkin Hotel which stood on North Gay Street

At the Atkin Harris was examined by a doctor who issued a preliminary diagnosis of apoplexy Later in the evening four other doctors arrived including Harriss brotherinlaw John Fouche These doctors rejected the initial diagnosis and suggested a possible morphine overdose Around 1000 PM Harris briefly regained consciousness and managed to say one final word poisoned He died shortly afterward with the official cause listed as unknown No copy of his manuscript High Times and Hard Times has ever been found

Harriss earliest attributable works in the Spirit of the Times were four letters or epistles to the Spirits editor William T Porter The first of these entitled Sporting Epistle from East Tennessee was an account of a raccoon hunt in which the hunters mistook a bulge in a tree for a raccoon The second involves a mountaineer who travels several miles to watch a quarterrace in south Knox County but misses the race due to drinking The third epistle is a collection of anecdotes and observations and mentions a 100pound fish caught at ForksoftheRiver in east Knox County The fourth epistle describes a country dance at Tuckalucky Tuckaleechee Cove in south Blount County

One of Harriss earliest successes was A SnakeBit Irishman which appeared in the Spirit of the Times in 1846 The story involves several hunters in Morgan County who play a prank on an Irishman who had invited himself into their camp The story relies on Irish stereotypes common at the time In A SleepWalking Incident also published in 1846 Harris claimed to have once spent the night with a farm family in northeastern Tennessee during which he sleepwalked his way into bed with the farmers daughters While the enraged farmer threatened to shoot Harris he allowed him a brief headstart on his horse and Harris managed to escape

Sut Lovingood Harriss bestknown figure is a caricature of a stereotypical farmer of rural Southern Appalachia Knoxville historian Jack Neely describes Sut as Huck Finn on amphetamines a manic perverse child of some backwoods holler where Idiocy and Genius fuse into one Sut considers himself somewhat proudly to be a durnder fool than anyone save his own father He is fond of drinking whiskey and chasing girls and relishes exposing hypocritical circuit riders and other religious figures and politicians

Revenge pranks are a common theme in the Sut Lovingood tales In Parson John Bullens Lizards for instance Parson Bullen a fireandbrimstone preacher beats Sut with a club after catching him in the bushes with a girl at a camp meeting Later when Bullen is preaching to a large crowd Sut releases several lizards which crawl up Bullens legs prompting him to strip off his clothes in terror Another target of Suts revenge is Sicily Burns a mountain woman who tricks Sut into drinking baking soda In response Sut causes a bull to wreak havoc at Sicilys wedding

Suts dialect is an exaggerated version of the South Midland dialect commonly called Appalachian English Appalachian characteristics that frequently occur in Suts speech include rintrusion eg orter for ought to hretention eg hit instead of it short e pronounced as short o eg whar for where and trailing tintrusion eg onct for once

Harris was a strong Democrat and his political writings either extolled Democratic leaders or lampooned leaders of opposing parties namely the Whigs and Republicans In his 1856 story Playing Old Sledge For the Presidency Harris has Sut Lovingood recount a dream in which presidential candidates James Buchanan Millard Fillmore and John C Frmont play a card game for the presidency Harriss 1859 story LoveFeast of Varmints mocked the Opposition Partys state convention using anthropomorphic animals to portray party leaders such as John Bell Henry S Foote and Neill S Brown

In 1861 Harris published his threepart attack on Abraham Lincoln entitled Sut Lovingood Travels With Old Abe as His Confidential Friend and Advisor His first writings after the Civil War included Sut Lovingoods Dream and On the Puritan Yankee which defended Southern values In 1868 Harris published The Forthcoming Early Life of Sut Lovingood By His Dad which was a response to The Early Life of Grant By His Father which had appeared in the New York Ledger earlier that year One of Harriss last political stories entitled Well Dads Dead was an allegory bemoaning the decline of the Southern way of life

Authors Mark Twain William Faulkner and Flannery OConnor all acknowledged inspiration from George Washington Harriss work In 1867 Mark Twain wrote a review of Sut Lovingoods Yarns for a San Francisco newspaper in which he suggested the book would sell well in the west but the eastern people will call it course and possibly taboo it Faulkner read the Sut Lovingood yarns with amused appreciation and OConnor ranked him among the top American grotesque writers In the Cormac McCarthy novel Suttree which is set in Knoxville the books title character is called Sut for short which some writers suggest is a reference to Sut Lovingood

The mid20th century brought revived interest in Harriss work Literary historians compiled biographical materials regarding Harriss life and scoured old newspapers to find and catalog Harriss work In 1967 Thomas Inge published a collection of Harriss known works that did not appear in Sut Lovingoods Yarns in 1867 The book was entitled High Times and Hard Times after Harriss lost manuscript

In 2008 George Washington Harriss final resting place was discovered in Brock Cemetery Wildwood Georgia The literarydetective team was a group of scholars and writers from several states including Calhoun Community College faculty members located in Decatur Alabama a local historian from Decatur and a writer based in Georgia On April 20 2008 a monument in his honor was erected at his burial site by Sigma Kappa Delta an honor society for students studying English at twoyear colleges

Thillens Stadium
Thillens Stadium is a twofield baseball stadium in Chicago Illinois It has 2400 seats and an average of 17000 Chicago area children play there each year

Thillens is at the northwest corner of Devon and Kedzie on land now owned by the Chicago Park District

The stadium was founded in 1938 by Mel Thillens Sr owner of Thillens Inc checkcashing business Thillens idea was to have a baseball park that anyone can use rentfree It cost Thillens a total of 6 million to build the park In 1940 the ballpark erected lights for night use In the 1940s 1950s and 1960s both Little League games and mens 16inch softball games were televised from the park by WGNTV with Jack Brickhouse announcing

It was during a Little League telecast in the 1950s that the centerfield camera now a staple of all baseball telecasts was first used According to Brickhouse One of our cameramen Chuck Seatsema told me that the centerfield scoreboard was only a couple hundred feet away He had a feeling that if he put a camera out there wed get a nice shot of the little catcher giving signs and the little batters face over the pitchers shoulder

The centerfield scoreboard contained a picture of the Thillens armored truck Starting in 1974 if any player hit the sign they would win a 5000 savings bond

In 1993 Mel Thillens Sr died but his family continued to operate the field and a nonprofit charitable foundation supported it Over time the foundation could not afford expenses and in March 2005 Thillens Stadium closed The city of Chicago and the Chicago Cubs combined to invest 15 million in repairs and the stadium reopened its doors in June 2006 The park has since been renamed The Stadium at Devon and Kedzie

An area landmark was the giant baseball with the name Thillens on a large pole in the front of the ballpark on Devon Avenue The ball was moved from Boys World a clothing store on Devon that closed in the 1950s Originally the ball spun on the pole

Several years after the Chicago Park District took over the field the Thillens family requested that their family name be removed from the field Mel Thillens Jr was quoted as saying the field wasnt being maintained and the Thillens family and business no longer wanted to be associated with it The Chicago Park District claims to have maintained Thillens so it can continue as a place of historical significance that thousands of children enjoy each year They obliged Mr Thillens request removing the name from the field At about the same time the 60 yearold giant baseball was removed as it was deemed unsafe

The annual Chicago Celebrity Softball games are hosted at Thillens Stadium Those games have featured Michael Jordan Chris Chelios Minnie Mioso Rich Melman Ferguson Jenkins Randy Hundley Billy Williams and Moose Skowron

On July 28 2009 the Chicago Bandits played the USSSA Pride in a National Pro Fastpitch womens softball game

Lovell Beach House
The Lovell Beach House is located on the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach California The building was completed in 1926 and is now recognized as one of the most important works by architect Rudolf Schindler second only to the Schindler House built four years earlier for his family as a show house and studio Both of these early houses by Schindler are considered landmarks of early modern architecture in America

The residence is on the ocean front not far from The Wedge at Newport Harbor in a tightly packed neighborhood of buildings The house is sheltered from the street on the west side by raising the living quarters above the ground level The open space below reveals the reinforced concrete frames that were formed in the shape of a figure 8 Two stairways pass through the openings in the frames leading to the kitchen and the main entry The garage is on the north side of the ground floor and the garden is on the south side between the house and the beach

The interior is arranged around a twostory livingdining room with full height curtain wall windows on the east and south side facing the ocean The kitchen and breakfast area are located on the north side of the first floor with a terrace on the ocean side over the garden Lamps and builtin furniture were provided as part of the original design Bedrooms on the second floor are connected by a corridor overlooking the main living room Each of the bedrooms originally had access to an open sleeping porch but these were enclosed by Schindler in 1928

The client for the project Philip M Lovell was inspired by a style of healthy living with guidelines for proper diet and exercise Schindler also adopted these principles and addressed these concerns in the design of the beach house The arrangement of the living quarters on the north side of the house maximizes the circulation of fresh air Each bedroom is furnished with windows for cross ventilation to eliminate the need for air conditioning

Lovell also commissioned another house in Los Angeles The Lovell Health House was completed in 1929 on Dundee Drive in Los Angeles three years after the Beach House was finished This commission was awarded to Richard Neutra who was living with his wife in a part of Schindlers House and studio between 1926 and 1930 These two architects created houses that became classic forms of the new California residential design and icons of the Modern movement in America

The Los Angeles branch of the Historic American Buildings Survey HABS documented the house in 1968 The house today has much the same appearance as the photographs taken during the survey The significance of the house was already apparent at the time

The Lovell Beach House is generally considered one of the greatest works of pioneering modern architect R M Schindler It demonstrates an early use of concrete which predates and predicts the postwar Brutalist style in which concrete is left unsurfaced and structure is distinct from enclosure

 The house is lifted above its beach site and cradled in five concrete frames in the shape of figure 8s These were poured in place The enclosed areas were shopfabricated and hoisted into position The play of forms in the advancing and receding planes are related to the De Stijl movement begun in the Netherlands in 1917

The Beach House was listed as a Registered Historic Place in California on February 5 1974

Edward Knight Collins
Edward Knight Collins I 5 August 1802  22 January 1878 was an American shipping magnate

He was born on August 5 1802 in Truro Massachusetts to Israel Gross Collins 17761831 and Mary Ann Knight c1780c1802 His mother was a niece of Sir Edward Knight and she died shortly after Edward was born His aunts then raised him His father moved to New York City At age thirteen in 1815 Collins left Truro for New Jersey to attend school He then went to New York City as an apprentice clerk in the counting house of McCrea and Slidell Within a few years Edward moved to Delaplaine and Company

In 1821 he joined his fathers company and in January 1824 he became a partner in I G Collins  Son In 1827 they started the first regularly scheduled packet service between New York City and Veracruz Mexico In 1826 Collins married Mary Ann Woodruff the daughter of Thomas T Woodruff They had a son Edward K Collins II as well as a daughter and at least one other child

After his fathers death in 1831 he became involved with the cotton trade between New Orleans and New York He bought his first shipping line in 1831 In 1836 he launched the Dramatic Line of sailing packets which quickly became a major presence on what was then the worlds most important shipping route between New York and Liverpool He received a government subsidy in 1847 to carry mail on that same route for which purpose he formed the New York and Liverpool United States Mail Steamship Company the Collins Line to compete with Britains Cunard Line The new Lines inaugural voyage took place in April 1850 and for the next six years its steamships were the biggest fastest and most luxurious on the Atlantic They were hugely expensive to operate however and in 1852 Collins was forced to go back to Congress to secure a major increase in his subsidy for carrying mail This left him in a very vulnerable position when the increase was canceled in 1856 after two of the Lines four steamships sank the Arctic had sunk in 1854 while carrying his wife and two of his children and less than two years later the Pacific disappeared without a trace on her way back from Liverpool to New York The Collins Line struggled on for another couple of years using the insurance payouts for its two lost ships to build an even bigger steamer called the Adriatic But after its subsidy was reduced it simply could not make ends meet and in February 1858 the Line finally folded

Collins moved to his summer home Collinwood in Wellsville Ohio where he engaged in coal mining and oil drilling He remarried to Sarah Browne and by 1862 he had moved back to New York City where he died on January 22 1878 He was buried in an unmarked grave in Woodlawn Cemetery Bronx

Cable in the Classroom
Cable in the Classroom was an American division of the National Cable  Telecommunications Association that assisted the cable television industry in providing educational content to schools The organization was founded in 1989 A Canadian organization also called Cable in the Classroom La cbloducation in French was founded in 1995 and held the same scope as the US organization

Cable stations broadcast educational television programs at specific times usually early in the morning commercialfree and notified Cable in the Classroom as to when the shows would air which maintained a master list for educators to reference This way educators were able to record the programs for free and use them in school as learning tools for children Copyrights were cleared so that educators could use the content of the listed programs as they wished for their syllabi and learning plans

Over the years however many networks discontinued any effort at promoting Cable in the Classroom or setting aside programming for the organizations purposes ceding more to direct marketing of their educational television programming to teachers and school districts via their home video departments their Internet sites or in the cases of networks such as ABC Family Disney Channel and Cartoon Network removing their involvement altogether commensurate with the Internet ending other cable services tied to traditional scheduling such as near video on demand Another factor was likely the decline in VHS recorders as DVRs with nonportable storage became the recording format of choice over DVD recorders the equivalent successor to VCRs Streaming video also played a factor in the reduction of Cable in the Classroom as educators can now access and play content at any time via computers connected to inclassroom televisions and video projectors rather than on a set schedule

In 2014 Cable in the Classroom was entirely discontinued in the United States with CNN Student News the only program left under the effort and the NCTA redirected the former Cable in the Classroom portal to promote their Cable Impacts Foundation charity arm instead

Titanic Days is Kirsty MacColls fourth studio album released in 1993 Containing eleven tracks Titanic Days was sometimes hard to get in years after its release but it was remastered and rereleased in 2005 by ZTT with a second CD of nonalbum tracks and some live recordings including a version of Miss Otis Regrets In 2012 another remastered reissue of the album was released by SalvoZTT which again featured a second disc of bonus tracks

Following her 1991 album Electric Landlady MacColl returned to the studio to record the followup Titanic Days However in 1992 when Virgin was sold to EMI MacColl was dropped from the label resulting in Titanic Days being recorded without being backed by a record deal When the album was completed ZTT Records agreed to release the album as a oneoff release

The album was recorded at a time when MacColls marriage to Steve Lillywhite was disintegrating As such the albums material reflected her personal issues at that time The album was recorded in a small home studio at Ealing due to the limited budget The musicians who appeared on the recordings largely from MacColls own live band had agreed to wait for payment for their contributions until a record deal was agreed upon MacColl and her band spent two days at Townhouse Studios in London where all the backing tracks were recorded

Streaker video game
Streaker is an arcade adventure game published by Mastertronic on their Bulldog label in 1987 The game runs on Amstrad CPC MSX and Sinclair ZX Spectrum

The hero of the game is Carlin a naked man who has been mugged and stripped and needs to find all of his clothes Carlin is in a town on the planet Zuggi which resembles a town in Earth in many ways with locations including an hotel a cafe a supermarket and a chemists shop As Streaker finds more clothes he is able to enter more and more locations The game is won when he is fully dressed

The game is an arcade adventure somewhere between a puzzlebased adventure game and an action game Gameplay is controlled through a nested menu system as in Mastertronics Spellbound There are a multitude of items in the game many of which can be used and some of which seem to have no purpose Streaker can pick up keys to open doors eat food items to raise his hunger levels and needs to solve a number of simple puzzles

While most aspects of life on Zuggi are very similar to Earth there are a number of fantastic elements in the world For example Streaker may teleport beam transfer by using a number of different coloured beamers These will teleport Streaker to the location of the corresponding beampad These beampads can be moved by Streaker and are a good way to avoid thieves Nice touches include Streakers ability to advance time by acquiring a stopwatch the game is played in real time and you often need to wait for a particular location to open and the Save and Load options appearing after Streaker picks up a Tape Recorder

Streakers quest is made more difficult by the presence of a number of thieves They will steal Streakers clothes on contact or cause him to lose a life if he is naked The clothes may be regained from the thieves by finding and offering the thief an item that he wants

The thieves are as follows

Despite the rather unusual aim of the game there does not seem to be any prurient content therein During the 1980s young children occasionally unwittingly perplexed and embarrassed their teachers by telling them they had spent an evening playing Streaker

Ruby Holler
Ruby Holler 2002 is a low fantasy novel for children by the American writer Sharon Creech published by HarperCollins in 2002 It features adolescent orphan twins who are trouble and an eccentric older couple who adopt them and take them back to live in magical Ruby Holler hollow

Creech won the annual Carnegie Medal from the British librarians recognizing the years best childrens book published in the UK Bloomsbury Childrens Books In a retrospective citation the librarians call it a beautifully written story about love and trust and how the strength and goodness of human beings can overcome all the odds Creech was the first American winner of the British award and the first person to win both the American Newbery Medal Walk Two Moons 1994 and the British Carnegie

The story starts in the Boxton Creek Home an orphanage run by the Trepids  a strict and dishonest husband and wife An imaginative thirteenyearold boy named Dallas and his sassy and bold twin sister Florida have been living in the Home for a long time often punished for breaking rules that the Trepids post all over the house Over the years the twins have been adopted many times and quickly returned to the Home Because of this they have been named the trouble twins They have a plan to run away and take a train to a destination far from Boxton

Outside of Boxton on a plot of land called Ruby Holler Tiller and Sairy Morey a very old couple whose children have grown up and moved away are discussing their plans for a new adventure The two decide to foster children and they adopt Dallas and Florida Although Sairy a very kind and trusting old lady is excited about having children at Ruby Holler again Tiller  a crotchety old boot  is doubtful The twins enjoy the freedom and adventure they find in the holler but theyre still suspicious and think that Tiller and Sairy will mistreat them the way others have  although their suspicions soon prove false Tiller and Sairy tell Dallas and Florida they have been planning separate trips and they want the twins to come Dallas with Sairy to explore an island and Florida with Tiller on a rafting trip All four are uneasy about a separation from their lifelong partner but they dont speak about this Tiller and Sairy use their understone funds underground savings that theyve kept for years to pay for their travels

Meanwhile Mr Trepid hears about the understone funds from Dallas and Florida when they run into each other in Boxton shopping for trip supplies Mr Trepid promises to pay a shady man called Z who is a neighbor of Tiller and Sairy to map out Ruby Holler He doesnt say why he needs a map and Z feels uneasy because he likes Tiller and Sairy He slowly begins the map while also helping the Ruby Holler family prepare for their trips Dallas and Florida however still think that Tiller and Sairy are trouble and they decide to take some supplies and equipment and run away They dont get far from the cabin Sairy and Tiller find them camping out and tell the twins it was a good idea to test the supplies and equipment They suggest taking practice trips together closer to home While on their practice trips Tiller and Sairy learn about the twins past and realize that the Trepids are not trustworthy people

The four start out on their trips to the river and the island Z continues to stall with production of Mr Trepids map feeling more protective of the kids since he believes that Dallas and Florida may really be his biological children he sees their birth certificate birth certificate and it looks as if their mother was Zs runaway wife Eventually he gives Mr Trepid a map that shows possible hiding places but Z has removed the understone funds to protect them from Mr Trepid On Tiller and Floridas small trip while rafting down a river their boat capsizes and Tiller suffers a heart attack Luckily Dallas Sairy and Z find them in time and Tiller is taken to a hospital where he recovers Z bonds with the twins and they set up traps for Mr Trepid who looks for the understone funds but fails to find them

In the end two of Tiller and Sairys biological children visit the Holler to check on Tillers health and suggest that the twins go back to the Boxton Creek Home Dallas and Florida hear their conversation and run away again before hearing Tiller and Sairys denial In the morning Dallas and Florida smell their breakfast cooking as usual and return home to the cabin in Ruby Holler

Dallas Dallas is one of the protagonists of the novel He is thirteen years old and was abandoned by his mother as an infant and lived at the Boxton Creek Home for his whole life except when he was adopted and sent back by families that saw him and his sister as trouble He is very imaginative and silent often letting Florida speak for them both He often thinks situations will turn out for the best although he is often proven wrong When a resident of the Boxton Creek Home was dying Mr Trepid told Dallas to save him but he fails and the child dies He somewhat admires Z and is close friends with Sairy

Florida Florida is Dallass twin sister Like him she was abandoned to the orphanage at a young age and was sent to many homes with Dallas and then returned and the two are very close to each other She is very bold and outspoken and very hateful of almost everything She often thinks that she and Dallas can take care of themselves although she does sometimes show care for others When Florida first enters Ruby Holler she is very suspicious of Tiller and Sairy thinking they will be like other families before She does not know how to swim which is unfortunate when she falls out of the boat on a rafting trip although she knows basic CPR which she uses to revive Tiller after his heart attack

Sairy Sairy is an old woman who lives in Ruby Holler with her husband She is very kind and compassionate especially with children She also is very trusting Her dream is to have another adventure before she dies She once lived in New York City and Tiller wrote to her every week from Ruby Holler Eventually she left the city and married Tiller She has four children that are adults and have left Ruby Holler

Tiller Tiller is Sairys cranky husband He is about her age and unlike her is distrusting and doubtful much like Florida He was born on a houseboat and then lived in Ruby Holler all his life When all his children left he planted a tree in their memory but it is accidentally chopped down by Dallas and Florida His plan is to build a boat with Florida and take a rafting trip down a river During the trip the boat falls over in rough waters and he suffers a heart attack although he eventually recovers

Z Z whose full name is never revealed is Tiller and Sairys neighbor Hes described as a shady figure who helps Mr Trepid find the understone funds in exchange for a large amount of money He is not very responsible but he easily learns helpful information He helps the Ruby Holler family prepare for their trips during which he learns that Dallas and Florida are his children when he sees Dallass birth certificate and sees his exwifes name listed as his mother He is very good friends with Tiller and Sairy and helpful to them

Mr Trepid Mr Trepid coruns the Boxton Creek Home with his wife and assistant He is very strict posting rules in every room of the house and punishing the children who break the rules with chores or time in the basement thinking corner He is also greedy dreaming of expensive luxuries and an easy life When he hears about Tiller and Sairys understone funds he hires Z to help him find the money

Mrs Trepid Mrs Trepid is Mr Trepids wife who also runs the orphanage Like her husband she is strict with children and dreams about an easier life She often claims to suffer from constant migraines and is suspicious of her husbands actions to earn more money

In a contemporary review for The Guardian Philip Pullman remarked on Ruby Hollers largerthanlife brighterthannatural quality and concluded that while neither great literature nor the authors best work its a book that shows how very satisfying unobtrusive craftsmanship can be even working with slight materials and its fun and it celebrates kindness and decency Regarding the main plot line he observed that its not hard to predict that there will be problems to overcome and dangers to face but that theyll all live happily ever after Creech makes it work for all kinds of readers by a complete certainty of tone and by putting the camera in the right place In particular and unusually for a childrens book she distributes her attention equally among the adults and the children She looks at whatever is interesting whatever moves the story forward and tells us what she sees and never tells us more than we need

Creech traveled to London for five days in July 2003 to receive the Carnegie Medal Concluding online coverage for The Guardian Dina Rabinovitch called Ruby Holler an oldfashioned tale of two children in peril rescued by the wisdom of two old folk What sets it apart is Creechs typical lightness of touch the glancing way she writes means you barely realise that even in this solid love story of older folk the wife is less sure of marriage than the man

Robert Cawdrey
Robert Cawdrey ca 1538  after 1604 was an English clergyman who produced one of the first dictionaries of the English language the Table Alphabeticall in 1604

Robert Cawdrey did not attend university but became a school teacher in Oakham Rutland in 1563 In 1565 Cawdrey was ordained deacon and priest in 1570 and on 22 October 1571 he was made rector of South Luffenham in Rutland However Cawdrey was sympathetic to Puritan teachings and got in trouble with the Church authorities In 1576 he was chastised for not reading the approved texts in his sermons and in 1578 he performed a marriage even though he was not authorized to do so and was briefly suspended His suspension lasted only a few months but in 1586 he was again in trouble for violating the rules and was called before his bishop Richard Howland He had powerful friends among them his patron Lord Burghley who tried to defend him but he was deprived of his rectory in 1588 and had to return to teaching to support himself

With the assistance of his son Thomas Cawdrey 15751640 who was a school teacher in London Robert Cawdrey decided to create an instructional text the Table Alphabeticall which appeared in 1604 when Cawdrey was living in Coventry

As many new words were entering the English language in the 16th century Cawdrey became concerned that people would become confused Cawdrey worried that the wealthy were adopting foreign words and phrases and wrote that they forget altogether their mothers language so that if some of their mothers were alive they were not able to tell or understand what they say He also described how far journied gentlemen learn new words while in foreign lands and then pouder their talke with oversea language

Thomas Cawdrey worked on improvements to the Table Alphabeticall

While he was a rector Robert Cawdrey wrote A Short and Fruitefull Treatise of the Profit of Catechising in 1580 He revised this work and published a second edition in 1604 Cawdrey also published A Treasurie or StoreHouse of Similes in 1600 and again in 1609

The full name of his famous dictionary is A table alphabeticall conteyning and teaching the true writing and understanding of hard vsuall English wordes borrowed from the Hebrew Greeke Latine or French c With the interpretation thereof by plaine English words gathered for the benefit  helpe of ladies gentlewomen or any other unskilfull persons Whereby they may the more easilie and better vnderstand many hard English wordes vvhich they shall heare or read in scriptures sermons or elswhere and also be made able to vse the same aptly themselues

His dictionary contained about 2500 words He was careful to explain the alphabetical order to his readers which even the most literate of his readers would not know or expect Nowe if the word which thou art desirous to finde begin with a then looke in the beginning of this Table but if with v looke towards the end

Robert Cawdrey had many sons His youngest son Daniel Cawdrey ca 15881664 was a Puritan minister

Huntley Project
The Huntley Project is an irrigation project in southern Montana that was established by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 1907 The district includes the towns of Huntley Worden Ballantine and Pompeys Pillar

Since the Huntley Project was established the districts main cash crops have been sugar beets and alfalfa Silage for the local cattle industry is also important

Bisonhunting Plains Indians especially the Cheyenne Crow and Sioux frequented this region south of the Yellowstone River from the 17th century William Clark passed through in July 1806 with members of the Corps of Exploration and inscribed his name on Pompeys Rock The Yellowstone River provided a route into this sagebrushcovered country for white fur trappers hunters and settlers The US Army made war on the Indian tribes over several decades and the famous Battle of Little Bighorn took place nearby in June 1876 

The district that now includes the Huntley Project was designated as part of the Crow Indian Reservation under a treaty ratified on May 7 1868 This preserved the area from occupation by white homesteads and cattle ranches but by 1880 the virtual extinction of the bison made the traditional Crow economy impossible to sustain By 1895 Crow farmers successfully irrigated and farmed part of the reservation which had been considered an arid wasteland 

In 1882 the city of Billings linked to the Northern Pacific Railroad was founded within a few miles of the Crow reservation In 1904 the United States government obtained the northern part of the reservation by cession from the Crow Indians Congress authorized the Reclamation Service of the US Department of the Interior to survey the land for a possible irrigation project The Huntley Project the fifth federal project to convert arid western land to farmland was authorized in April 1905 and construction began in October Despite cost overruns and unforeseen problems the Pryor Division of the project including Worden and Ballantine was completed and receiving water by 1907

The project took its name from the town of Huntley a station on the Northern Pacific Railroad In 1907 the new Huntley Project townsites of Worden Ballantine and Pompeys Pillar were laid out at intervals of about six miles along the railroad On May 21 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt declared the Pryor Division to be open for settlement Farm units were distributed by lottery but the pace of settlement may have been slowed by lottery fanatics from nearby Billings who drew numbers out of idle curiosity with no intention of settling on the land Of the first 1000 names drawn only 76 applied for a farm unit The population of Huntley Project farms rose to 2107 in 1917 but fell again to a probable low of 1015 in 1923

Much of the irrigation infrastructure of the Huntley Project had been poorly designed and cheaply built and replacements were soon needed Growing demand for water required more irrigation canals and an auxiliary pumping station and by 1913 problems with inadequate drainage had caused hundreds of acres of arid land to become waterlogged Settlers found that alkali in the soil made it difficult to profitably farm the area and many farms failed in the recession following World War I Poor crop yields made it difficult for farmers to pay their portion of the districts costs so Reclamation refused to fund needed improvements Tensions between Reclamation and the district farmers peaked during the 1920s until on January 2 1927 the two sides settled their dispute with a new contract 

Low water and dry weather in the 1930s led to the construction of the first retention dam then a concrete weir in 1934 The Anita Dam and Reservoir project about six miles southeast of Ballantine was completed in 1937 by Civilian Conservation Corps workers

I Stand Alone Al Kooper album
I Stand Alone is American singersongwriter Al Koopers 1969 debut album issued on Columbia Records It was recorded after his collaboration with Michael Bloomfield and Stephen Stills on the 1968 album Super Session

After ten years of session playing collaborations and playing in other bands Kooper released his first solo album in February 1969 It is an eclectic mix of country soul blues and rock with a dose of psychedelia mixed throughout It is a continuation of Super Session in its mix of disparate covers from the likes of Bill Monroe Harry Nilsson and Traffic and with originals running the gamut of feelings

Unlike the Super Session album however the spotlight is on Kooper alone and Koopers alternate utilization of orchestras and professional Nashville studio musicians the tracks are far more focused all within two and five minutes Camille is lifted from Overture to Le Domino Noire by French composer Daniel Auber

Most tracks are bridged with sound effects taken from albums issued by Elektra Records The Overture begins with a collage of sound effects also taken from those albums While it seems distracting now it is a product of the era that it was recorded in The album was on the Billboard 200 charts for 13 weeks peaking at 54 on March 15 1969

City of Bangor ship
City of Bangor was a freighter that had a 30year career on the Great Lakes Originally designed to carry ore the ship was converted into an automobile carrier in 1925 She was trapped in ice on Lake Superior November 30 1926 and after multiple salvage attempts Bangor was declared a total loss

City of Bangor was captained by William J Mackin On the night of November 30 1926 Bangor was carrying 248 new Chrysler automobiles from Detroit Michigan to Duluth Minnesota when a severe storm drove her onto the rocks of the Keweenaw Peninsula on Michigans Upper Peninsula Eighteen cars that were spiked to the deck of the ship slipped overboard and were lost During the same storm Thomas Maytham which was carrying 20000 tons of grain from Duluth to Toledo Ohio went aground on the other side of the peninsula

The next morning after the winds had subsided Bangors crew managed to free the lifeboats and by afternoon all the men had made it ashore They began to walk to the nearest village Copper Harbor which was about 15 miles away but became lost in the unfamiliar territory They spent the night with a fire but no shelter inadequate clothing and no food

The next day a United States Coast Guard rescue lifeboat out of Eagle Harbor Life Saving Station came around the point while carrying Thomas Maythams crew and discovered Bangors crew The Coast Guard captain dropped off the men from Thomas Maytham at Copper Harbor and returned for the men from City of Bangor The men were exhausted and suffering from hypothermia several were hospitalized with frostbite

The majority of the Chryslers were in the hold separated from the flooded engine room by a strong partition A visual inspection of the hold showed that the cars were in good condition When the water around the wrecked ship had frozen solid an ice ramp was constructed and the cars were driven off the ship The area around the Keweenaw Peninsula was heavily forested and buried in about of snow so the cars were driven along the icy banks of the lake to Copper Harbor When the roads opened in the spring the cars were driven to Calumet Michigan loaded onto trains and taken to Detroit for repair and resale City of Bangor herself was a total loss but 202 of the vehicles were salvaged from the wreck and sold

The City of Bangor wreck site is now part of the Keweenaw Underwater Preserve established in 1991 along with the nearby wrecks of Altadoc and Scotia and she can be visited by scuba divers The only remaining part of the Eagle Harbor Life Saving Station the boathouse is now a museum containing shipwreck memorabilia including one of the 1927 Chryslers from City of Bangor

As the daughter of Prince RomanovskyIskander n  and his first wife Olga Iosifovna Rogowska b 1893 disappeared in the USSR d c 1962 daughter of Iosif Rogowski RomanovskayaIskander was the granddaughter of Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich the disgraced grandson of Tsar Nicholas I thus she was a patrilineal greatgreatgranddaughter of Nicholas I Her date of birth is disputed and has been reported as 10 February 1916 3 February 1917 or 17 February 1910

Grand Duke Constantine Nicholaevichs son Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich was exiled to Central Asia in disgrace for stealing his mothers diamonds Grand Duke Nicholas established a palace in Tashkent and lived in grand style where he sired a son whom Tsar Alexander III his greatuncle granted the title Prince Iskander Iskander was the Arabic form of Alexander

This prince Alexander Nikolaievich 15 November 1887 NS  26 January 1957 who granted the name of Iskander and the rank of a Noble of the Russian Empire by Imperial Ukase 1889 and that of Hereditary Noble by Imperial Ukase 1899 also granted the title of Prince RomanovskyIskander with the qualification of Serene Highness by the Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia who became the grandfather of Princess Natalia in absentia in 1925 in turn fathered the Princess Iskander Alexander Nikolaievich only had issue by his first wife

Natalia Androsova was born in Tashkent a member of the Constantinovichi branch of the Russian Imperial Family She had an older brother Prince Kirill RomanovskyIskander 19141992 Her parents who had been married since 5 May 1912 separated and in 1924 Natalia and her brother moved with their mother to Moscow first moved to Plyushchikha Street later to Old Arbat where Olga remarried to Nicholas Androsov Natalias stepfather adopted her and her brother so Princess Iskander was renamed Natalia Nikolaievna Androsova  Her father remarried also to Natalia Hanykova b Saint Petersburg 3020 December 1893 d Nice 20 April 1982 dau of MajGen Constantin Nikolaievich Hanykov and his wife Natalia Efimovna Markova on 11 October 1930 in Paris

After the Russian Revolution Natalia and her brother Kirill were the only two Romanov descendants in the male line in the USSR the rest either left or were killed They lived their entire lives in the USSR She was married to Nicholas Vladimirovich Dostal 1909  22 April 1959 and had a daughter Eleonora Nikolaievna DostalOru 27 January 1937  2009 Her daughter was a socialite philanthropist noblewoman and an example of the modern phenomenon of the celebutante who rose to fame not because of her talent but because of her inherited wealth and controversial lifestyle in Turkey The biographical novel The White Night of St Petersburg 2004 was written by her second cousin Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark about her grandfather Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich of Russia and was based on Natalias memories of him She was a friend of Alexander Galich Yuri Nikulin Yuri Nagibin and Alexander Vertinsky Princess Natalia is also known for her brave personality She was a motorcyclist in motorcyclistcircus Besides in the war time she was a driver in army

When the revolution progressed the Iskander family decided that it was safer in Central Asia and joined the old grand duke in Tashkent the place where Natalias early childhood had been spent Natalia was barely one year old when her grandfather was killed by local revolutionaries the first grand duke to die in the Red Terror The family never discussed the circumstances of his death and now no one knows exactly what happened Her father and uncle Artemi left home to join the Whites and for a time the two Iskander princes were lost in the swirling havoc of civil war Prince Alexander was reported missing in action Meanwhile the revolutionaries forced Natalia her brother Kirill and her mother Olga to leave the grand ducal palace but they did not persecute them

The family were helped by the fact that their name was Iskander not Romanov but even more by the preoccupation of the revolutionaries with their own survival in a bitter seesaw civil war After the war the palace became a museum and little Natalia would visit it aware of the fact that it had once been her home and that all its treasuresarmor sculpture paintingshad once belonged to her family The lavish rose garden shielded by its high walls from Asian dust and harsh deserd winds continued to bloom And in the cellar a few hunting dogs still lived Their master was gone but they waited for his return Peace meant that the Bolsheviks would have the opportunity to become interested in the Iskander family conspicuous because of the memory of the grand duke Nicholas Constantinovich had spent his own personal funds to build canals for irrigating the crops essential for sustaining the life of the people But Natalias mother knew she could expect no gratitude from the Bolsheviks and decided that she would take her family to Moscow

Giving up her husband for lost she married and changed the name of her children immediately to that of her new husband Thus Natalia dropped Iskander for Androsova Moscow offered new jobs and also safety in anonymity of big city life Former tsarist officers bureaucrats professors and merchants hoped to find privacy and security in the bustling new capital of the Soviet regime The newAndrosovs found a spacious apartment but a neighbor apparently wanting the place himself and learning who they really were threatened to report them to the secret police

The family fled to the Arbat District downtown near the Kremlin and to the squalor of a cramped basement apartment Because they were neither peasants nor workers the state gave them the status of lishentzy people regarded as socially alien having no right to vote and therefore unable to secure good jobs Yet they survived Natalia had grown up to be dazzling in appearance and dashing in manner Tall and svelte with finely chiseled and also very Romanov features she had radiant blue eyes long blond hair and a captivating smile Her mother despite changing her name never tried to conceal the past from Natalia All the family photographs sat on a shelf in the shabby Androsov apartment Grand Duke Nicholas Constantinovich his brother KR and Natalias father Prince Alexander Iskander

Natalia would proudly tell close friends of her real origins Everyone was astonished one of the friends said disgustedly Put those pictures away it is indecent to keep them But the Androsovs were bold Friends returning from Siberian exile political pariahs always knew that they could spend a few nights with the Androsovs Natalia perhaps inherited some of her grandfathers propensity for adventure She did not conceal that she was a Romanov

She chose a wild career that of a professional motorcyclist She joined the famous sports club Dynamo and became a prominent motorcycle racer Then the troubles came It was 1939 Russia was experiencing Joseph Stalins Great Terror when millions were taken away to die often inexplicably Natalia was twentytwo A young mechanic from Dynamo came courting her When she boasted of her imperial lineage he tried to blackmail her into sleeping with him When she refused he threatened to report her to the Lubyanka Married and the mother of one Natalia slapped him hard across the face He was very tall and muscular but I was a very strong woman she said proudly Still she panicked and burned all of her family papers She changed her sports club and went to another famous one Spartak But in several weeks the Lubyanka summoned her The secret police people were explicit She had only two options they said Either she became a secret agent or she would be shot

Under the codename Lola Natalia began to work for Stalins secret police Her Lubyanka supervisor came regularly to the Arbat where they met not in her apartment but in the shadows of an archway outside Years later Natalia learned that her file at the Lubyanka described her in the most flattering terms She was young intelligent and attractive She had in short all the qualities of an excellent agent except one She did not want the job Her friends knew nothing of her Lubyanka affiliation But she knew which of them would be arrested and when
Many people found Natalias manner pleasingly raffish she dressed in mens jackets and leggins She smoked She was proud of her ancestry especially her grand ducal grandfather She liked to whisper the guests that she was a Romanov a descendant of tsars Soon she became known as the Queen of the Arbat a district that was taking on some of the character of New Yorks Greenwich Village Visitors found hers a warm hearth in a cold and gray metropolis She embarked on an extraordinary career as a vertical motorcyclist at Gorky Park She drove the machine up a wall The secret to success she said was to feel the vehicle and to look only forward never at the wheels Then the war broke out

In 1941 Nazi Germany invaded Russia In the fall of that year when the enemy came very close to capturing Moscow and the Soviet Government fled Natalia stayed in the city She was in charge of her neighborhood fire brigade on the alert for incendiary bombs dropped by German aircraft When these bombs hit the ground they exploded and shot out a sea of flames One had to catch the moment of impact and throw sand over the bomb to smother it before the explosion Impatient Natalia would often seize the hissing bomb itself and throw it into the sand Sometimes the whitehot bodies of bombs buried themselves deeply into the asphalt setting even that aflame and at night explosions and fires burst out everywhere with people shouting and horses neighing in terror

Natalia also joined a paramilitary militia as a motorcyclist courier When she came to her Arbat neighborhood dressed exotically in a brown velvet jacket army boots and breeches some passerby unused to such extravagant dress detained her as German saboteur Natalia took another job driving a truck delivering bread to the troops at the front and clearing snow from downtown streets afterward She discovered that she had talent for mechanical matters and she could keep her truck in good repair As early as the summer 1942 Stalin feeling more secure about the course of the war decided that it was time to cheer up his people He ordered more performances in Moscow theater concerts opera and the circus

Natalia returned to her earlier career as a vertical motorcyclist In the summer of 1953 just after Stalins death they gave her a new assignment promising it would be her last Her career as a motercyclist soared She was at the top of her profession and toured of the USSR She used the worlds best motorcycles such as Harley Davidsons and Indian Scouts But her performance called Fearless Flight by people around her was always dangerous Sometimes she would spend a month in the hospital nursing broken bones

Natalia became friendly with the leading Moscow bohemians of the day and they dedicated their poems and stories to her In July 1964 eligible for a pension she retired But when she stopped performing the world began to forget her and her life took on a smaller dimension In the late 1998 in her tiny studio apartment the last Romanov in Russia and the only Russian among Romanovs lived with her puppy dog which she found dying in the street The dog was suffering from pneumonia and had been severely beaten She picked him up remembering the mournful howls of her grandfathers dogs when the grand duke was gone She named the dog Malysh Baby and Malysh has grown up a healthy gingercolored mongrel friendly to visitors passionately attached to Natalia On her crutches she took the dog for walks herself even in wintertime when the sidewalks were frozen Throughhout this term her daughter and stepsons took care of her She owned little of the great Romanov treasure only her grandfathers crested silver spoons a silver cup made for the coronation of Empress Elizabeth in 1742 a small decorative box a cross and a tiny hinged icon Whatever else of value she inherited she had to sell in hard times But material objects seemed not of great importance to her In 1999 she died of old age at the age of 82

Panchakuta Basadi or Panchakoota Basadi is a temple complex located in the Kambadahalli village of the Mandya district Karnataka state in southwestern India It is one of the finest examples of South Indian Dravidian architecture of the Western Ganga variety related to the Jain faith and iconography According to the historian KR Srinivasan the temple complex which was built by the kings of the Western Ganga Dynasty is assignable to the period 9001000 CE The historian I K Sarma however assigns an earlier date of 8th century based on traces of early PallavaPandya and ChalukyaPallava influences Kambadahalli whose name in the Kannada language literally translates to village with pillar which is located 18km from the famous Jain heritage town of Shravanabelagola on the MandyaShravanabelagola highway gets its name from the Brahmadeva pillar Manasthambha erected in front of the temple complex From inscriptions it is known that the temple complex has been renovated during later centuries including the during the rule of the Hoysala Empire The monument is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India as a national monument Srinivasan describes it as a landmark in South India architecture

The temple was built in two phases In the first phase three shrines were constructed trikutachala three shrines each with a superstructure The central shrine faces north one shrine faces west and the other face east The central shrine has a square superstructure Shikhara called Brahmachhanda girvashikhara The west and east facing shrines have superstructures called the Rudrachhanda grivashikhara and Vishnuchhanda grivashikhara respectively The design of the superstructures speaks of the artistic taste of the builders They are threedimensional with the first tier tala measuring a third of the total height of the tower and the second tier measuring one half the height of the first Each of the three shrines have individual vestibules or half hall or ardhamantapa which open to a large common open hall called the mahamantapa or navaranga whose ceiling is supported by four ornate central pillars At the entrance to the shrines bilpitha are the guardians to the eight directionsashtadikpalaka ashta  eight dik  directions palaka  keeper with their consorts and vehicles vahana

The entire complex is oriented towards the impressive Brahmadeva pillar and faces north The main central shrine houses the image of Adhinatha the first Jain tirthankara Teaching God The west right and east left facing shrines have the images of later day tirthankaras Shantinatha and Neminatha respectively The images appear to be of wellpolished steatite material and could be later day replacements According to Robert J Del Bonto who conducted research at the site the two shrines that form the later day additions are a twin construction are lateral face each other have individual vestibule and a closed mantapa hall and open into a common open pillared porch open mantapa The art critic MH Dhaky calls them as Shantinatha Basadi and regards them a good example of the terminal stage in Western Ganga art The temple exhibits fine sculptures of Jain Yakshas male benevolent spirits and Yakshis their female counterparts of the Western Ganga and Hoysala periods

According to the art critic and historian S Settar generally Brahmadeva pillars found in front of ancient Jain temples do not house sculptures of the Brahma Yaksha or the god Brahma rather they find their origins in the Manasthambha sthambha lit pillar and have images of the Sarvanubhuti Yaksha The base of this pillar is square and exhibits looped garland decorations and at the top supports a two handed seated image of east facing Siddhayika The overall composition of the temple according to Sarma is one of clarity in structure and function without any emphasis on over decoration

After receiving his doctorate he worked at the Berlin Charit and subsequently became an assistant in the department for the mentally ill under Wilhelm Griesinger 18171868 and Karl Wilhelm Ideler 17951860 In 1869 he became an associate professor of psychiatry as well as a clinical instructor in the department for mental and nervous diseases In 1874 he attained the title of full professor of psychiatry

Westphals contributions to medical science are many in 1871 he coined the term agoraphobia when he observed that three male patients of his displayed extreme anxiety and feelings of dread when they had to enter certain public areas of the city He is credited with providing an early diagnosis of pseudosclerosis a disease known today as hepatolenticular degeneration He also demonstrated a relationship between tabes dorsalis nerve degeneration in the spinal cord and paralysis in the mentally insane

Westphal is credited with describing a deep tendon reflex anomaly in tabes dorsalis that later became known as the ErbWestphal symptom named with neurologist Wilhelm Heinrich Erb 18401921 His name is also shared with neurologist Ludwig Edinger 18551918 regarding the EdingerWestphal nucleus which is an accessory nucleus of the oculomotor nerve cranial nerve number III CN III He was the first physician to provide a clinical description of narcolepsy and cataplexy 1877 French physician JeanBaptistedouard Glineau 18281906 also described the two maladies coining the term narcolepsie in 1880

A large portion of his written work dealt with diseases of the spinal cord and neuropathological issues He trained a number of prominent neurologists and neuropathologists including Arnold Pick Hermann Oppenheim Karl Frstner Carl Moeli and Karl Wernicke His son Alexander Karl Otto Westphal 18631941 was also a psychiatrist and is associated with the WestphalPiltz syndrome neurotonic pupillary reaction Westphal in addition to his multiple contributions to neurology and neuroanatomy has been credited with introducing rational and noncensorious treatment to psychiatric hospitalization in Germany

Michel Foucault credits Westphal for the birth of the modern homosexual with his paper published in 1870 on contrary sexual feeling in which he describes two people dealing with what would later come to be known as homosexuality This appears to be one of the first medical accounts of sexuality as a psychiatric disorder

El Brujo
Located in the Chicama Valley the El Brujo Archaeological Complex just north of Trujillo La Libertad Province Peru is an ancient archaeological site that was occupied from preceramic times Considering the broad cultural sequencing the Chicama Valley can be considered as an archaeological microcosm The research benefits from the favourable environmental and topological conditions for material conservation

Huaca Prieta is the earliest part of the complex but he biggest constructions on the site belong to the Moche culture In this area there are also the remains of the later Lambayeque and Chim

The development of the Brujo Archaeological Complex during the Intermediate Period falls within a context of early complex societies construction During the Moche era monumental religious and sociopolitical centers usually named huacas were built Although the architecture the iconography and the practice of sacrifice relate the Brujo Complex to a ceremonial ritual and funerary site the constructions are considered as the result of labor the caciques controlled The huacas of the Early Intermediate Period 200 BC 600 AD seem to have exerted a polymorphous and centrifugal power yet the complex is located in a difficult weather condition area 

The Brujo Complex is represented by three major huacas The Huaca Prieta mound dates back to the preceramic times Huaca Cortada and Huaca Cao Viejo the largest are stepped truncated pyramids constructed at the northern corners of the terrace during the EIP Building archaeology unveils seven phases of construction spanning the early and middle phases of Moche era 

Huaca Cao Viejo is famous for its polychrome reliefs and mural paintings and the discovery of the Seora de Cao whose remains are currently the earliest evidence for a female ruler in Peru Both appeared in National Geographic magazine in July 2004 and June 2006 The site officially opened to the public in May 2006 and a museum exhibition was proposed for 2007

The abandonment of the Huacas at the end of the Early Intermediate Period could have been linked to the political instability and upheavals of the Southern sphere of the Moche Some archaeologists also point out the extreme climatic events at the end of the Intermediate Period that could have led to the decline of the culture However the informations relating to the end of the period are limited The Lambayeque Culture arose in the Chicama Valley around 900 AD before being successively incorporated in the Chimu and the Inca expansive empires Nevertheless The Brujo Archaeological Complex remained a ceremonial and funerary area dedicated to the collective memory 

A 17thcentury letter found during excavations at the site may contain translations of numbers written in Quingnam or Pescadora using the decimal system the first physical evidence for the existence of these languages if they are not different names for the same language Archaeologists believe that the language was influenced by Quechua an ancient tongue still spoken by millions of people across the Andes

The Pinhoe Egg
The Pinhoe Egg is a childrens fantasy novel by British author Diana Wynne Jones published by HarperCollins Childrens Books in 2006 It was the last published of the seven 1977 to 2006

It revisits Chrestomanci Castle and the character of Cat Chant from her first Chrestomanci book but also introduces the character of Marianne Pinhoe who lives in the village near the castle and whose family practices a rather different sort of magic from any that Chrestomanci or his charges have encountered

The Chrestomanci books are collectively named for a powerful enchanter and British government official in a world parallel to ours who supervises the use of magic or the Chrestomanci an office that requires a powerful enchanter and is responsible for supervising The Pinhoe Egg is set in our time during the tenure of Christopher Chant who is Chrestomanci in five of the seven books and is often called Chrestomanci as a personal name

Marianne Pinhoes family tries to keep their magic a secret They dont want the Big Man or Chrestomanci interfering as he tends to do when people misuse magic And the Pinhoes certainly are guilty of that Gammer the head of the Pinhoe clan has ostensibly gone mad but Marianne doesnt believe that shes completely round the twist Shes sure that Gammers the one sending plagues to the Farleighs a related clan that also wishes to stay out of the sights of the Big Man Until recently the Farleighs and the Pinhoes had been working together but it seems that Gammer has started a war and itll be hard to keep their operations under wraps for long

Meanwhile up at the Castle Cat acquires a horse He also meets the man who was bootboy at the Castle when the current Chrestomanci was a lad Jason and helps him and his new wife choose a house They finally settle on Woods House Gammers old place and Marianne while showing Cat around gives him an old egg from the attic an egg with strong Dont Notice spells placed on it An egg that is sure to arouse the interest of the Big Man up at the castle  something the rest of the Pinhoe clan and Gammer in particular doesnt want at all

Marianne Pinhoe Marianne is the main protagonist of the book She is set to be the next Gammer of the Pinhoe clan but that isnt what she wants at all She has very strong magic but like many of Jones characters doesnt know it She is an enchantress although her mother trains her up to be a witch She seems to have a lot of dwimmer which is a sort of magic

Joe Pinhoe Mariannes brother is sent to work as a bootboy and spy up at Chrestomanci Castle He isnt really interested in the work however and mostly idles about He is a disappointment to the family but hed fixed it that way on purpose He likes to fix up contraptions using magic and machinery and he and Roger try to turn it into a lucrative business scheme

Eric Cat Chant In the first Chrestomanci book Cat is a very lonely character clinging to his older sister and later to Janet and distrusting the adults of the Castle In this book we see that he has not only grown to like and trust the people of the Castle but he forms many new friendships both with characters older than himself Jason the former bootboy and his wife Irene and characters of his own age Marianne He acquires a horse Syracuse whom he has an intimate friendship with and a griffin Klartch although Klartch had been a mistake hatched from an egg Marianne had given him

Roger Chant Roger is the son of Chrestomanci Christopher Chant and Millie the Living Asheth from The Lives of Christopher Chant He like his sister is quite fat Instead of wishing for a horse he acquired a bicycle He makes quite good friends with Joe Pinhoe and together create a flying machine which they work on in secret

Julia Chant Julia is the daughter of Chrestomanci and Millie She caught the horse fever from Janet and tried to ride Syracuse but found she couldnt deal with his temperament so he became Cats horse She used to have a crush on Jason and is upset that when she learns that he is married

Janet Chant Janet is the other world equivalent of Cats sister Gwendolen She used to live in the normal world suspected to be our world and got to Cats world by the works of Gwendolen Although she can get fiery sometimes she is usually kind and sympathetic Janet discovers she is one of those people afraid of horses She like Julia had been infatuated with Jason but was much more devastated than Julia when he showed up married seeing as she had been planning to marry him in the future

Irene Irene is the woman who married Jason She is described as having an Egyptian profile with dark hair She by her faithful gardener and Marianne is called Princess Irene She is the kind of woman that most people end up liking even Janet and Julia She is a Pinhoe and ends up buying Gammers old house It is strongly implied that she will become the next Gammer seeing as she has a lot of dwimmer

Chrestomanci Also known as Christopher Chant Referred to as The Big Man by the Pinhoes Chrestomanci is the title of the post held by a ninelived enchanter who keeps order in the magical realms Father of Roger and Julia Chant and guardian of Janet Chant Cat is apprenticed to him to become the next Chrestomanci

Millie Chrestomancis wife a kind loving woman and a powerful enchantress

Landsmanshaft
A landsmanshaft also landsmanschaft plural landsmanshaftn is a mutual aid society benefit society or hometown society of Jewish immigrants from the same European town or region

The Landsmanshaft organizations aided immigrants transitions from Europe to America by providing social structure and support to those who arrived in the United States without the family networks and practical skills that had sustained them in Europe Toward the end of the 19th and in the beginning of the 20th centuries they provided immigrants help in learning English finding a place to live and work locating family and friends and an introduction to participating in a democracy through their own meetings and procedures such as voting on officers holding debates on community issues and paying dues to support the society Through the first half of the 20th century meetings were often conducted and minutes recorded in Yiddish which was the language that all members could understand As Jewish immigration declined most landsmanshaft functions faded into the background but the organizations nevertheless continued as a way of maintaining ties to life in Europe as well as providing a form of life insurance disability and unemployment insurance and subsidized burial

Members paid dues on a regular basis and if they lost their jobs became too sick to work or died the society paid the member or their family a benefit to keep them afloat during that time When the funds were not needed to support members landsmanshaftn frequently invested the money in funds that supported the Jewish community in others ways such as Israel Bonds Most landsmanshaftn were based in New York City where the majority of Jews settled and conditions were conducive to sustaining these types of organizations though they sometimes relocated as the membership migrated to the suburbs

There were different types of landsmanshaftn including Jewish burial societies known as chevra kadisha societies associated with a particular synagogue or social movement and ladies auxiliary societies for women Landsmanshaftn frequently admitted only men as members with the understanding that their wives and children were covered by their membership and received equivalent benefits or had a ladies auxiliary group for women The Workmens CircleArbeter Ring is a mutual aid society with more than 200 branches but because it is not based on geography or members hometowns is not strictly a landsmanshaft even though it largely functions as one

In 1938 a federal Works Progress Administration project identified 2468 landsmanshaftn in New York City where the overwhelming number in the United States were located The number of landsmanshaftn began to decline in the 1950s and 1960s as their members died and were not replaced by the next generation of their members children The vast majority became defunct though some societies continue to meet regularly into the 21st century and operate scores of burial plots in cemeteries in the New York metropolitan area

Over time landsmanshaftn lost members as they aged and died and many became defunct The next generation felt less need of a connection to Europe relied on the national programs of the New Deal if they needed financial support during difficult times and because they were not immigrants didnt need landsmanshaftn to socialize or meet others When officers were not replaced it sometimes resulted in difficulties for the relatives of members who died because the officers were required to issue burial permits to the cemeteries in which their plots were located The state of New York particularly the Department of Insurance stepped in to take over these functions for some groups Many records of defunct landsmanshaftn eventually made their way from the New York State Department of Insurance to the archives of YIVO

Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz
Friedrich Wilhelm Graf von Haugwitz   11 December 1702 Saxony  30 August 1765 Deutsch Knnitz  Habsburg Moravia was Supreme Chancellor of the United Court Chancery and the head of Directorium in publicis et cameralibus under Maria Theresa of Austria He also served as one of the key advisors in instituting Maria Theresas reforms Haugwitz attempted to bring both centralization and economic reform to the Habsburg lands

In this position Haugwitz presided over the hereditary lands of the Habsburg Monarchy After 1760 the chancery also dealt in the affairs of Bohemia The Directorium in publicis et cameralibus became a centralized agency established with the advisement of Haugwitz to deal with matters such as international administration and taxation public safety social welfare education church matters mining and commerce It is clear from Maria Theresas testament that Haugwitz was one of her most valued advisors
He was truly sent to me by Providence for to break the deadlock I needed such a man honorable disinterested without predispositions and with neither ambition nor hangerson who supported what was good because he saw it to be good

Haugwitz father was a general in the service of Saxony As a young man Haugwitz went to Rome and then entered the civil service in Silesia This job came to an end when Frederick II invaded Silesia and Haugwitz escaped to Vienna Maria Theresa sent him to the remaining part of Silesia under her rule to get the finances in order Haugwitz as a student of the Austrian cameralist Wilhelm von Schrder learned hostility towards the wealthy estates Haugwitz was also an admirer of the reforms and new administration in the Prussian province of Silesia He intended to change economic and administrative institutions through compartmentalization of government functions education centralization of the economy and provision of economic information to the monarchy

In terms of compartmentalization Haugwitz instituted a separation of judicial matters from political and fiscal matters by instituting a new High Court Oberste Justizstelle Regional courts functioned directly beneath the Empress with each departmental chief supervising his own affairs

Haugwitz also focused on another important initiative to bring modern economic thought to students Maria Theresa had established the Theresianum to train noble children for civil service Through this institution Haugwitz planned to bring about economic modernization To catalyze this modernization and establish Vienna as a place of economic discourse Haugwitz brought Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi to Vienna first to teach German as the language of administration and later to train students according to both German Kameralism and modern economic theories and practices As both a former soldier in Prussia and a Protestant Justi was not well liked in Vienna Because of this mistrust Justi lacked the access to pertinent economic data required to execute his theories Society was also not prepared for modern economic thought because of the traditionally Jesuit nature of scholarship and the division of the Habsburg economy into various regional and local economies

In 1746 under the direction of Haugwitz in an attempt to bring about economic centralization the Directorium was established as a central agency to supervise the lands in the monarchy and make recommendations about economic improvements In 1749 the government established Representationen und Cammern as local offices of the Directorium chiefly as mechanisms for supervising tax policy

Because of this economic centralization Haugwitz provided Emperor Joseph II with an unprecedented amount of information about the economies of the states over which he would reign As part of Joseph IIs education he received an extensive overview of the economic makeup of each state Such a report was unprecedented because it would traditionally have been viewed as an intrusion in the affairs normally reserved to the estates All of these reforms helped to bring about the eventual peak of mercantilism in the 1760s

Military reforms complimented Haugwitzs economic initiatives Due to his belief in the need for immediate supremacy of the sovereign over the army and the maintenance of an adequate body of troops even in time of peace Haugwitz contributed to military reform in both funding and the development of a standing army

To protect the monarchy Haugwitz recommended a standing army of 108000 supported by contributions by the estates of 14 million gulden To avoid the previous issues in estates withholding of contributions or the tedious process of frequent appeals to the estates Haugwitz instituted the Ten Years Recess Under this program despite the resistance of the estates the estates would guarantee payment for ten years This period abolished the previous fluctuations in finances Previously when taxes were levied from the estates the estates disagreed amongst themselves over the amount levied divided the sum among the various estates collected taxes from the peasantry deducted from these taxes and then distributed the remainder to the monarchy In this reform Representationen und Cammern collected the taxes in order that the greatest portion of the levy would be distributed to the monarchy

In addition to these military finance reforms Haugwitz instituted reforms within the military A policy quite close to conscription was established Uniform dress was required of soldiers in order to foster national spirit Haugwitz advocated the usage of Prussian fighting tactics A training school was founded to train officers in these tactics

Despite the largescale nature and depth of Haugwitzs reforms their efficacy was not as great as he had intended Haugwitzs attempt to transform the monarchy from a feudal aristocracy to a wellorganiseddespotism was incomplete Franck p190 The superior court system that established local judges while initially an attempt at both centralization and organization brought about the opposite due to the tremendous autonomy of each departmental chief Furthermore the reforms had limited scope because they were not aimed at nor did they have any effect on Hungary Transylvania Austria the Netherlands or Lombardy

The beginning of the Seven Years War in 1757 thwarted the development of many of the reforms In false defense of his failing policies Haugwitz argued that the reforms were only for peacetime Eventually Haugwitzs Directorium was stripped of its military and financial functions and renamed the Bohemian and Austrian Court Chancellery Most power now became centered in the Council of State headed by Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz Kaunitz a historic foe of Haugwitz replaced him in instituting policies However Haugwitzs policies would have an effect throughout the reign of Maria Theresa and later in the reign of Joseph II

Early in his career the composer Joseph Haydn was briefly in Count Haugwitzs employ playing the organ in the Bohemian Chancellery chapel at the Judenplatz

In the summer of 1765 he moved to one of his castles in Miroslavsk Knnice where due to dysentery his health worsened He died on 30 August 1765 His body was taken to Nm nad Oslavou where he was buried on 1 September 1765 in the crypt of the Church of St John the Baptist Later his remains along with those of his wife were moved on 19 February 1768 to a crypt in the Capuchin church near the castle in Nm

You Never Know Who Your Friends Are is the second solo album by American multiinstrumentalist Al Kooper issued in 1969 on Columbia Records

Kooper wasted no time recording this album coming just seven months after his debut release It is a continuation of sorts of his debut the album contains another eclectic mix of rock rhythm and blues jazz pop and blues though without the psychedelics that had somewhat permeated through I Stand Alone Utilizing a large group of musicians under the direction of Charlie Calello known collectively as The Al Kooper Big Band Kooper also strayed away from the heavy string orchestrations of his debut

Relying on more original compositions with nine of twelve tracks by Kooper and the remaining three by Harry Nilsson and Motown Records staff songwriters the album further helped to cement Koopers reputation The album reached 125 on the Billboard 200 on October 25 1969 and was on the charts for six weeks

Extended sympathy
Extended sympathy in welfare economics refers to interpersonal value judgments of the form that social state x for person A is ranked better than worse than or as good as social state y for person B Arrow 1963 pp 11415 For example it would perhaps be preferable to lower a wealthy persons income in order to increase a poorer persons income by the same amount Here any characteristics that define each person skills aptitudes etc are distinguished from the rest of the social state and put on a par with conventional measures of wealth insofar as they affect an extended sympathy judgment

In his seminal work on social choice theory Kenneth Arrow 1963 mentions the ancient lineage of extended sympathy in ethical writings and its basic if informal character in many welfare judgments Arrows book itself p9 uses individual preference orderings rather than realvalued measures of preferences This excludes interpersonal comparisons of welfare in a precise sense invariance of social choices to linear cardinalizations of individual preference orderings Extendedsympathy interpersonal comparisons of welfare relax that constraint Arrow 1983 pp 1512 Such comparisons expand the informational base of welfaretheoretical decisions as Amartya Sen 1982 has emphasized Still variants of Arrows dictatorial result persist in reformulation Suzumura 1997 p221

She was commissioned 11 May 1996 and decommissioned 1 December 2007 Stricken from the Navy list 1 December 2007 sold by US General Services Administration for scrap 8 May 2014

Black Hawk was of the MHC 51 class of ships which are the worlds largest glass reinforced plastic GRP ships and the first US Navy ships designed solely for mine hunting the technique of locating mines with sonar and neutralizing them with a remotely controlled underwater vehicle or divers

The ships mission was to clear harbor coastal and ocean waters of acoustic magnetic and pressurecontact type mines utilizing reconnaissance classification and neutralization tactics Exceptionally low magnetic and acoustic signatures protect the ship against detonations during mine hunting operations

Black Hawk MHC58 was the eighth ship in the US MHC 51 Osprey Class Coastal Minehunter Program and the third US Navy ship to bear that name Black Hawks keel was laid on September 3 1992 and her christening and launching was on August 27 1994 at Intermarine USA Corporation Savannah Georgia

USS Black Hawk MHC58 was commissioned in ceremonies held on May 11 1996 at Pier Two at the Naval Education Training Center Newport RI

The ships shield is dark blue and gold which are the colors traditionally used by the Navy to reflect the sea and excellence Black is indicative of strength and stability Blue denotes loyalty and devotion White is emblematic of integrity and is symbolic of sea foam and breakers The two mines recall the two previous ships of the same name and underscore the Black Hawks mine hunting capabilities The stylized paddlewheel is reminiscent of the first Black Hawk a sidewheel steamer which served as flagship for Rear Admiral DD Porter and SP Lee successive commander of the Mississippi Squadron The paddle wheel further simulates a maritime compass suggesting leadership guidance and alludes to navigation and the far reaching scope and mission of the past and present USS Black Hawk The annulets incorporated into the paddle wheel suggest continual efforts The paddle wheel together with the two mines symbolize the three ships bearing the name Black Hawk

On the ships crest the waves of the sea denote the coastal waters harbors waterways and Navy theater of operations The stylized black hawk reflects the continuous aggressiveness of the Black Hawk and its crew in carrying out their mission of minehunting fueling repairing and keeping combatant vessels in fighting trim The name Black Hawk was derived from Indian Chief Black Hawk mentioned in history as the leader of the Sac  Fox tribes during the Black Hawk War The star on the hawks wing is commemorative of the battle star received by the second Black Hawk for her service in World War II

Two previous US Navy ships have borne the name Black Hawk The first Black Hawk was a sidewheeler river steamer that served as flagship of the Mississippi Squadron from December 1862 through May 1864 On 22 April 1865 she burned and sank Her wreck was raised and sold in April 1867

The second Black Hawk was commissioned 16 May 1918 and assigned as tender and flagship to the Mine Force in Inverness Scotland from June 1918 until the end of World War I when her base was shifted to the North Sea She was designated a destroyer tender in November 1920 and she tended destroyer squadrons until 1942 She was decommissioned 15 August 1946 Black Hawk received one battle star for her service in World War II

Levis Stadium
Levis Stadium is an American football stadium located in Santa Clara California in the Bay Area It has served as the home venue for the National Football League NFLs San Francisco 49ers since 2014 The stadium is located approximately south of San Francisco and is named for Levi Strauss  Co which purchased naming rights in 2013

In 2006 the 49ers proposed constructing a new stadium at Candlestick Point in San Francisco the site of their existing home Candlestick Park The project which included plans for retail space and housing improvements was claimed to be of great potential benefit to the nearby historically blighted neighborhood of Hunters Point After negotiations with the city of San Francisco fell through the 49ers focused their attention on a site adjacent to their administrative offices and training facility in Santa Clara

In June 2010 Santa Clara voters approved a measure authorizing the creation of the taxexempt Santa Clara Stadium Authority to build and own the new football stadium and for the city to lease land to the authority A construction loan raised from private investors was secured in December 2011 allowing construction to start in April 2012 Levis Stadium opened on July 17 2014

Levis Stadium has been the site of the Pac12 Football Championship Game since 2014 Previously that game was played on the home field of the division winner possessing the better record Levis Stadium hosted Super Bowl 50 on February 7 2016 It also hosted Alabama and Clemson for the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship

The stadium was designed by HNTB an internationally renowned architectural firm with a focus on creating a multipurpose venue and with the fan experience and green technology as top priorities Civil engineering work was performed by Winzler  Kelly which was acquired by GHD Group in 2011 Commissioning services were provided by Glumac

Levis Stadium is designed as an open stadium with a natural grass field It has a seating capacity of 68500 expandable to approximately 75000 to host major events like the Super Bowl and the FIFA World Cup However on June 27 2015 The Grateful Dead Fare Thee Well Tour made history by extending the stadium to 83000 in attendance The seating design of the stadium places approximately twothirds of the fans in the lower bowl which is one of the largest of its kind in the entire NFL The design features significantly improved accessibility and seating options for fans with special needs and disabilities when compared to Candlestick Park The configuration is similar to Ford Field home of the NFLs Detroit Lions with the majority of the luxury suites on one side of the field which puts the fans in the upper deck closer to the action

As a multiuse facility the stadium can be configured for special touring events including concerts motocross events indooroutdoor conferences and other community events The stadium is also designed to meet the FIFA field geometry requirements for international soccer which will allow it to host international friendly matches and major tournaments such as the FIFA World Cup The stadium will also feature over of flexible premium meeting space in the club areas
The stadium has created an in stadium app designed specifically for home football games for the 49ers to provide a better fan experience for fans and guests The app can be downloaded for free off of the App Store and Google Play Features are limited on nonfootball game days or if one is outside the vicinity of the stadium However when having the app within the stadium on game and event days one has many options including inseat delivery live streaming navigation and much more The app can be extended to other events hosted by the stadium if the third party would like to include its features for their guests

The stadium has had repeated problems with the grass surface including the grass collapsing under Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker during a week 6 game in 2015 This has led to concern that the stadium wasnt of a high enough caliber to host a high stakes game such as the Super Bowl The problems with the turf were mentioned the day after the Super Bowl by Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib who said The footing on the field was terrible San Fran the 49ers has to play eight games on that field so they better do something to get it fixed It was terrible

Stadium proponents and those who expect to profit from the construction of the stadium claim that the stadium is currently one of the largest buildings registered with the US Green Building Council It is also believed to be the first stadium that will have both a green roof and solar panels The 49ers are exploring collaborative opportunities with the Environmental Protection Agency to explore environmentally friendly components including


Levis Stadium received a Gold LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Certificate It is the first professional football stadium in the United States to receive this certification as new construction

Stadium patrons have the option of riding VTA Light Rail Valley Transportation Authority to the stadium The closest light rail station is the Great America station which is located just west of the stadium in the median of Tasman Drive

To the east other transit options include the VTA Lick Mill station also in the Tasman median as well as the Amtrak and ACE station near Californias Great America

Levis Stadium was constructed immediately east of the San Tomas Aquino Trail a paved multiuse path installed by the City of Santa Clara in 2004 that connects to a continuous 100mile network of offstreet paths including the regional San Francisco Bay Trail The city announced in March 2013 that the San Tomas Aquino Trail would be temporarily detoured between Agnew Road and Tasman Drive for approximately 1 year starting April 15 and ending when the Stadium is open but this onemile section of the trail remained closed to the public before and during stadium events since they began in August 2014 requiring the continued use of the twomile onstreet detour

The stadium projects Final Environmental Impact Report EIR disclosed no such ongoing temporary closures of the trail but stated instead that While there will likely be a sizeable increase in pedestrians on the San Tomas Aquino Creek trail before and after NFL events the creek trail is open to both pedestrians and cyclists and there are no restrictions on use Anyone at anytime can access and use the trail

The stadiums official mailing address is on Marie P DeBartolo Way formerly Centennial Boulevard which is actually a culdesac on the east side of the stadium The primary access route to the stadium is Tasman Drive which runs along its northern side Tasman is a major eastwest arterial road which connects to Interstate 880 several miles to the east Both west and east of the stadium Tasman intersects with various northsouth arterial roads which connect to several important freeways such as US Route 101 California State Route 237 and Interstate 280 The closest and most important of those northsouth roads is Great America Parkway to the west of the stadium which is named after the theme park to the south

On May 8 2013 the 49ers announced that San Franciscobased Levi Strauss  Co purchased the naming rights to the new stadium The deal calls for Levis to pay 2203 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around 75 million On September 14 2015 ESPNs Chris Berman coined the name The Big Bellbottom in reference to the stadium In a Deadspin article covering the 49ers on August 18 2015 article writer Drew Magary coined the nickname the Jeanhole for the stadium

Levis Stadium has been praised for its excellent sightlines beautiful architecture plentiful amenities technological advancements convenient public transportation access and environmental sustenance However the stadium has been heavily criticized for its highly corporate atmosphere and lack of a football atmosphere that Candlestick Park had With the stadium having the most expensive ticket prices in the league during its inaugural season many longtenured and loyal fans that had contributed to the football atmosphere at Candlestick Park could not afford to buy season tickets with the added cost of the Stadium Builders License Also with the several distractions inside the stadium that include multiple bars and lounges fans would often hang out in those places while the game is going on rather than watching the game from their seats

Levis Stadium has received some backlash from season ticket holders who are unhappy regarding rules that wont allow them to print their tickets until 72 hours before the game making resale very difficult In addition older 49ers fans say that people are more segmented at Levis Stadium in comparison to Candlestick Park leaving tailgaters with large expanses of empty parking stalls and a more desolate tailgating experience 
Levis Stadium has also received heavy criticism for the way fans are treated on hot days during earlyseason afternoon games The majority of fans are seated on the east side of the stadium and during these afternoon games they are exposed to the sun as there is no shade provided due to the lack of overhangs With the climate of Santa Clara being much warmer than San Francisco it makes watching games on hot days uncomfortable for fans as they are less accommodated for exposure to the sun than are patrons at other stadiums in hotweather climates Several fans suffered heat exhaustion during preseason and early season afternoon games This has led to the eastern stands being largely empty on hot days This was the result of the stadium being designed with the Candlestick Point site in mind and when the team decided to build it in Santa Clara instead they kept the design intact in order to quickly get started on construction not taking the differences in climate into account Due regulations by the Federal Aviation Administration for being in close proximity to the airport they cannot add any more height to the stadium while any additional overhangs would have to be structures making it very difficult to fix the problem 

Pilots flying into San Jose International Airport have frequently complained of being blinded or disoriented by the lights from the light towers and scoreboards The stadium is directly in the flight path of one of the airports runways According to Bay Area NBC affiliate KNTV there have been at least 43 complaints about the lights since the stadium opened In response Santa Clara mayor Lisa Gillmor promised to work with the 49ers and the Stadium Authority to determine if the lights need to be recalibrated

The San Francisco 49ers played at Candlestick Park from 1971 to 2013 The stadium was a sentimental fan favorite and housed all 5 Super Bowl Championship teams It was however the oldest unrenovated stadium in the NFL and was beginning to show its age

The 49ers pursued a new stadium since 1997 when a plan for a stadium and a mall at Candlestick Point passed a public vote When the plans failed to move forward the San Francisco 49ers presented an alternative plan on July 18 2006 to construct a new 68500seat open air stadium as part of a mixed use development featuring housing commercial and retail space In November 2006 the team announced that plans for a new stadium at Candlestick Point were not feasible citing extensive costs for infrastructure parking accommodations and other changes that would cost more than the stadium itself The 49ers turned their focus to making Santa Clara the home to their new stadium

San Francisco voters in 1997 approved 100 million in city spending to build a new stadium and an attached shopping mall at Candlestick Point However even after voter approval to grant economic help for the project the stadium was not constructed This was because owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr was facing legal troubles which led him to surrender ownership of the team to his sister Denise DeBartolo York and brotherinlaw John York Mills Corporation the company chosen by the 49ers was unable to put together a plan to successfully construct a new stadium for the team NFL owners had gone as far as awarding the new stadium the rights to host Super Bowl XXXVII When stadium plans stalled the game went to San Diegos Qualcomm Stadium instead

For years the city and team ownership were embattled over attempts to gain funding and a greenlight for construction of a new stadium None of these attempts proved to be successful 

The city of San Francisco received a new incentive to get a new stadium built Mayor Gavin Newsom wanted to bring the 2016 Summer Olympics to the city and a new stadium would sweeten the citys proposal for selection by the United States Olympic Committee as the official US submission to the IOC The announcement came in November 2006 It called for a new stadium that would be converted into a 68600seat stadium for the 49ers after the Olympics The Olympic Village would be converted into lowincome housing after the games were over

The new stadium was to be built at Candlestick Point on land just southeast of Candlestick Park The cost of the stadium would be 916 million Lennar Corporation would build housing retail and office space around the stadium area Originally part of the area surrounding Candlestick Park was to be zoned for retail space and housing the new 49ers stadium was to be combined with such elements bringing muchneeded attractions to the historically blighted neighborhood of Hunters Point

The stadium would be stocked with 150 luxury suites 7500 premium club seats and an increased number of seats lower and closer to the field called bowl seating potentially raising the 49ers franchise value up as much as 250 million and offering at least 300 million in advertising and concession deals the majority of which from paid corporate naming The architectural design would be reminiscent of San Francisco buildings

The project planning did not get off to a good start however with contention between the 49ers and the city of San Francisco over viable locations for the new stadium Initially the idea was to build a stadium in the parking lot of Candlestick Park and later demolish the aging stadium Team ownership feared that construction of the village and the stadium would severely limit the amount of land available in Candlestick Point creating a parking problem for fans and increasing traffic along the roads that link the stadium to the freeway Moreover with residents in the lowincome housing by 2016 traffic would be permanently increased further damaging the alreadylimited methods of transportation to the park

With San Francisco slow to come up with better locations for the stadium or ways to circumvent the problems posed by construction at Candlestick Point team owners Denise DeBartolo York and John York announced on November 9 2006 that the 49ers were shifting their efforts to create a new stadium to the city of Santa Clara home to the team offices and training facility since 1987 approximately south of San Francisco

The sudden removal of the planned stadium forced the San Francisco Olympics bid group to cancel its proposal which engendered great anger not only from Mayor Newsom but also from such 49ers legends as Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott who were part of the effort to bring the Olympics to the Bay Area In addition many fans were outraged at the suggestion to move the 49ers out of the city that it had shared history with for decades The Yorks insisted that the legacy of the franchise would be respected in the sense that the 49ers would not be renamed nor moved out of the Bay Area This was met with much opposition from Mayor Newsom and Senator Dianne Feinstein who was mayor of San Francisco between 1978 and 1988 the senator stated that the team should be unable to use the San Francisco name if its operations were not based in the city On January 3 2007 California State Senator Carole Migden introduced a bill entitled SB49 that would bar the 49ers from building a new stadium within a radius of San Francisco if they were to leave the city The 49ers organization announced its strong opposition to the legislation and retorted that passing such a bill would only encourage the team to move out of the Bay Area altogether The bill died without being acted upon

The Santa Clara stadium project had been in the works since 2007 with negotiations beginning in 2008 Two years later the following documents were produced that were key to understanding the stadium deal that went before the voters of Santa Clara on June 8 2010 All documents cited below are publicly available on the City of Santa Claras website


Most city council members in Santa Clara were extremely receptive to the possibility of a new stadium being constructed there for the 49ers In 2009 the Santa Clara City Council led by Mayor Patricia Mahan along with city employees began negotiating in earnest with the team who presented the city with stadium plans On June 2 2009 by a 52 vote the Santa Clara city council agreed to preliminary terms as detailed in a term sheet The official term sheet stated that the teams name would not change the team would continue to be called the San Francisco 49ers even when the move to Santa Clara was complete

In December 2009 Cedar Fair Entertainment Great Americas owner filed a lawsuit to stop the project from proceeding However the lawsuit was dismissed in court

On December 15 2009 the Santa Clara City Council voted 52 to withdraw their citysponsored ballot measure on the stadium issue in favor of a ballot initiative Measure J The ballot initiative was voted on on June 8 2010 and passed by 58 of Santa Clara voters Santa Clara City Council members William Kennedy and Jamie McLeod had opposed the stadium project and worked unsuccessfully to get Measure J defeated

Measure J is a binding voterinitiated measure that was approved by voters in the City of Santa Clara All documents cited below are publicly available on the City of Santa Claras official website


There was a possibility that the Oakland Raiders might share the stadium allowing its costs to be split between the two teams The stadium is designed to accommodate two teams with the exterior LEDs being programmable for alternate colors and two hometeam locker rooms The 49ers and Raiders publicly said it would be an option if possible while NFL commissioner Roger Goodell was strongly in favor of the two sharing a stadium Fans of both teams reacted negatively to the idea The arrangement would have been similar to the New York Giants and New York Jets who shared Giants Stadium from 1984 to 2009 and currently share its successor MetLife Stadium

The 49ers and Raiders sharing a stadium would not have been a first as the two shared Kezar Stadium for part of 1960 It would have also fulfilled the late Raiders owner Al Davis goal of a new stadium something he had strongly desired since the late 1980s although Davis was against sharing a new stadium with another NFL team in Los Angeles when the idea was proposed to him prompting his move back to Oakland in 1995 The Raiders as it stands play at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum and are the only NFL team still sharing its home field with a Major League Baseball team the Raiders lease on the Coliseum has been on yeartoyear extensions since the expiration of the last longterm lease in 2013

In the wake of Davis death the possibility of the 49ers and Raiders sharing the stadium became a stronger possibility However by October 2011 the 49ers were far enough along on the stadium to have reportedly already sold over a quarter of the luxury suites meaning the Raiders would be forced to be secondary tenants In October 2012 Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis told reporters he had no plans to share the Santa Clara stadium with the 49ers According to the report discussions remained open although Davis wanted to keep the team in Oakland or a nearby site in Dublin

When the stadium had its grand opening on July 17 2014 Goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the Raiders and that it was up for the team to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the Oakland Coliseum While the 49ers remained open to sharing the stadium with the Raiders the Raiders said that their personal preference was the Coliseum site

On February 20 2015 the Raiders announced that they would be seeking a joint stadium in Carson with the San Diego Chargers should they not receive public funding to replace the Oakland Coliseum reducing the likelihood of the Raiders sharing Levis Stadium with the 49ers In January 2016 after losing their bid to relocate to Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Rams the Raiders withdrew their request to move to Los Angeles and joint tenancy at Levis again surfaced in general discussion However in March 2017 the Raiders were approved for a move to Las Vegas for the 2020 season with the new Las Vegas Stadium under construction as their future home

Levis Stadium was mentioned as a possible temporary home for the Oakland Raiders for the 2019 season before they relocate to Las Vegas Santa Clara officials drew up plans for this possibility However the Raiders signed a oneyear lease extension for the Oakland Coliseum with an option for a second year of construction in Las Vegas is delayed ending any possibility of them playing at Levis Stadium

In December 2011 the Santa Clara City Council voted for an agreement that calls for the citys Stadium Authority to borrow 850 million from Goldman Sachs Bank of America and US Bank This will cover most of the construction costs with the remainder to be made up via funding from the NFL a hotel tax and city redevelopment funds Interest fees and terms for this loan have not been disclosed The 850 million building loan plus interest and fees will be assumed by the Citys Stadium Authority where additional interest and fees will be applied
On February 2 2012 NFL owners approved a loan to the 49ers of 200 million for use in constructing the new stadium and to be taken from a new G4 stadium loan fund Terms of the loan were not specified but under the previous G3 plan money was repaid directly into the leagues account from the borrowing teams share of gate receipts from road games

Construction began soon after funding for the stadium had been confirmed The official groundbreaking took place on April 19 2012 On July 30 2012 the first steel beams for the stadium were laid down The first seats in Levis Stadium were installed on October 1 2013

Construction was halted on June 11 2013 after a mechanic working on an elevator was struck by a counterweight and then fell down the shaft to his death Work resumed two days later after officials from the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration CalOSHA declared the site safe but as of October 2013 the accident remained under investigation

The Santa Clara stadium was constructed on a cityowned parking lot on Tasman Drive located adjacent to the north of Californias Great America theme park and leased to Great America for overflow parking As with Candlestick Park there are relatively few amenities in the stadiums immediate vicinity for sports fans besides the 49ers headquarters and training facility The Santa Clara Convention Center is northwest of the stadium site and there are two hotels on Tasman Drive next to the convention center but the closest significant concentration of hotels and restaurants is on the Mission College Boulevard corridor almost a mile to the south on the other side of Great America

The stadium opened on July 17 2014 It was originally scheduled to open on July 11 but was pushed back due to construction delays
The first game played at the new stadium was a Major League Soccer match on August 2 2014 where the San Jose Earthquakes defeated Seattle Sounders FC 10 before a crowd of 48765 The inaugural goal was scored in the 42nd minute by Yannick Djal

On August 17 2014 the 49ers lost their first preseason game 340 against the Denver Broncos at Levis Stadium One fan at the game collapsed due to the heat and had to be rushed to a local hospital where he died

The first 49ers regularseason game at the stadium was held during Week 2 on September 14 2014 when the team hosted the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football The Bears won the game 2820 in front of a 49ers home record attendance of 70799

In November 2013 stadium and 49ers officials initially requested the NFL to not schedule any Monday or Thursday night home games during Levis Stadiums inaugural season due to parking issues in the area surrounding the stadium during weekdays Two months later in January 2014 the Santa Clara city government was able to secure more than the 21000 necessary parking spots by approving use of the fairways at the cityowned Santa Clara Golf and Tennis Club which is located to the north of the stadium across Tasman Drive This arrangement is similar to and was modeled upon a longstanding arrangement between the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the adjacent Brookside Golf Course where the golf course was modified to allow for vehicular access to the fairways they are used for parking only when dry to minimize damage and any damage that does occur is repaired afterward

With access to the golf course fairways Levis Stadium now had 31600 potential parking spaces meaning that tailgating and weeknight games were now a possibility However the NFL decided not to schedule any weeknight home games at Levis Stadium in 2014 until traffic flow within the area is figured out with the exception of a Thanksgiving game between the 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks on November 27 2014 Parking prices which averaged 30 in the 49ers final season at Candlestick Park will increase to 40 at Levis Stadium

Anticipating significant traffic from Levis Stadium visitors the nearby city of Mountain View instituted a threehour parking limit on downtown streets during game days While residents received exemptions via permit tags stadiumgoers must park in paid lots or far from Mountain Views CaltrainVTA light rail station This station is the closest VTA light rail station to San Francisco and receives transferring passengers heading south to San Jose via light rail including people using the light rail to go directly to the Levis Stadium station

In Spring 2015 49ers officials offered the city of Santa Clara 15 million to take over the adjacent Santa Clara Youth Soccer Park and convert these soccer fields into additional parking lots This money along with a large percentage of parking fees would have then been used for the city to build a new youth sports complex elsewhere The plan was opposed by the youth soccer leagues that use the fields and critics calling it a land grab After many youth soccer players attended a city council meeting on April 29 to protest the proposal the 49ers withdrew the 15 million offer The team then gave the city an unsolicited offer of 3 million to help improve various youth athletic fields and facilities which was cited as a peace offering by San Francisco Chronicle columnists Phil Matier and Andrew Ross and other Bay Area media but the city council turned the offer down

Super Bowl 50 was held at the stadium on February 7 2016 The Denver Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers 2410 Lady Gaga performed the national anthem and Coldplay performed with Beyonc and Bruno Mars at halftime

Levis Stadium hosted WWEs WrestleMania 31 on March 29 2015 This was the first time WrestleMania was hosted in Northern California and the sixth WrestleMania to be held in California 
The area also hosted various activities in the weeklong celebration leading up to WrestleMania itself

The show set an attendance record for the stadium with 76976 It drew a 126 million gate

Levis Stadium hosted the 2015 NHL Stadium Series February 21 game between the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks The Kings defeated the Sharks 21 in front of a crowd of 70205

Soccer

On July 31 2014 the San Jose Earthquakes agreed to play one match per year for five years at Levis Stadium On September 6 2014 an international friendly between Mexico and Chile was held The stadium also hosted a 2015 International Champions Cup match between Barcelona and Manchester United on July 25 2015 when United won 31 A 2016 International Champions Cup match featured AC Milan and Liverpool on July 30 2016 with Liverpool winning 20

In June 2016 Levis Stadium hosted four games at the Copa Amrica Centenario the opening match between United States and Colombia two other group stage matches and a quarterfinal where Chile defeated Mexico 

A 2017 International Champions Cup game was held on July 23 2017 when Manchester United defeated Real Madrid 11 21 in a penalty shootout On March 23 2018 Mexico won 30 against Iceland in a friendly in both teams preparation for the 2018 FIFA World Cup

A 2018 International Champions Cup game was held on August 4 2018 when AC Milan defeated FC Barcelona 10 with a last second goal by Andr Silva

Levis Stadium has hosted numerous college football games The first college game played there was an October 2014 regular season game between the Oregon Ducks and the California Golden Bears in which Oregon won The stadium is the home of the Redbox Bowl formerly the Foster Farms Bowl and since 2014 has served as the host for the Pac12 Championship Game In January 2019 Levis Stadium hosted the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship marking the first time the College Football Playoff title game was played there

<doc id="7719976" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7719976" title="Lactobacillus brevis">
Lactobacillus brevis
Lactobacillus brevis is a grampositive rod shaped species of lactic acid bacteria which is heterofermentive creating CO2 and lactic acid during fermentation There are approximately 16 different species in L brevis group It can be found in many different environments such as fermented foods and as normal microbiota Lbrevis is found in food such as sauerkraut and pickles It is also one of the most common causes of beer spoilage Ingestion has been shown to improve human immune function and it has been patented several times Normal gut microbiota Lbrevis is found in human intestines vagina and feces

L brevis is one of the major Lactobacillus species found in tibicos grains used to make kefir and has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the polysaccharide dextran that forms the grains Major metabolites of L brevis include lactic acid and ethanol Strains of L brevis and L hilgardii have been found to produce the biogenic amines tyramine and phenylethylamine

EBFred WH Peterson and JA Anderson initially discovered the entire Lactobacillus species in 1921 and the species was categorized based on the ability to metabolize certain carbon and sugars This early study showed that this can produce acetic acid carbon dioxide and large amounts of mannitol Mannitol which is another carbon source that can be used to produce lactic acid

L brevis has been shown to actively transport glucose and galactose When fructose was used as a carbon source there was only some growth and L brevis was able to partially metabolize the fructose to mannitol Normal growth follows the lactic acid pathway that is commonly used by most lactic acid bacterium There are some strains that poorly metabolize glucose whereas other strain are able to easily metabolize the sugar As stated this is considered a lactic acid pathwayBy using the fermentation pathway the end result is lactic acid It appears that under high temperature conditions 50 degrees Celsius and in acidic environments the survival of this bacteria is longer than most bacteria under acidic conditions the bacteria can live about 45 minutes

Antibiotic resistance is acquired through conjugation a method of bacterial reproduction Conjugation permits a sharing of DNA allowing the bacterium to learn about various antibiotics through exposure and this information is passed down through replication between bacteria 
L brevis produces more organic acids specifically acetic acid and ethanol This means that this bacterium produces an increased acidic environment and alcohol Growth conditions all depend on the location of the bacterium within the intestines It does seem that they are unable to significantly replicate in anaerobic environments

Metabolic pathways are defined to mean the chemical process that occurs within an organism L brevis uses the glycolysis process to metabolize carbon sources by active transport which moves material against the concentration gradient normally this occurs is a movement from a high to low concentration This pathway is used in probiotics and food preservation 
L brevis is found in food such as sauerkraut and pickles It is also one of the most common causes of beer spoilage The hop which is an antimicrobial bitter flavoring agent in beer fails to suppress some strains of L brevis because they produce a transporter that pumps the active agents of hops out of the bacterial cell L brevis is one of the major Lactobacillus species found in tibicos grains aka water kefir grains and has been identified as the species responsible for the production of the polysaccharide dextran that forms the grains Major metabolites of L brevis include lactic acid and ethanol Strains of L brevis and L hilgardii have been found to produce the biogenic amines tyramine which is found by the fermentation metabolic pathway and is commonly found in spoiled or fermented foods and phenylethylamine which is found in chocolates but can also produce a fishy odor in other foods
As a bacterium there are some physical attributes that are common for all bacteria Grampositive bacteria consists of an external plasma membrane followed by periplasmic space and finally a peptidoglycan layer which faces the interior of the bacteria The external plasma membrane is very important for bacteria because this is how cells recognize the possible pathogenesis of the bacteria Peptidoglycan is also called murein and is made up of a series of sugars Within grampositive bacteria the peptidoglycan layer is much thicker than gramnegative bacteria The actual lattice that comprises peptidoglycan is referred to as the Slayer this lattice is linked to the peptidoglycan layer Unfortunately the Slayer is normally lost when processing the bacteria under laboratory conditions which can affect measuring adhesion When the Slayer is dissolved with high concentration levels of substances that break down hydrogen bonds the Slayers have a survival time of about 20 minutes with each generation Lbrevis contains approximately two promotors within this area meaning that there is significant transcription of the Slayer by high levels of transcribing of the sIpA gene SipA is a gene that has been found to aid in the coding for the production of murin peptidoglycan within the bacteria The purpose of transcription is to copy DNA into a mRNA which is used to create proteins The promoter is used during transcription to identify the appropriate location to begin transcribing Within probiotics it is actually the Slayer that attaches to the cellular wall of the gastrointestinal tract 
Ingestion of probiotics has been shown to improve human immune function and L brevis has been patented several times L brevis has been shown to survive in the gastrointestinal tract in humans and can therefore be used as a probiotic Currently the bacterium does not have the ability to convert milk to yogurt however they are appropriate to be used as an alternative to other probiotics in yogurts Within the geriatric population use of the bacteria in milk has been shown to increase cellular immunity Dietary probiotic supplementation enhances natural killer cell activity in the elderly an investigation of agerelated immunological changes L brevis is considered appropriate for probiotic use because there is significant growth at pHs 45 pH 5 is normally the appropriate range for milk and yogurts

There are significant vaginal bacteria that are found within the vagina and L brevis is included in this microbiome which is a collection of various bacteria The bacteria collaborate on protecting the vagina and vaginal maintenance Women of childbearing ages have a significant amount of Lbrevis and this is normally found in a healthy vagina For some illnesses or disruptions of the vagina this bacteria can be used in aiding to restore the microbiome Most of the Lactobacillus species of bacteria have been found useful in preventing urinary tract infections The efficiency in which a bacterium can defend the body is
1 Their symbiosis with potential pathogens
2 Their capability of producing antibacterial materials such as hydrogen peroxide to limit pathogen growth
3 Their production of biosurfactants that inhibit pathogen adherence
4 Their ability to prime macrophages leukocytes cytokines and other host defenses

During normal childbirth it appears that newborns after a period of days receive transmission of L brevis from the mother It appears that the transmission occurs through breast feeding or through natural child birth In infants this resistance is also helpful with protecting the gut against various bile and acids Helicobacter pylori which is a common gut pathogen in humans studies have shown that certain strains of Lbrevis are successful at combating this pathogen

Vaginosis is the most common form of bacterial infection this is commonly diagnosed as a yeast infection or trichomoniasis which is a sexually transmitted parasite commonly acquired during intercourse Lbrevis along with Lactobacillus jensenii has been shown to produce high levels of hydrogen peroxide which may be able remediate the bacterial vaginosis pathogenesisL Brevis is a commonly used ingredient in pharmaceutical materials used to treat vaginosis An evaluation of clue cells is one method of assessing vaginosis this assessment is performed by mounting clue cells and vaginal discharge onto a slide then adding sodium chloride followed by a microscopic assessment which involves bacteria identification

In addition to surviving within the gut of an organism LBrevis can also act to inhibit the pathogenic effects of certain gut pathogens and can also proliferate in the presence of additional bacteria Some strains are resistant to certain antibiotics specifically erythromycin and clindamycin This antibiotic resistance may be helpful in maintaining a healthy gut microbiome when taking prescribed antibiotics

BCPA Flight 304
BCPA Flight 30444 was a scheduled flight operated by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines from Sydney Australia to Vancouver Canada with scheduled stops at Fiji Canton Island Honolulu and San Francisco On 29 October 1953 the flight was conducted by a Douglas DC6 named Resolution and registered in Australia as VHBPE The propliner crashed during its initial approach towards San Francisco International Airport killing all 19 people on board including the American pianist William Kapell

The aircraft was flying the Honolulu  San Francisco leg with a crew of 8 and 11 passengers 10 adults and 1 child The estimated flying time was 9 hours and 25 minutes Captain Bruce N Dickson aged 34 and his crew took over the plane in Honolulu as scheduled

Dickson and his First Officer Frank A Campbell aged 28 each had several thousand hours of flight time in the DC6 Both pilots had made more than 100 approaches into San Francisco Airport many of which were instrument approaches On 29 October the weather in the San Francisco area did not present adverse flight conditions but visual reference with the ground was precluded by the overcast foggy conditions so an instrument approach was required

As the flight neared the California coast the crew contacted San Francisco Air Route Traffic Control ARTC At 807am Pacific Standard Time it was cleared to descend in accordance with Visual Flight Rules and to maintain at least on top of clouds which the crew acknowledged

At 815am the flight reported that it was starting descent and at that time was given the San Francisco weather report Just after 821am ARTC cleared the flight to the San Francisco instrument landing system ILS outer marker beacon via the Half Moon Bay fan marker direct to the San Francisco outer marker with instructions to maintain at least above all clouds and to contact San Francisco approach control after passing the Half Moon Bay fan marker

At 839am the crew called San Francisco approach control and advised that it was over Half Moon Bay on top of clouds Approximately three minutes later the crew reported southeast turning inbound At 845am a call to the flight was unanswered as were all subsequent calls

Local resident George Bordi heard the plane fly overhead in thick fog then moments later heard the tremendous crump sound of the plane impacting on nearby terrain

William Kapell a New York pianist who was returning from a concert tour in Australia was among the eleven passengers and eight crewmen losing their lives Kapell was the only United States citizen in the plane Most of the others were from Australia the United Kingdom along with one passenger from Canada

Many hours after the crash members of search parties who had difficulty getting through a dense wood at the base of Kings Mountain said they could find no survivors

Red Cross volunteers and emergency personnel including what would become the first forensic investigation team in the United States recovered bodies and wreckage used dental records to identify remains and put out three forest fires started by the crash The Redwood City Armory was used by the sheriffs department as a makeshift morgue Except for the body of William Kapell which was quickly transported by family members back to his home state of New York bodies were cremated at Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma California and returned to their families Two did remain in the cemetery passenger Williaam sic Cox in a standard plot while purser Knights ashes were placed in a niche in the columbarium at Cypress Lawn

The Civil Aeronautics Board investigated the accident The investigation began immediately after the wreckage was located in the mountainous area southwest of San Francisco about seven and a half miles southeast of the town of Half Moon Bay The aircraft was almost entirely destroyed by impact and ensuing fire It had initially struck the top of several large redwood trees shearing off one of its landing gear and leaving it hung in an oak It then continued across a narrow ravine and crashed against the side of a steeply rising slope approximately half a mile beyond the first tree strike The main wreckage area was at about above sea level

The landing gear was down and locked at the time of impact There was no evidence of mechanical or structural failure prior to the impact

The accident site was between the Half Moon Bay Fan Marker and the ILS Outer Marker and it appears the flight had not maintained at least on top of clouds between these points but had descended in weather conditions which precluded reference to the ground

In addition the flight had reported being over the Half Moon Bay Fan Marker at 839am and then Southeast turning inbound at about 842am In this time interval it would not have been possible for the flight at normal speed to have flown from the Half Moon Bay Outer Marker to the ILS Outer Marker make the required turn and return to the site of the crash in accordance with Civil Aeronautics Authority approved instrument approach procedure Thus it was likely that when the pilot reported he was Southeast turning inbound he was in fact southwest of the airport

The investigation then stated it was probable that the captain after reporting he was over Half Moon Bay either saw the terrain momentarily through an unreported break in the overcast foggy conditions or because of a radio navigational error became convinced his position was farther northeast and started to descend over what he believed was the proper area

It was therefore concluded that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of the crew to follow prescribed procedures for an instrument approach

Today the crash site is part of the El Corte de Madera Creek Open Space Preserve which includes the Resolution Trail named for the plane Park rules restrict visitors to the trail and visitors are also requested to respect this historical site by leaving any artifacts where they find them

Over fifty people attended a plaques dedication on June 27 2009 near the junction of the Fir  Vista Point trails near Vista Point  the site of where a military H19 Chickasaw recovery helicopter landed on the day of the crash

The latest remembrance day was the 65th anniversary of the crash held on October 29th 2018 Visiting the plaque that day was the brother of copilot Campbell Alan Campbell who had flown in from Cairns Australia He placed an Australian flag before the granite memorial and made a somber visit to the impact point

Beaubrun Ardouin
Alexis Beaubrun Ardouin 17961865 was a Haitian historian and politician He is best remembered for his elevenvolume Etudes sur lHistoire dHati Studies on the History of Haiti published in the 1850s and 60s His Etudes have served as a valuable resource for later historians Beaubrun Ardouin also wrote the first Haitian textbook Gographie de lIle dHati Geography of the Island of Haiti and Instruction sur le Jury

Ardouins historical writing attempted to put the Haitian Revolution in the context of other nationalist revolutions in the Americas He was a man of EuroAfrican ancestry from a family that was free before the revolution He has been criticized by 20thcentury scholars for championing free people of color as the leaders both of the revolution and of postindependence Haiti The historian Thomas Madiou who sought to repair the reputation of the great black heroes of the Haitian revolution especially Toussaint Louverture and to portray the revolution as a successful slave uprising instead of as a national independence movement is often cited as Ardouins intellectual opponent Historian and writer Hnock Trouillot describes the conflict between nineteenthcentury Haitian historians in more complex terms in his biography of Ardouin claiming that Ardouin lacked historical resources to assess the significance of Louverture Trouillot also describes Ardouins intense involvement in Haitian politics in the 1840s and his exile to Paris While in Paris Ardouin was responsible for editing and publishing Emeric Bergeauds novel Stella with Dentu in 1859 one year after Bergeauds death The novel is widely known as Haitis first and portrays the Haitian Revolution as a movement demonstrating the unity of Haitian citizens and the importance of the formation of Haiti as an antislavery state

Beaubrun Ardouin was elected Senator in 1832 and served on the Council of Secretaries of State in 1845

Growing up during the revolutionary period Beaubrun Ardouin was not able to attend school regularly he was selftaught He had a strong interest in French literature especially the works of Voltaire Montesquieu and JeanJacques Rousseau

Ardouins brothers Cligny and Coriolan were also wellknown Cligny as a politician and historian Coriolan as a poet The three Ardouin brothers along with the Nau brothers Emile and Ignace were members of the literary society The School of 1836 which was founded by Ignace Nau Coriolan died young in 1836 while Cligny ran afoul of Faustinlie Soulouques government and was executed in 1849 Beaubrun published Clignys Essais sur lHistoire dHati English Essays on the History of Haiti in 1865 just before his own death

AlMina
AlMina Arabic the port is the modern name given by Leonard Woolley to an ancient trading post on the Mediterranean coast of northern Syria in the estuary of the Orontes River near Samanda in Hatay Province of Turkey

The site was excavated in 1936 by Leonard Woolley who considered it to be an early Greek trading colony founded a little before 800 BC in direct competition with the Phoenicians to the south He argued that substantial amounts of Greek pottery at the site established its early Euboean connections while the Syrian and Phoenician cooking pottery reflected a cultural mix typical of an emporium Disappointed in not finding a Bronze Age port Woolley soon moved his interests to the earlier more urbane site of Alalakh

Woolleys critics point out that he discarded coarse undecorated utilitarian wares and that the relative numbers of Greek Syrian and Phoenician populations have not been established The controversy whether Al Mina is to be regarded as a native Syrian site with Syrian architecture and cooking pots and a Greek presence or as an Iron Age Greek trading post has not been resolved

AlMina has been largely overlooked in popular surveys Later work considered AlMina as key to understanding the role of early Greeks in the east at the outset of the Orientalizing period of Greek cultural history

Woolley identified AlMina with Herodotus Posideion but more recent scholarship places Posideion at Ras alBassit Robin Lane Fox has made a case for the Greek name of the site to have been the Potamoi Karon that is mentioned in Diodorus Siculus account of Ptolemy I Soters ravaging of the coastline in 312 BC he notes its unusual word order and suggestively links it to karu trading post in the inscription text of TiglathPileser IIIs conquests which would give Rivers of the Trading Posts Woolley on separate grounds dated the final extinction of the AlMina settlement to the late fourth century BC perhaps damaged during construction of the port of Seleucia Pieria just to the north Lane Fox suggests instead this same voyage of coastal destruction was undertaken by Ptolemy in 312 BC

AlMina served as an outpost for cultural influences that accompanied trade with Urartu and the shortest caravan route to Assyrian cities of upper Mesopotamia Through AlMina and Greek traders in Cyprus the Phoenician alphabet and other technology were transmitted to Euboea and mainland Greece in the eighth century BC AlMina was destroyed about 700 BC perhaps by Sennacherib who repressed a rebellion at Tarsos in 696 BC but it was immediately rebuilt Pottery recovered from later levels of the site shows that a Greek presence remained at AlMina through to the fourth century BC with pottery imported from Miletus and deftly imitated locally apparently by Greek potters

Fools for Love
Fools for Love is the fifth episode of the third season of House and the fiftyfirst episode overall

A young interracial couple is hospitalized after the husband Jeremy attacks robbers who threaten his wife Tracy Her airway closes and she collapses apparently experiencing anaphylaxis Dr House however is distracted by the sight of Dr Wilson chatting to an attractive new nurse Wendy in the hallway House is convinced that Wilson is dating her

Chase suggests that Tracy and Jeremy have smoked marijuana tainted with salmonella so House orders treatment with fluoroquinolone antibiotic Tracy develops a rash in response to this antibiotic so House extrapolates that the anxiety of being attacked caused Tracy to secrete too much adrenaline and go into an exercisetriggered anaphylaxis While Foreman tests this hypothesis by having her run on a treadmill Jeremy becomes angry and begins experiencing chest and stomach pain The team wonders whether to attribute their common stomach pain to a shared infection or a shared environment Upon inspecting their small apartment Chase and Foreman find only a package of condoms

Meanwhile House sees a patient named Michael Tritter during his clinic hours When House refuses to run tests on Tritters rash attributing it to dehydration a confrontation ensues Tritter trips House House swabs the rash and House leaves Tritter with a thermometer inserted in his rectum while House leaves for the day

While discussing Tracy and Jeremys case House breaks into Wendys locker and guesses that a jazz festival flier in a locker full of novels means that she is indulging Wilsons interest in jazz He bets Foreman 200 that the nurse and Wilson are in a relationship

House takes Tracy off the steroids reasoning that if she develops a fever the problem is an infection and that if she doesnt the problem is environmental Tracy experiences a hallucination of Jeremys late father who was violently opposed to their relationship she screams Foreman arrives to find her lapsing into a dissociative coma After comparing Tracys MRI to Jeremys earlier chest Xray House suspects sarcoidosis and tells the team to perform a brainstem biopsy for confirmation Concerned about the procedures risks to Tracy and the potential conflict of interest in asking Jeremy to consent on her behalf Cameron asks Cuddy to have a guardian ad litem represent Tracy Tracys condition worsens too quickly so Wilson is asked to present Jeremy with the options Jeremy requests that they withdraw his treatment so that they can biopsy him instead

Cuddy calls House to her office where clinic patient Michael Tritter David Morse is waiting Tritter demands an apology from House but House flatly refuses and leaves the office

Meanwhile Jeremys condition has worsened but instead of brain swelling his lactic acid levels are rising which should mean his intestines have begun to rot House speculates that he and Tracy do not share the same disease after all He orders that Tracy be treated for porphyria and that Jeremys bowel be biopsied Foreman discovers that Jeremys bowels are not rotting at all House learns that Jeremy and Tracy grew up as neighbors and ran off at age 16 to escape Jeremys father and his opposition to the relationship House muses on Tracys and Jeremys green eyes and realizes that they share hereditary angioedema a rare hereditary condition that prevents their bodies from producing a vital protein and that they are probably halfsiblings House orders Foreman to tell them Reluctantly Foreman does so Tracy reacts badly

Later Chase Jesse Spencer asks Foreman Omar Epps to cover some of his weekend oncall hours but Foreman refuses saying evasively that he is going out of town When Foreman admits he is going to a jazz festival with the new nurse House reluctantly pays him the 200 As Foreman leaves he sees that Tracy has moved out of the hospital room she shared with Jeremy so Foreman stays with the devastated young man for a while Meanwhile Cuddy is observed with a pregnancy test which to her dismay reads negative

House speeds home on his motorcycle He is pulled over by a police officer who turns out to be Michael Tritter Tritter arrests him for possession of narcotics

After stopping House for speeding officer Tritter reasons that House is under the influence of narcotics based on his observation that Houses pupils are dilated House however uses Vicodin a hydrocodonecontaining drug which if anything would cause pupillary constriction miosis

Dead End Run
Dead End Run is a 2003 film directed by Japanese cult film director Sogo Ishii notable for Ishiis trademark flashy visual style

The film has little plot to speak of but is instead divided into three short episodes each of which opens with a man desperately running away before being trapped in a dead end where something outoftheordinary occurs The episodes include a musical number a Mexican standoff and a police pursuit

The first episode begins with an extended scene showing a man desperately running through an urban landscape before coming to a dead end in a dark backstreet ally When he hears approaching footsteps he attacks his presumed pursuer with a metal bar He is shocked to find that he has instead killed a young woman

However the woman comes back to life and sings and dances with the man in the style of a musical film telling him how they were fated to meet and how tragic it is that their love has to be so short Once again she dies and while the man grieves over her body his pursuer appears and shoots him The mans and womans bodies lie next to each other on the tarmac

The second episode also begins with a fleeing man who gets trapped in a dead end where he becomes involved in a protracted Mexican standoff with another man The scene is intercut with a similar standoff involving two different armed men in the same location Both standoffs end with the two protagonists laughing at their predicament and entering a friendly embrace before trying to shoot the other man All the men receive gunshot wounds and die their bodies falling in positions similar to the couple in the first episode of the film

The third episode starts with three police officers chasing a suspect The suspect flees to the top of a tall building where a young woman is sitting The edge of the roof is in effect a dead end The suspect takes the woman hostage After a standoff she manages to take the suspects gun and to everyones surprise points it at her own head threatening suicide When the suspect tries to knock the gun out of her hand they fall together from the roof Although they expect to die they actually land in a lorry carrying a cargo of feathers The episode ends with the couple lying together in a similar physical position to the couples in the previous episodes except that this time both characters are still alive

Tracks novel
Tracks is a novel by Louise Erdrich published in 1988 It is the third in a tetralogy of novels beginning with Love Medicine that explores the interrelated lives of four Anishinaabe families living on an Indian reservation near the fictional town of Argus North Dakota Within the saga Tracks is earliest chronologically providing the backstory of several characters such as Lulu Lamartine and Marie Kashpaw who become prominent in the other novels As in many of her other novels Erdrich employs the use of multiple firstperson narratives to relate the events of the plot alternating between Nanapush a tribal patriarch and Pauline a young girl of mixed heritage

Tracks alternates between two narrators Nanapush a jovial tribal elder and Pauline a young girl of mixed heritage In Nanapushs chapters the point of view is that of Nanapush telling stories to his granddaughter Lulu several years after the main events in the novel occur When Lulu was ten years old her mother Fleur Pillager sent her away to a government school Because of this Lulu is now estranged from her mother Nanapush therefore narrates the story in attempt to reconcile mother and daughter by telling Lulu about the events between 1912 and 1924 that led Fleur to her decision

Nanapush first meets Fleur in 1912 when he rescues her in the middle of winter and nurses her back to health from consumption  a recent epidemic among the Anishinaabe Because of their shared grief at losing so many from their community Nanapush and Fleur develop a friendship and begin to see one another as family The next year Fleur goes to the nearby town of Argus and takes a job at a butchers shop where she meets Pauline Puyat  the novels second narrator After beating a group of men from the shop one night at a game of poker Fleur is beaten and raped She leaves town but the next day a tornado strikes Argus Mysteriously no one in town is harmed in the storm with the exception of the men who raped her  whose bodies are found locked in the freezer of the butcher shop where they had taken refuge

Fleur returns to her family home on the reservation where she meets Eli Kashpaw while hunting in the woods one day Much to his mothers dismay Eli falls in love with Fleur and moves in with her Soon Fleur begins to show signs that she is pregnant and although the true paternity is unknown Eli takes responsibility of the child as his own A new family unit begins to form at the Pillager home  Fleur Eli and their daughter Lulu as well as Elis mother Margaret and her second son Nector Throughout the novel Margaret and Nanapush whom Fleur regards as a father also develop an intimate relationship Together the family faces trials of hunger tribal conflict and ultimately the loss of their land to the government

In the meantime Pauline has also left Argus She stays with a widow named Bernadette Morrissey from whom she learns the art of tending the sick and dying She stays in Argus and visits Nanapush and the family home as an unwanted guest Pauline serves as a midwife to Fleur during an early birth She becomes increasingly jealous of Fleur and her relationship and in an attempt to break them up feeds a sort of love potion to Eli and a younger girl named Sophie inducing them to copulate passionately in the forest Claiming to have received a vision she decides to join a convent where she only delves further into obsession She devotes herself to the cause of converting Fleur and the others but is generally regarded as a nuisance She develops several unusual habits as a means of selfinflicting suffering to remind herself of Christs suffering Her behaviors are frowned upon by the superior nun and she is eventually sent away to teach mathematics at a Catholic school Paulines narratives deal with her own personal story and also provide a second perspective on many of the same events described by Nanapush

One major theme in Tracks is the tension between traditional Anishinaabe culture and beliefs and the Westernizing influence of white Christian America This clash can clearly be seen in the two characters of Fleur and Pauline as Michelle R Hessler writes Fleur upholds the traditions of her ancestors and attempts to save their land from the rapid advance of white civilization whereas Pauline enters a cloister denies her Native American heritage and brings death and destruction to the reservation

Contradictions lies and doublevoicedness have also been identified as major themes in Tracks by some critics As the plot unfolds the narrator Nanapush is able to use his gift of speech to negotiate with government representatives on behalf of his people but he often tells contradictory stories and even outright lies Similarly Paulines narrative is unreliable and often contradictory

Some critics view Nanapush as a reliable narrator As critic Susan Stanford Friedman argues the novel overtly sets up a contrast between Nanapush as the reliable narrator who retains his Anishinabe religion and the unreliable narrator the convert Pauline whose selfhatred takes the form of a denial of her Indian heritage and the adoption of a selfdestructive Catholicism

Nanapush is a critical character in the tension between the Anishinaabe and the whites because of his trickster qualities and ability to navigate both sides of the conflict through talking Anishinaabe scholar Lawrence W Gross points out that Nanapushs association with the mythical figure Nanabozho helps him to survive by enabling him to adapt white culture to his own traditions and interests arguing that it is the tricksters who survive to build a new world on the ashes of the old Literary critic Sheila Hassel Hughes further expands on this notion by commenting on Nanapushs duplicitous speech which like that of the prophet or the trickster works simultaneously to undermine the power of the privileged oppressor and to appeal for his or her realignment on the side of the oppressed

Maria DePriest also points out that while Fleur is obviously the central character in the book she does not get to narrate her own story Fleur must battle two fronts  not only the external conflict of white America that threatens to take away her ancestral land but also internal betrayals from her own people  but her story is told at a distance by Nanapush and Pauline both of whom are unreliable narrators

Fleur has been described as one of the most haunting presences in contemporary American literature and Tracks is also characterized by the theme of haunting Fleur is described as having mystical shamanistic powers and at one point even travels to the spirit world to negotiate for the life of her second child Several references are made to the manitou including Misshepeshu the lake spirit who is said to be a guardian of the Pillager family and the windigo For instance in the first chapter of the novel Nanapush describes his and Fleurs descent into grief at the loss of so many of their people to consumption saying We had gone half windigo I learned later that this was common that there were many of our people who died in this manner of the invisible sickness There were those who could not swallow another bite of food because the names of their dead anchored their tongues Their grief is characterized as a gripping depression verging on madness Madness itself is also a motif in the novel  manifesting most notably in the characters of Pauline with her masochistic selfmortification methods and Fleur particularly following the death of her second child Beidler notes that madness is associated with the characters emotional distress at the destruction of their environment by the white logging company

Tracks is part of a cycle of books all set in the same fictional community and dealing with many of the same characters and families  the Kashpaws Pillagers and Morrisseys Other books in the saga include Love Medicine The Beet Queen The Bingo Palace Four Souls and The Painted Drum Tales of Burning Love which features Sister Leopolda Pauline is also loosely related Erdrichs method of writing these related histories of families from the same community has been compared to William Faulkner and his creation of Yoknapatawpha County

After her success with Love Medicine and The Beet Queen Erdrich was unsure of what to write about next She had a 400page manuscript that was to be the foundation for Tracks but regarded it as her burden With the help of her husband Michael Dorris she decided she could use the story to continue the saga of Love Medicine and The Beet Queen

The first edition of Tracks was published in 1988 but several of its chapters had been published previously as short stories These include


Tracks received mixed reviews at the time of its publication with most critics identifying Erdrichs vivid language and narrative structure as either effective or not

RZ Sheppard criticized Erdrichs use of alternating narratives as too schematic and forced  and characterized her graphic descriptions as too grandiose Crammed into a short intense novel Sheppard wrote her characters are too busy hauling symbolic freight to reveal their humanity Similarly The New Statesman and Society criticized the novel for being too vivid and heavyhanded with language writing Erdrichs linguistic profusion veers toward sentimentalizing a people and their history

In The New York Times Book Review Jean Strouse found Tracks to be a bit more didactic and wrought than Erdrichs previous novels and more political as well She also highlighted concerns over whether or not Tracks could even be considered a true novel since four of its nine chapters had been previously published as short stories  including one Snares which was controversially published in Best American Short Stories an anthology that claims it does not admit novel excerpts Nonetheless Strouse also praised Erdrich for centering on life instead of self in the novel and called Tracks a welcome contrast to much of mainstream 1980s fiction

Other reviewers responded positively to the novel including Barbara Hoffert who called it splendid and wrote that Erdrichs prose is as sharp glittering and to the point as cut glass Christopher Vecsey in Commonweal compared her writing to the magical realism employed by writers such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Andrew WelshHuggins placed her in the company of contemporary writers like Anne Tyler John Updike and Toni Morrison The reviewer for Choice compared her writing style to William Faulkner identified by Erdrich as one of her favorite authors

USCGC Campbell WMEC909
USCGC Campbell WMEC909 is a United States Coast Guard medium endurance cutter based at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery Maine Campbell is the sixth Coast Guard Cutter to bear the name and is assigned to the Atlantic The ship bears the distinction of having made some of the largest narcotics seizures in Coast Guard history as well as being the command ship for the TWA 800 recovery effort

The ship WMEC909s name primarily commemorates USCGC Campbell WPG32 was sunk as a training target in November 1984 A final message broadcast as she went down almost completely intact following a strike from a Harpoon missile proclaimed the birth of the USCGC Campbell WMEC909 It concluded with the words The Queen is dead Long live the Queen a reference to the Queen of the Seas title bestowed on the prior Campbell during her 46 years of service

The keel for WMEC909 had been laid at the Derecktor shipyard in Middletown Rhode Island on 10 August 1984 She was launched on 29 April 1986 and commissioned into service on 19 August 1988 The USCGC Campbell was the ninth of thirteen Famousclass cutters built by Derecktor to replace World War II and preWorld War II cutters

The Campbell regularly patrols the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Maine to the Caribbean Sea Like the other Famousclass cutters she was designed and built for multimission tasks in law enforcement search and rescue marine environmental protection and military preparedness Her mission is defined by the Coast Guard as Search and Rescue Enforcement of Laws and Treaties Fisheries Law Enforcement Drug Interdiction Alien and Migrant Interdiction Homeland Port Security

In the course of fulfilling this mission Campbell has received more than one USCG Meritorious Unit Commendation

The first significant accomplishment of the new USCGC Campbell was the rescue of three survivors of the hurricane shipwreck of the SV Moorings 38 after six days at sea in September 1991

On 5 January 1992 the Campbell interdicted the freighter Harbour with 10422lbs of cocaine on board The freighters crew attempted to burn and scuttle the ship but crewmen from the Campbell successfully salvaged the vessel and the evidence on board Other cocaine seizures include 480 kilos in March 1996 dropped by air over 1000 kilos from the MV Sea Cliff in 1996 and 29 tons from the former US Navy tug Coshecton in January 1998

In July 1996 the Campbell responded to the crash of TWA Flight 800 in the Atlantic securing the area from intrusion and serving as onscene command for the retrieval and initial investigation

While engaged in flight operations off the coast of Honduras the evening of 29 January 2001 a large wave rocked the Campbell just as HH6571 an HH65 Dolphin helicopter was touching down The helicopter rolled to its side impacting the deck with its rotors 8 people were injured in the accident

The US Army Institute of Heraldry designed a new coat of arms for USCGC Campbell Using colors from the traditions of Clan Campbell it features a sixpoint ships wheel a symbol of seaworthiness representing the six Campbells on a blue shield for defense and protection with gold top that features a battering ram to symbolize the World War II ramming of U606 by the WPG32 topped with a crown recalling WPG32s title Queen of the Seas accented with alternating blue and gold lightning bolts representing faststrike capability held between two seahorses found likewise on the crest of WPG32 above a gold ribbon with the words Tradition Pride Readiness on a white background Surrounding the image is a blue border with gold trim and gold words USCGC Campbell WMEC 909

The Campbell was mentioned in John Ringos 2013 book Under a Graveyard Sky where it was found adrift following a zombie apocalypse The few survivors of the ship join their rescuers once all the afflicted crew members have been eliminated

Creek Turnpike
The Creek Turnpike also designated State Highway 364 SH364 is a freewaystandard toll road that lies entirely in the US state of Oklahoma The turnpike forms a partial beltway around the south and east sides of Tulsa Oklahomas second largest city The Creek Turnpikes western terminus is at the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa while its northeastern terminus is at the Will Rogers Turnpike in Fair Oaks both ends of the Creek Turnpike connect with Interstate 44 I44 Along the way the highway passes through the cities of Sapulpa Jenks Tulsa and Broken Arrow and the counties of Creek Tulsa Wagoner and Rogers The road is maintained by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority OTA except for a brief free section shared with US Route 64 US64 and US169 This free section is maintained by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation ODOT

The first section of the Creek Turnpike from US75 in Jenks to US64US169 in Tulsa was first authorized in 1987 with construction beginning in 1989 The turnpikes construction was controversial homeowners along the route of the highway formed a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes to fight the highway in both the courtroom and the media The highway was also challenged on environmental grounds with impacts upon wetlands and endangered species being the chief concerns Nevertheless the highway opened to traffic in three sections starting from the easternmost over the course of the first half of 1992

Further extensions to both the east and the west followed in later years after several years of false starts under the administrations of two different governors Expansion of the highway was finally approved in 1998 The extension to the west linking the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike in Sapulpa opened December 15 2000 The extension to the east opened in three parts over the course of 2001 and 2002

The Creek Turnpike begins at I44 Turner Turnpike exit 217 in the city of Sapulpa This interchange only provides access from eastbound I44 to the Creek Turnpike and from the Creek Turnpike to westbound I44 The turnpike runs in a general southeast direction from this terminus towards the CreekTulsa county line crossing over Polecat Creek Upon crossing into Tulsa County the toll road turns to a more easterly course The highway enters Jenks less than one mile approximately 16km east of the county line In Jenks the highway has a modified cloverleaf interchange at US75 the westbound Turnpike to southbound US75 ramp is a directional ramp rather than a loop ramp The Creek Turnpike then passes through the first of three barrier toll plazas Near the interchange with Elm Street signed as PeoriaElm Elm Street is named Peoria Avenue outside of Jenks the highway bridges Polecat Creek again before crossing the Arkansas River into Tulsa

In Tulsa the Creek Turnpike has an interchange at Memorial Drive which carries US64 south of the toll road At this interchange Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US64 onto a free road forming the Mingo Valley Expressway US169 also begins at this interchange heading north from here toward its other end in Virginia Minnesota As the Mingo Valley Expressway carrying US64US169 turns north the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast The highway leaves Tulsa entering Broken Arrow where it crosses over Haikey Creek The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza then turns back east

In southeast Broken Arrow the Creek Turnpike crosses the county line into Wagoner County and swings towards the northnortheast It then meets SH51 followed by the Muskogee Turnpike SH351 near that highways western terminus The Creek Turnpike passes through the third and final barrier toll after reentering Tulsa From the toll plaza the turnpike proceeds north to end at the I44US412 interchange which straddles the WagonerRogers County county line The portion of the interchange that sits in Rogers County also lies in the town of Fair Oaks The mainline Creek Turnpike becomes the Will Rogers Turnpike as eastbound I44 merges onto the roadway

Exit numbers are absent along the Creek Turnpike until the 51st Street South interchange which is numbered as exit 28 Exit numbers are posted north of this interchange continuing until the highways terminus exits 33AB The Creek Turnpikes exit numbering is used for the final two exits on the westbound Will Rogers Turnpikethe westboundonly Pine Street exit exit 35 and the westbound I44 ramp exit 34

The entirety of the Creek Turnpike has been recognized as important to the countrys economy defense and mobility by its inclusion in the National Highway System In 2011 the highest average annual daily traffic AADT count was 26900 vehicles eastbound and 26476 vehicles westbound between the Yale Avenue and Memorial Drive interchanges The lowest AADT counts 4426 vehicles eastbound and 4463 vehicles westbound were recorded between the 11th Street interchange and the northeastern terminus Law enforcement along the Creek Turnpike is provided by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troop XE a special troop assigned to the turnpike

As early as the late 1950s plans for a Tulsa freeway system included a route along 96th Street South The 96th Street corridor was accessible to more motorists than other corridors further south farther away from the urban core while still having low rightofway costs comparable to more southerly corridors This made it the ideal route for a south Tulsa freeway In 1986 ODOT had plans to build a tollfree facility called the Creek Freeway in the corridor as part of SH117

A south Tulsa turnpike was first authorized by OTA in 1987 the same time as three other turnpikes that would ultimately become the Cherokee Chickasaw and John Kilpatrick turnpikes Eleven possible routings were researched before OTA settled on the 96th Street corridor as the site of the proposed turnpike On February 16 1989 OTA sold 5584 million in revenue bonds about  in dollars to cover the cost of all four proposed turnpikes

As originally planned the Creek Turnpike was to begin at US75 and end at Memorial Drive for a total length of  ODOT would then build a 26 million approximately  in dollars freeway connection from the eastern terminus of the turnpike at Memorial Drive to tie in with the south end of the Mingo Valley Expressway OTA intended the turnpike to be built on a fast track with construction to be complete by the close of 1991 The estimated cost to construct this first segment of the Creek Turnpike was 85 million about  in dollars Initially the highway was planned to have an median with a Jersey barrier which would meet minimum AASHTO requirements of  Later plans expanded this to a grass median Four toll plazas were planned with one mainline plaza collecting a fiftycent toll no matter what distance was traveled

Tulsa mayor Rodger Randles committee on the Creek Turnpike submitted a report to OTA on April 13 1989 requesting that the agency make 47 changes to the turnpike Among the changes proposed by the city was a shift in the route of to the north between Yale Avenue and Sheridan Road to accommodate a greenway along both sides of the turnpike The committee also recommended wider overpasses to accommodate future expansion of surface streets such as Delaware Avenue moving the mainline toll plaza farther east to minimize impact on the surrounding area and better compliance with local flood prevention ordinances In addition the report suggested better pedestrian access including pedestrian bridges on both sides of the Arkansas River and near Hunter Park and various sidewalks and pedestrian tunnels

OTA immediately agreed that some of the more minor changes to the turnpikes plans could be made but expressed doubt that more major alterations would be made Several of the proposed changes including the greenway were highlighted as major expenses Nonetheless OTA agreed to evaluate the citys proposals Board member and future Tulsa mayor Dewey F Bartlett Jr said We are not set in stone but its a matter of economics Mayor Randle stated his desire for a written agreement regarding the changes to be drawn up and signed by the city and OTA before ground was broken on the turnpike

On June 18 1989 OTA officials announced that the majority of the citys proposed amendments to the Creek Turnpike would be incorporated into the design The alterations added 6 million about  in dollars to the cost of the project However the revised plan required the demolition of only 41 houses six fewer than originally planned Further alterations were negotiated throughout the latter half of 1989 with OTA and Tulsa reaching an agreement on December 29 The plans were adapted to include flood and noise control provisions To meet these requirements the highway would be lowered with some sections belowgrade In exchange the City of Tulsa agreed to pay 13 million in annual maintenance costs until 2020 The deal also included a land swap with the city giving OTA land from Hunter Park and receiving land along the rightofway to construct recreational trails

OTA began filing condemnation suits for homes within the Creek Turnpikes proposed rightofway on June 30 1989 Condemnation the process by which a government exercises its powers of eminent domain was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November Contracts for utility relocation grading and drainage work were awarded at OTAs November 16 meeting Meanwhile work began on the condemned properties with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990

Drainage work was in progress by late February 1990 Construction was underway on turnpike bridges by March 1990 While federal environmental permits were being secured the construction process was delayed by October 1990 the bridge construction was only at the point that had been planned to have been completed in May and grading and paving work had yet to begin In December 1990 contractors on the Creek Turnpike project were given notice to proceed as the permits had been granted By that time construction had only progressed to the point that it was supposed to have been at in late July Nevertheless by April 1991 OTAs chief executive officer Richard Ridings described the project as moving very well and said My own personal opinion is its up to the contractors If they want to produce it can be open by the end of the year

The first section of the Creek Turnpike to open was a segment from Delaware Avenue to its eastern terminus at Memorial Drive which opened to traffic at 7pm on March 13 1992 Tolls were waived until 1201am on March 16 The next section to the west from Elm Street in Jenks to Delaware Avenue including the Arkansas River bridge opened the afternoon of April 15 The final leg of the first segment of the turnpike from US75 to Elm Street opened at noon on July 30 The Creek Turnpike was initially posted with a speed limit due to the National Maximum Speed Limit law then in effect Traffic levels on the new highway were about double what was expected with an average of 9000 vehicles per day using the turnpike in August 1992 a 1988 estimate predicted only 3000 to 5000 vehicles would use the road each day

The Creek Turnpike was opposed by area residents from its conception Forming a group called Tulsans Against Turnpikes around 220 citizens gathered at a meeting on February 16 1989 to discuss the proposed toll road Opponents to the turnpike cited detrimental effects to their community and to the environment as their concerns What I am concerned about is that it changes the complexion of south Tulsa It would no longer be a residential area said Tom Taylor an area resident Some residents also complained that the proposed turnpike would mainly serve through traffic despite OTA estimates that south Tulsa residents would make up 90 of the roads userbase

On March 22 1989 three Will Rogers Turnpike tollbooth attendants made a surprise appearance at a Tulsans Against Turnpikes press conference to offer support to the opposition movement expressing dissatisfaction with working conditions while manning the turnpike The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had convinced them that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed OTA responded to their employees remarks by highlighting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study that found that the toll gate that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards

In late June 1989 opponents of the turnpike boycotted local businesses that were members of the Metropolitan Tulsa Chamber of Commerce which was in favor of the turnpike Some turnpike protesters removed their names from the customer list at Mazzios Italian Eatery on June 23 On June 24 about forty protesters picketed the Bank of Oklahoma and around six closed their accounts The chief executives of both businesses were on the board of the Chamber of Commerce In response to the boycott Mayor Randle issued a statement accusing Tulsans Against Turnpikes of seeking to wage economic coercion against businesses and described their tactics as working as a kind of economic blackmail to silence debate as well as allowing differences of opinion to degenerate into intimidation against those who have taken public stands unpopular with Tulsans Against Turnpikes Randle also canceled a planned meeting with the group refusing to meet with them until they ceased the boycott A Tulsans Against Turnpikes board member publicly replied to the mayors statement by denying that a boycott was taking place stating that the group only recommended that members not do business with Mazzios and Bank of Oklahoma because of their support for the Creek Turnpike project via their activity with the Chamber of Commerce He also suggested that Randle was simply looking for an excuse to avoid the meeting

The environmental group Greenpeace became involved with the opposition movement in October 1989 Holding a joint rally with Tulsans Against Turnpikes and several environmental groups at Hunter Park a Greenpeace spokeswoman said on October 20 that the Creek Turnpikes construction will be setting up Oklahoma as a hazardous waste dumping ground Greenpeaces regional coordinator was scheduled to speak at an area library on the same day but his appearance was canceled when the organizations bus ran out of fuel A local resident at the Hunter Park forum was quoted as being concerned that the turnpike may allow eastern states such as New York to ship AIDScontaminated freight through the area

In November 1989 Jenks resident Gary Medlin and two Jenks city councilmen drafted a letter to OTA requesting that the agency cease all work on the Creek Turnpike The letter was approved by the Jenks City Council on November 20 The letter also included a petition in opposition to the turnpike with over 1000 signatures

A grand jury petition bearing over 1400 signatures across 134 pages was filed with the Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6 1989 The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the states open meetings conspiracy and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1000 signatures on December 15 Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation After meeting for seven days on January 19 1990 the grand jury determined that there was no evidence to support the allegations and no need for further investigation

Some protesters resorted to illegal means to demonstrate their opposition to the project In December 1989 trees and shrubbery on condemned lots were destroyed in an attempt to prevent them from being transplanted by landscapers A field office belonging to M J Lee Construction Co a contractor working on the project was burglarized on March 4 1990 The perpetrators stole or destroyed tools and poured oil on planning documents A week later the fuel lines on heavy equipment were slashed On the night of April 26 several vehicles at a Creek Turnpike worksite belonging to M J Lee were vandalized the vandals smashed windshields and headlights stole fuel caps and dumped mud into the fuel tanks Messages reading Death to OTA Death to Governor Henry Bellmon and Death to Bartlett who had recently also become a Tulsa city councilman were written in mud on the side of a water truck at the site The vice president of the firm emphasized that the company alone bore the brunt of the estimated 10000 equivalent to  in  financial loss not OTA and offered a 1000 reward for information leading to the prosecution of the responsible party Construction signage was also removed or covered up with Tulsans Against Turnpikes signs and survey markers were relocated Tulsans Against Turnpikes publicly condemned the vandalism offering an additional 500 reward for information A member of the groups board stated We deplore this kind of cowardly illegal action There is no reason for some sick person to take out frustrations on the contractor In response to the vandalism Tulsa police launched an investigation and OTA stated that Oklahoma Highway Patrol officers would be on patrol in the construction areas On August 11 1990 a contractor arriving for work discovered a vandal attempting to break the window of a crane As the employee approached the crane four people fled the scene The employee was able to detain two of them both aged eighteen until police arrived and cited them for misdemeanor malicious mischief

The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority was exempt from requirements to have a federal environmental impact study EIS conducted on the Creek Turnpike project As part of their opposition to the turnpike Tulsans Against Turnpikes challenged this right The group announced in April 1989 that if the Environmental Protection Agency EPA US Department of Transportation USDOT and US Department of Defense DOD did not force OTA to conduct an EIS within 60 days they would sue the three federal agencies Tulsans Against Turnpikes joined by an area homeowners association John Reidel a homeowner whose property was condemned by OTA and had filed previous suits as early as the 1950s to stop the turnpikes construction and several other affected individuals filed the suit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma on August 10 Defendants in the suit included the federal agencies state transportation and environmental agencies and the city of Tulsa That November Tulsans Against Turnpikes filed a motion requesting an injunction against further work on the turnpike

On January 27 1990 US District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett dismissed seven of the nine claims before him and on March 24 the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities In support of their filings the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways OTA responded by producing US Army Corps of Engineers USACE documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity OTA argued that the plaintiffs requests for a restraining order and reconsideration of the dismissed claims were invalid because there was no change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration

At a hearing on May 22 1990 Judge Brett announced his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims ending the lawsuit and ruled all remaining pending motions moot At the hearing Brett said that the issue at the heart of the suit was the highways effect on area residents While this was a legitimate interest the judge said it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies

Initial turnpike plans included environmental mitigation features to reduce the amount of disruption the finished road would cause to the local environment In the Jenks area OTA planned to replace destroyed wetlands with new wetlands of equal or greater size Landscapers were expected to plant two trees for every one removed to build the road In March 1990 these plans were augmented to provide wetlands mitigation at a rate of three to one for a total of of new wetlands Additionally of pasture would be allowed to revert to its natural state to create dedicated natural succession areas

On July 21 1989 OTA approved a contract to transplant approximately 290 live trees in the path of the turnpike to locations along the edge of the rightofway There the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic A Norman landscaping firm performed the work which included thirty months of maintenance for a total cost of 28850 per tree equivalent to  in dollars

The Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA objected to the construction of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30 1990 FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the floodplains in the area was lacking preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs OTAs attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials and it was not OTAs responsibility to ensure that they forwarded the information on to FEMA

A Tulsaarea supervisor with the US Fish and Wildlife Service FWS commented upon environmental issues pertaining to the Creek Turnpike in a 19page letter to the US Army Corps of Engineers dated February 9 1990 USACE was responsible for issuing three essential permits which OTA had applied for on November 6 1989 that would allow construction to continue and was required to consider input from the service In the letter supervisor Stephen Forsythe recommended that the permits be denied and further studies conducted into alternate routes for the turnpike and the environmental impact on roads that connected to the turnpike However USACE only had the authority to review the impacts the Creek Turnpike itself made on wetland areas Governor Bellmon publicly criticized Forsythe for focusing on concerns beyond USACEs jurisdiction Bellmons Transportation Secretary Neal McCaleb publicly stated I think Forsythe is out of line and would say so to Mr Forsythe Bellmon and McCaleb discussed the letter in a private meeting with the Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan although Lujan neither commented nor committed to any action regarding the letter In response to Bellmons criticism of the letter Tulsans Against Turnpikes issued a public statement saying Running behind closed political doors like that demonstrates the governor is an environmental hypocrite contrasting his statements with a letter he wrote assuring a constituent in Jenks that the project would be the most aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sound facility that can be constructed

In a letter sent to OTA in March 1990 USACE identified issues with the Creek Turnpike project such as modifications to Polecat Creeks channel impacts on the Arkansas River floodplain and levee system near Jenks and loss of of wetlands In two other letters sent in May 1990 USACE requested alterations to the project detailing further concerns about destruction of a unique type of wetland near the turnpikes planned intersection with Yale Avenue OTAs plan to temporarily drain Mill Creek Bridge Pond and emergency access to homes only accessible by crossing the pond on a wooden bridge USACE warned that should the changes the corps requested not be made the turnpike plans may violate federal law which would result in USACE withholding the necessary permits The corps also required absolute assurance that new wetlands constructed as part of the projects mitigation efforts would not be built on land that was formerly the site of a landfill On March 29 USACE held a public hearing as part of the permit process The hearing had around 500 attendees with over fifty of them giving fiveminute speeches against the turnpike One speaker compared the highways environmental impact to that of the wreck of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez No citizens spoke out in favor of the project

OTA announced plans to include sound barriers at three points along the turnpike in April 1990 The locations were recommended by a report commissioned by OTA using guidelines published by the Federal Highway Administration FHWA While another thirteen locations were likely to have similar noise levels as the three sites selected to receive barriers abatement was not considered at those locations because they did not meet other criteria including minimum population density Although OTA was not required to follow FHWA guidelines on the Creek Turnpike because it was not a federally funded project it opted to do so anyway

Another letter dated June 21 1990 was sent by FWS to USACE reporting that at least eight interior least terns an endangered species had been found on a small island in the Arkansas River approximately south of the site of the proposed turnpike bridge Although the bridge was not yet under construction at the time the anticipated eighteenmonth period of bridge construction had the possibility of interfering with the terns nesting period which runs from midMay to midAugust FWS was also in favor of requiring OTA to prepare a full EIS a process that could have taken up to three years

Further delays on the Creek Turnpike project appeared inevitable in October 1990 as a new area meeting the federal definition of a wetland was discovered in the path of the turnpike OTA officials did not bring the area to USACEs attention because they did not believe it met the criteria to be considered a wetland Frustration mounted after the find rumors surfaced that OTA was considering canceling the Creek Turnpike and shifting the remaining funds to turnpike projects in the Oklahoma City area In an interview after an OTA meeting chairman John Kilpatrick was quoted as saying God only knows when the Creek Turnpike will be completed describing the project as a total disaster and commenting If we had it all to do over again we wouldnt do that project OTA was concerned about the financial impact of USACEs delay in issuing the required permits each day after the planned opening date that the project ran late added 20000 approximately  in dollars to the total cost of the project USACE finally issued the permit on November 15 over a year after OTA applied for it

One stipulation the USACE placed on the permit however was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site As a result OTA worked to complete the bridge as quickly as possible to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction By April 1991 work in the riverbed was mostly complete with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns

The possibility of extending the Creek Turnpike beyond its original termini at US75 and Memorial Drive was raised as early as 1993 On May 28 1993 Governor David Walters announced a proposed 31 billion around  in dollars turnpike package one part of which was the extension of the Creek Turnpike to the Turner Turnpike to the west and the Will Rogers Turnpike in the east As a result of negotiations between Walters other lawmakers and OTA the package was ultimately pared down to 675 million about  in dollars among the cuts was the eastern extension of the Creek Turnpike This version of the package was approved by OTA on August 18 1994 The package was ultimately killed almost two months later when the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission voted 42 to stop the sale of the bonds associated with the project on October 3 Reasons for opposition to the package were varied including concerns over OTAs debt level toll increases necessary to fund the package the state of the bond market a federal investigation examining previous OTA bond sales lack of details given about the package the size of the package and the proposed method by which the bonds would be sold

Another Creek Turnpike expansion proposal connecting it again to the Turner Turnpike in the west but only extending it as far as the Muskogee Turnpike in the east was put forward by Walterss successor Governor Frank Keating in 1996 This proposal accompanied by a proposed extension to the Kilpatrick Turnpike in Oklahoma City was to be funded by increasing tolls by 10 percent statewide in 1999 Keatings turnpike package too encountered trouble from the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission The body unanimously voted on July 25 1996 to postpone an upordown vote on the projects which together carried a price tag of 525 million approximately  in dollars until more information was made available to its members Keating declared the package dead in response to the commissions action

The Creek Turnpike extensions resurfaced in a 1998 turnpike expansion plan OTA approved a 724 million about  in dollars bond package at its meeting on January 9 1998 This package which carried the support of both Governor Keating and legislative leaders included a extension of the Creek Turnpike to the Turner and Will Rogers turnpikes extension of the Kilpatrick Turnpike and a new toll road which would become the HE Bailey Turnpike Norman Spur The plan which was to be funded by a 15 systemwide toll increase was approved by both the Legislative Bond Oversight Commission and Executive Bond Oversight Commission on January 29 1998

Construction of the portion of the highway between the eastern terminus and the Muskogee Turnpike known as the Broken Arrow south loop was scheduled to begin in May 1999 and be completed in January 2001 The section from the Muskogee Turnpike north to the Will Rogers Turnpike was to begin construction in September 1999 and be completed in January 2002 Unlike the section of the turnpike built in the early 1990s this section was expected to displace few residents the city of Broken Arrow had purchased much of the rightofway ahead of time to preserve the corridor for the expected turnpike

While construction of the other two sections of the turnpike ran according to schedule progress on the Broken Arrow south loop lagged behind Cost overruns due to higherthanestimated land acquisition costs caused delays as the project was revised to save money The project was stalled further by the May 3 1999 tornado outbreak as utility contractors were pulled off the project to contribute to service restoration efforts in the Oklahoma City area By August 1999 the south loop was six months behind schedule Despite the costsaving measures the south loop remained over budget by 16 million around  in dollars in July 2000 The western extension was also over budget OTA discovered over 100 abandoned oil wells that needed to be capped and leftover piping in the turnpike corridor Budget overruns on the western leg of the turnpike were 5 million about  in dollars in July 2000

The western extension was the first to open to traffic Following a brief dedication ceremony attended by Governor Keating Transportation Secretary McCaleb and OTA board member Bartlett the highway opened on December 15 2000 As with the first section of the turnpike tolls were waived for the weekend the road was free until noon on December 18 The south loop was opened in two segments The first from US64US169 to South Elm Place in Broken Arrow opened at 3pm August 15 2001 The new segment remained tollfree until 7am August 20 A rainy September pushed back the opening of the other half of the south loop by two months The second half of the south loop from Elm Place to New Orleans Street opened at 2pm April 15 2002 The final segment of the extension connecting New Orleans Street and the Muskogee Turnpike to the Will Rogers Turnpike was scheduled to open on August 16 of that year

A new interchange at Aspen Avenue in Broken Arrow opened on May 18 2012 The project was completed three weeks ahead of schedule at a cost of 6137 million of which 175 million was paid by OTA with the rest coming from the City of Broken Arrow The new interchange was expected to attract retail dining and entertainment development to the area around the interchange

A construction project that started in May 2012 expanded the turnpike to six lanes total or three lanes in each direction between US75 and Memorial Drive Throughout the project speed limits along the turnpike were reduced to  The project was completed in October 2013

The Creek Turnpike originally bore no numbered designation On March 10 2014 the Oklahoma Transportation Commission unanimously approved a motion to apply the SH364 designation to the turnpike

 motorists driving twoaxle vehicles such as cars and motorcycles pay tolls of 335 in cash or 300 if Pikepass electronic tolling is used to drive the entire length of the Creek Turnpike Drivers of vehicles with more than two axles such as truckers pay higher tolls sixaxle vehicles are charged rates of 1330 1225 with Pikepass Tolls are collected at three mainline toll plazas along the road one between the US75 and PeoriaElm interchanges one west of the Olive Avenue interchange and one labeled as the Creek East plaza south of the 31st Street South interchange Additional fares for traveling beyond the barrier tolls are collected at toll gates located at each exit as at the mainline plazas Pikepass customers receive a discounted rate at these gates

The Creek Turnpike is equipped with openroad tolling for Pikepass customers The turnpike has been completely automated since early 1996 no human toll collectors are present Cash customers pull to the right and deposit coins into toll baskets Change machines capable of changing 1 and 5 bills are available as well as machines that produce receipts for customers requiring them

USS Patterson FF1061
USS Patterson FF1061 was a United States Navy in commission from 1970 to 1991 She was named in honor of Commodore Daniel Todd Patterson 17861839 who performed distinguished service at New Orleans during the War of 1812

Patterson was built at Westwego Louisiana by Avondale Shipyard She was commissioned on 14 March 1970 conducted shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay Cuba and in June and August 1971 made her first overseas deployment a trip to northern Europe Her next deployment to the Mediterranean Sea for service with the Sixth Fleet took place during the first half of 1974 When all newer escort ships were reclassified as frigates in mid1975 Patterson became FF1061 At about this time she was also updated receiving enlarged helicopter facilities and the Basic Point Defense Missile System whose launcher for eight Sea Sparrow guided missiles was installed on her afterdeck

Patterson made another Mediterranean cruise from late 1976 to mid1977 and a third in 1978 and early 1979 In September and October 1979 the ship returned to northern European waters and in mid1980 she provided help to the West Indies island of St Lucia after it was hit by a devastating hurricane After steaming east to the Mediterranean in October 1980 Patterson voyaged onward to make a tour of the Persian Gulf during the last months of that year and the first month of 1981 A fifth Sixth Fleet cruise followed from late in 1981 into 1982 with Red Sea operations at the end of the deployment The frigate earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her activities during this time

In June 1983 Patterson was assigned to the Naval Reserve Force based at Philadelphia Pennsylvania She remained in this nondeploying status for the next eight years making frequent cruises in the western Atlantic area from Canada to the West Indies to keep Naval Reservists training up to date

In late 1990 Patterson conducted counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean taking a twoway passage through the Panama Canal as part of her work A final cruise to Bermuda in May 1991 was followed by decommissioning on 30 September 1991

After more than three years in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet Patterson was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 January 1995 Though later considered for transfer to Greece as a source of spare parts she remained in US Navy custody until late September 1999 when a contract was let for her scrapping The ship was broken up at Baltimore Maryland during the rest of 1999 and the first half of 2000

Omni wheel
Omni wheels or poly wheels similar to Mecanum wheels are wheels with small discs around the circumference which are perpendicular to the turning direction The effect is that the wheel can be driven with full force but will also slide laterally with great ease These wheels are often employed in holonomic drive systems

A platform employing three omni wheels in a triangular configuration is generally called Kiwi Drive The Killough platform is similar so named after Stephen Killoughs work with omnidirectional platforms at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Killoughs 1994 design used pairs of wheels mounted in cages at right angles to each other and thereby achieved holonomic movement without using true omni wheels

They are often used in intelligent robot research for small autonomous robots In projects such as VEX Robotics Robocup and FIRST Robotics many robots use these wheels to have the ability to move in all directions Omni wheels are also sometimes employed as powered casters for differential drive robots to make turning faster Omniwheels are often used to allow for movement on the horizontal axis on a drivetrain as well as forward and backward movement Usually this is achieved is by using an Hdrive

Omniwheels combined with conventional wheels provide unique performance properties such as on a sixwheeled vehicle employing two conventional wheels on a center axle and four omniwheels on front and rear axles

The wheel was first patented in 1919 by J Grabowiecki

A variant of the wheel was patented by Josef F Blumrich in 1972

Blumrich claimed that the design is described in the Book of Ezekiel as a component of a spacecraft created by extraterrestrial life which is why the wheel is sometimes jokingly called the Ezekiel wheel The Spaceships of Ezekiel describes his thought provoking process for the discovery and recreation of the Omni wheel as well as a traveling craft and its docking station

A recent invention is the socalled Liddiard Wheel which claims to be a superior omnidirectional wheel

Henry Kimball Hadley
Henry Kimball Hadley 20 December 1871  6 September 1937 was an American composer and conductor

Hadley was born in Somerville Massachusetts to a musical family His father from whom he received his first musical instruction in violin and piano was a secondary school music teacher his mother was active in church music and his brother Arthur went on to a successful career as a professional cellist In the Hadley home the two brothers played string quartets with their father on viola and the composer Henry Gilbert on second violin

Hadley also studied harmony with his father and with Stephen Emery and from the age of fourteen he studied composition with the prominent American composer George Whitefield Chadwick Under Chadwicks tutelage Hadley composed many works including songs chamber music a musical and an orchestral overture

In 1893 Hadley toured with the Laura SchirmerMapleson Opera Company as a violinist But he left the tour when the company encountered financial difficulties and was unable to pay his salary

In 1894 he travelled to Vienna to further his studies with Eusebius Mandyczewski Hadley loved the artistic atmosphere of the city where he could attend countless concerts and operas and where he occasionally saw Brahms in the cafes He heard Tchaikovskys Sixth Symphony while there and it made a strong impact on him During this period Hadley also befriended the GermanAmerican conductor Adolf Neuendorff who gave him advice regarding his compositions

He returned to the United States in 1896 and took a position as the musical instructor at St Pauls Episcopal School for Boys in Garden City New York where he worked until 1902 He wrote some of his important early compositions during his time there including his overture In Bohemia and his first and second symphonies He also found prominent conductors to perform them such as Walter Damrosch Victor Herbert John Philip Sousa and Anton Seidl Hadley made his own debut as a conductor on 16 January 1900 at the WaldorfAstoria hotel leading a program mostly made up of his own works

In an age when American orchestras preferred European conductors to home grown ones Hadley felt that he needed to establish himself in Europe So he returned to Europe in 1904 to tour compose and study with Ludwig Thuille in Munich It is possible that his studies with Thuille were suggested by Richard Strauss whom Hadley met shortly after arriving in Europe Hadley composed his symphonic poem Salome in 1905 not realizing that Strauss whom he greatly admired was working on an opera on the same subject The work was eventually performed in at least 19 European cities and he was invited to conduct it along with his newly finished third symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1907 In the same year he obtained a position as an assistant conductor at the opera house in Mainz In April 1909 his first opera Safi premiered in Mainz under his baton

Later that year he returned to the United States to take a position as conductor of the Seattle Symphony In 1911 he became the first conductor of the San Francisco Symphony Hadley encountered some difficulties in San Francisco where he tried to turn a group of theater musicians into a first rate orchestra He brought a number of excellent musicians from the east including his brother Arthur to be principals in the new orchestra but this created some resentments among the locals Nonetheless by his departure in 1915 the orchestra had made great strides

Hadley returned to New York in 1915 where he made many appearances as a guest conductor and premiered many of his best known works In 1918 he married the lyric soprano Inez Barbour who thereafter sang many of her husbands works Between 1917 and 1920 three of Hadleys operas received highprofile premieres including Cleopatras Night which bowed at the Metropolitan Opera on 31 January 1920 Hadley conducted some of the performances becoming the first American composer to conduct his own opera at the Met and the opera was revived the following season Several critics judged it the best among the ten American operas to appear at the Met to that point

In 1921 Hadley was invited to become the associate conductor of the New York Philharmonic the first American conductor to hold a fulltime post with a major American orchestra During his years there his conducting received excellent reviews As well as occasionally taking the helm for regular Philharmonic concerts Hadley was assigned to lead stadium concerts during the summer where he selected many works by American composers He was eventually asked to regularly select American works for the Philharmonic to perform He remained in this post until 1927 when he resigned

In that same year Hadley was invited to conduct the first half of the season of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Buenos Aires the first American to conduct the orchestra the second half was conducted by legendary Clemens Krauss

In 1929 Hadley was invited to become the conductor of the newly formed Manhattan Symphony Orchestra He led the orchestra for three seasons including an American work in every concert He then stepped down due to his frustrations with fundraising for the orchestra in the wake of the stock market crash

In 1930 was invited to conduct six concerts with the New Symphony Orchestra of Tokyo His visit to Asia was met with great enthusiasm and he composed a new orchestral suite Streets of Pekin inspired by a side trip to China and led its world premiere with the Japanese orchestra

Henry Hadley was one of the most performed and published American composers of his day He considered himself first and foremost an orchestral composer to which his many overtures symphonic poems orchestral suites and symphonies attest He also wrote brief concertos for both cello his  and piano his Concertino Op 131

Yet he also wrote a large number of stage works including several operettas and musicals along with his five operas Though his operas Azora and Cleopatras Night received the most attention his comedy Bianca which won a prize offered by the American Society of Singers for the best chamber opera in English perhaps due to its modest demands received a number of performances during Hadleys lifetime and a few afterwards even in Japan in the early 1950s

During his years in San Francisco Hadley made friends among the citys elite which led him to become a member of the exclusive Bohemian Club for which he wrote three music dramas designed to be given a single performance outdoors at the Bohemian Grove in Northern California These works were very similar to operas but also contained some spoken dialogue Hadley later adapted music from these works to be performed as orchestral suites

He also wrote a number of chamber works although he had no compelling desire to compose it He produced a violin sonata two string quartets and two piano trios According to Tawa his most noteworthy chamber effort was the quintet in a minor for piano and strings Op 50 written in 1919

Hadley also wrote a large number of cantatas and oratorios some of them such as Resurgam conceived on a very large scale His work as a song composer is also noteworthy Villamil claims that Of his nearly 200 songs many can still be recommended for their unaffected buoyant lyricism She praises their supple vocal lines that are sensitive to poetic concerns and accompaniments that can be inventive and provocative One of his choruses from The New Earth titled Song of the Marching Men has been recorded 

Hadley was also a pioneer in film music He was invited by Warner Bros to conduct The New York Philharmonic for the soundtrack music for its 1926 film Don Juan with John Barrymore this was the first feature film with synchronized music and sound effects He was also filmed with the New York Philharmonic conducting the overture to Wagners opera Tannhuser He wrote a complete original score for the 1927 Barrymore film When a Man Loves

In 1933 Hadley founded the National Association for American Composers and Conductors which exists to this day In spite of a cancer diagnosis in 1932 he decided to pursue his dream of establishing a summer classical music festival

In the Spring of 1934 Hadley scouted the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts for a site and support for his seasonal music festival The regions well known Gilded Age summer colony had not entirely faded in spite of the Great Depression Hadleys inquiries led to the formidable and cultured Gertrude Robinson Smith Within a few months they staged three days of concerts in August with Hadley conducting sixtyfive members of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra The first concert on August 23 was under the stars before an audience of 3000 including Mrs James Roosevelt the Presidents mother For two more summers Hadley and Smith worked to achieve their vision of an permanent seasonal music festival Initially known as the Berkshire Symphonic Music Festival it soon became known as Tanglewood

Hadleys cancer surgery was initially successful and he continued his career as a composer and guest conductor However his popularity as a composer began to wane as popular and especially critical opinion turned against the robust romanticism which Hadleys music embodied The quick success of the Berkshire Philharmonic Festivals first three seasons was a dream fulfilled at the end of his life Hadleys cancer recurred and he died in New York City on September 6 1937

During his lifetime he was awarded several honors an honorary doctorate from Tufts University in 1925 membership in the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Order of Merit from the French government

The majority of Hadleys personal papers and scores are housed in the Music Division of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts During his lifetime Hadleys music was immensely popular and was a regular part of the repertory of Americas top orchestras and was also performed in Europe Many legendary conductors performed his music including Gustav Mahler Leopold Stokowski Serge Koussevitzky and Karl Muck In recent years his music has been largely neglected although a few recordings of his music have been issued An enduring aspect of his legacy is Tanglewood the realization of his dream to create a classical summer music festival

The State of World Liberty Index was a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms that their citizens enjoy It was a compilation of several similar indices created by other organizations The indexs original author Nick Wilson defined freedom as the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same 

Only one report the 2006 State of World Liberty Index released 12 August 2006 was produced by the State of World Liberty Project and the original website is now defunct However Patrick Rhamey professor in the Department of International Studies at the Virginia Military Institute  has updated the rankings through 2019 using the same concept with some adjustments to the original method 

The index has been cited by human rights organisations governments prodemocracy groups news organisations and others

The 2006 State of World Liberty Index was created by combining the rankings of four other indexes of world liberty into one the 2005 Economic Freedom of the World Index Fraser Institute the 2006 Index of Economic Freedom The Heritage Foundation the 2005 Freedom in the World index Freedom House and the 2005 Press Freedom Index Reporters Without Borders 

These reports are used to score countries in three categories individual freedom economic freedom and government size and taxation These three scores are then averaged to give a countrys overall score

The 20122019 Rankings reproduce the original ranking concept using the same data sources albeit adjusting the weighting of data to best capture the original intent of measuring the ability of the individual to live their lives as they choose Measures are also standardized appropriately given the different scales used across indices and the government burden category was condensed into the broader indicator of economic freedom

Beginning in 2018 the ranking also includes a measure of how Conservative or Progressive a state defined as whether a state regulates either social or economic issues more heavily

In the 2019 index New Zealand is ranked most free overall while North Korea is last Hong Kong was ranked most free in economic liberty while Norway was ranked most free in the social liberty category
