Archer typeface
Archer is a slab serif typeface designed in 2001 by Tobias FrereJones and Jonathan Hoefler for use in Martha Stewart Living magazine It was later released by Hoefler  FrereJones for commercial licensing

The typeface is a geometric slab serif one with a geometric design similar to sansserif fonts It takes inspiration from midtwentieth century designs such as Rockwell

The face is unique for combining the geometric structure of twentiethcentury European slabserifs but imbuing the face with a domestic less strident tone of voice Balls were added to the upper terminals on letters such as C and G to increase its charm Italics are true italic designs with flourishes influenced by calligraphy an unusual feature for geometric slab serif designs As with many Hoefler  FrereJones designs it was released in a wide range of weights from hairline to bold reflecting its design goal as a typeface for complex magazines

The typeface has been used for among other things branding for Wells Fargo and is a main font for the San Francisco Chronicle and Wes Andersons film The Grand Budapest Hotel It is also the current font used for titles and body text by the Design Observer website

Swiss chalet style
Swiss chalet style   is an architectural style of Late Historicism originally inspired by rural chalets in Switzerland and the Alpine mountainous regions of Central Europe The style refers to traditional building designs characterised by widely projecting roofs and facades richly decorated with wooden balconies and carved ornaments It spread over Germany AustriaHungary and Scandinavia during the Belle poque era

Swiss chalet style originated in the Romantic era of the late18thearly19th century when the ideas of the English landscape garden inspired parks and residences in Germany such as the DessauWrlitz Garden Realm It became highly appreciated on the continent by noble landowners who were impressed by the simple life of people living in the mountains 

The chalet style soon spread over the German Mittelgebirge landscapes such as the Harz mountains or the Dresden area and the adjacent North Bohemian region As a modern building style it also influenced the resort architecture along the Baltic seaside like in Binz or Heringsdorf Around 1900 design elements were used in the construction of numerous bourgeois family homes as well as by notable architects like Heinrich von Ferstel to build larger mansions and hotels 

The style was further popularized by the first waves of tourism of rich people from the North and West of Europe and became popular in other parts of Europe and North America notably in the architecture of Norway Iceland and the Netherlands and in the country house architecture of Sweden and Cincinnati Ohio USA in the late 19th and early 20th century English examples of the chalet style include the Boathouse at Belton House Lincolnshire by Anthony Salvin and the Swiss Cottage at Osbourne House on the Isle of Wight constructed for Queen Victorias children

Joseph Eubanks born 1975 is an American professional wrestler best known by the ring name Lobo He wrestled primarily in Combat Zone Wrestling CZW where he won every major championship and was the first inductee into the CZW Hall of Fame in 2004 He was formerly the CZW CommissionerTalent Coordinator

Along with Nick Gage Justice Pain and Ric Blade Lobo was trained by John Zandig at the CZW Wrestling School and graduated first in the class He became one of the main wrestlers in CZW along with other graduates from the school In February 1999 Lobo became the second Iron Man Champion He held the title until June when he lost it to Justice Pain These two continued wrestling each other and competed in the first ever Cage of Death match at the first Cage of Death show Lobo won the match and regained the title He would lose this title to Wifebeater but regain it one more time the following year

Lobo also challenged for the CZW Heavyweight Championship He feuded with Zandig for the title and finally beat him in July 2000 He held the title until Cage of Death II At that show Lobo successfully defended the championship against Zandig in the Cage of Death match Directly following this match Justice Pain came out and fought Lobo in another Cage of Death match In the match Lobo was thrown from the top of the cage to the ground through a table covered in barbed wire Justice Pain went on to win the match and the title After losing the title Lobo continued feuding with Zandig This time the feud was for ownership of CZW On February 9 2002 Lobo defeated Zandig to become the new owner of CZW He held this position until Cage of Death IV when Zandig defeated him to regain his position as CZWs owner 

He took some time off from CZW following the Cage of Death match While he was gone a new group called the HiV tried to take over CZW with Zandig as their main target Zandig was planning to face the HiV at Cage of Death V but the stable outnumbered his team 6 to 4 At Night of Infamy II
Lobo made a shocking return to help Zandig and join his team just in time for Cage of Death Their team was successful In February 2004 Lobo became the first inductee to the CZW Hall of Fame After this Lobo remained inactive for the following two years

At Cage of Death 7 Zandig who had turned on the fans wanted to run CZW the way they used to He called out Lobo who was backstage for the event and they joined each other along with Justice Pain and Nick Gage They would later call themselves the Forefathers of CZW

Antisubmarine missile
An antisubmarine missile is a standoff antisubmarine weapon Often a variant of antiship missile designs an antisubmarine systems typically use a jet or rocket engine to deliver an explosive warhead aimed directly at a submarine a depth charge or a homing torpedo that is carried from a launch ship or other platform to the vicinity of a target

Depth charges were the earliest weapons designed for use by ships against submerged submarines These explosives were initially dropped as the ship moved over the presumed location of a submarine Before World War II shipboard sonar was unable to maintain contact with a submarine at close range

Various mortartype projectors including Hedgehog and Squid were devised during World War II to allow a ship to maintain sonar contact while lobbing explosive charges toward the submarine

During the Cold War missiles were developed to provide greater range with reduced recoil Some missiles and rockets such as Hong Sang Eo carry homing torpedoes to provide terminal guidance for the warhead

The advantage of an antisubmarine missile is the attack standoff range The Swedish Bofors 375mm m50 AntiSubmarine Warfare ASW rockets in the past commonly used by Sweden France Japan and Germany for instance can travel as far as 3600m depending on the rocket used The USSR developed its own antisubmarine rockets in the RBU series and these are still in use in Russia and in countries using Russian designed ships Today antisubmarine rockets have been phased out in most western navies replaced by the Homing ASW Torpedo

Northern river shark
The northern river shark or New Guinea river shark Glyphis garricki is a species of requiem shark in the family Carcharhinidae found in scattered tidal rivers and associated coastal waters in northern Australia and in Papua New Guinea This species inhabits areas with poor visibility soft bottoms and large tides with immature sharks ranging into fresh and brackish water It is similar to other river sharks in having a stocky grey body with a high back tiny eyes and broad fins It measures up to long

Northern river sharks are likely piscivorous This species is viviparous with females bearing litters of 9 young possibly every other year before the wet season Very rare and facing threats from commercial and recreational fishing and perhaps also habitat degradation this species has been assessed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature

The first known specimens of the northern river shark two newborn males from Papua New Guinea were discovered by New Zealand ichthyologist Jack Garrick after whom the species was eventually named This shark was referred to as Glyphis sp C until 2008 when it was formally described by Leonard Compagno William White and Peter R Last in a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation paper The type specimen is a female long collected from the East Alligator River Kakadu National Park Northern Territory

The northern river shark has been reported from King Sound the Ord River and Doctors Creek near Derby Western Australia the Adelaide and Alligator Rivers in Australias Northern Territory and the Daru region and possibly the Fly River in Papua New Guinea It inhabits large rivers estuaries and coastal bays all of which are characterized by high turbidity silty or muddy bottoms and large tides Young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh brackish and salt water salinity ranging from 2 to 36 ppt whereas adults have only been found in marine environments

Like other members of its genus the northern river shark has a stocky body with a high back The head is wide and flattened with a broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with nictitating membranes Each nostril is divided into a very large incurrent opening and a small excurrent opening by a triangular skin flap The sizable mouth is broadly arched with short furrows at the corners Thirtyone to 34 tooth rows are in the upper jaw and 3035 tooth rows are in the lower jaw the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved In the largest individuals the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spearshaped with serrations near the tip

The pectoral fins are large and broad with gently backwardcurving margins and pointed tips The pelvic fins are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins The first dorsal fin is longbased and triangular with the apex almost forming a right angle the second dorsal fin is some twothirds as high as the first The origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips No ridge exists between the dorsal fins The anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has a strong notch in the rear margin The caudal fin has a strong lower lobe and a long narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip The dermal denticles are small oval and overlapping bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth This shark is steelgray above and white below the color transition is sharp located well below the eye and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk The anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips The maximum known length is  This species differs from the speartooth shark G glyphis in several morphological and meristic characters including having fewer vertebrae 137151 versus 213222 and a lower jagged graywhite color boundary

With its slender teeth small eyes and high density of ampullae of Lorenzini the northern river shark seems to be adapted for hunting fish in conditions of poor visibility In Doctors Creek sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide Like other requiem sharks this species is viviparous with the developing embryos forming a placental connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of yolk Females give birth around October before the start of the wet season on possibly a biennial cycle One female examined contained nine fetuses The young are born at under long males mature between lengths of  while females mature between lengths of 

The northern river shark appears to be extremely rare though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in Australia and Papua New Guinea Based on present information no more than 250 mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild with no more than 50 in any particular subpopulation This species is caught legally and illegally by commercial fisheries using longlines and gillnets as well as by recreational fishers habitat degradation may pose a further threat to its survival Because of its low natural abundance limited distribution stringent habitat requirements and susceptibility to various humancaused threats the IUCN has assessed the northern river shark as critically endangered It has also been listed as endangered on the 1999 Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and on the 2000 Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act Kakadu National Park may be an important protected area for this species No regulations restrict the capture of this species in Papua New Guinea

United Church The Chapel on the Hill
The United Church Chapel on the Hill in Oak Ridge Tennessee was the citys main church during World War II Dedicated on September 30 1943 and completed late in October 1943 it was originally a multidenominational chapel shared by Catholic Protestant and Jewish congregations

The building design is a US Army Corps of Engineers 700series US Army chapel It is a frame building built on a threebay rectangular plan with a steepled bell tower and a gable entry porch It was one of three Army chapels built using the same design in Oak Ridge during World War II One of the other two chapels the West Chapel in the citys West Village area was later torn down but the East Chapel in the East Village is still in use

The US Army built the chapel to house religious activities as one of numerous community facilities in the townsite area of Oak Ridge The building was dedicated on September 30 1943 in a ceremony that included prayers and talks by a Jewish rabbi a Catholic priest an Episcopal priest a Baptist minister and the minister who was serving the United Church congregation that eventually came to own the chapel Its name The Chapel on the Hill comes from a reference in a prayer by the Knoxville Baptist minister who participated in the dedication

The United Church congregation that is housed in the Chapel on the Hill traces its history to July 18 1943 when some 25 to 30 Christians of diverse denominational backgrounds gathered for Sunday worship in Oak Ridges main cafeteria Subsequently several members of the group made plans to establish an interdenominational Protestant church led by laypersons to include all denominations A Presbyterian minister working in Knoxville was engaged to conduct weekly services and about 150 people representing 13 Protestant denominations became charter members of the United Church Governing boards of laypersons elected to lead the new congregation took up their duties on October 24 1943

When the ChapelontheHill was completed that same month the United Church and the local Roman Catholic Church were given control of the building as the only two churches then officially operating in the Manhattan Project community During the war when Oak Ridges Manhattan Project facilities were operating around the clock the chapel building was also in use nearly 24 hours a day as a venue for worship services weddings and other occasions for local workers of various Protestant Catholic and Jewish religious backgrounds

At the peak of wartime activity in Oak Ridge when the population exceeded 70000 the United Church employed four ministers and conducted worship services in the Chapel on the Hill East Village Chapel and the Jefferson Theater as well as Sunday school classes in several local schools and a trailer camp By 1951 the United Church ChapelontheHill consolidated as a single interdenominational congregation making its home in the Chapel on the Hill building

The United Church congregation purchased the chapel and of land from the US Atomic Energy Commission on May 11 1955 for a price of 17116 An adjoining educational building was added in 19561957 The facility continues to operate as a nondenominational Protestant church under lay leadership employing ministers with backgrounds in mainstream Protestant denominations Since 2007 it has been affiliated with the Center for Progressive Christianity The churchs motto is Where People from All Denominations Meet in Their Differences but Are One in Their Search for God

The ChapelontheHill was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 as a contributing property in the Oak Ridge Historic District

Open data
Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish without restrictions from copyright patents or other mechanisms of control The goals of the opensource data movement are similar to those of other opensource movements such as opensource software hardware open content open education open educational resources open government open knowledge open access open science and the open web Paradoxically the growth of the open data movement is paralleled by a rise in intellectual property rights The philosophy behind open data has been long established for example in the Mertonian tradition of science but the term open data itself is recent gaining popularity with the rise of the Internet and World Wide Web and especially with the launch of opendata government initiatives such as Datagov Datagovuk and Datagovin

Open data can also be linked data when it is it is linked open data One of the most important forms of open data is open government data OGD which is a form of open data created by ruling government institutions Open government datas importance is borne from it being a part of citizens everyday lives down to the most routinemundane tasks that are seemingly far removed from government

The concept of open data is not new but a formalized definition is  One definition is the Open Definition which can be summarized in the statement that A piece of data is open if anyone is free to use reuse and redistribute it  subject only at most to the requirement to attribute andor sharealike Other definitions including the Open Data Institutes Open data is data that anyone can access use or share have an accessible short version of the definition but refer to the formal definition

Open data may include nontextual material such as maps genomes connectomes chemical compounds mathematical and scientific formulae medical data and practice bioscience and biodiversity Problems often arise because these are commercially valuable or can be aggregated into works of value Access to or reuse of the data is controlled by organisations both public and private Control may be through access restrictions licenses copyright patents and charges for access or reuse Advocates of open data argue that these restrictions are against the common good and that these data should be made available without restriction or fee In addition it is important that the data are reusable without requiring further permission though the types of reuse such as the creation of derivative works may be controlled by a license

A typical depiction of the need for open data

Creators of data often do not consider the need to state the conditions of ownership licensing and reuse instead presuming that not asserting copyright puts the data into the public domain For example many scientists do not regard the published data arising from their work to be theirs to control and consider the act of publication in a journal to be an implicit release of data into the commons However the lack of a license makes it difficult to determine the status of a data set and may restrict the use of data offered in an Open spirit Because of this uncertainty it is also possible for public or private organizations to aggregate said data protect it with copyright and then resell it

The issue of indigenous knowledge IK poses a great challenge in terms of capturing storage and distribution Many societies in thirdworld countries lack the technicality processes of managing the IK

At his presentation at the XML 2005 conference Connolly displayed these two quotations regarding open data

Open data can come from any source This section lists some of the fields that publish or at least discuss publishing a large amount of open data

The concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the World Data Center system in preparation for the International Geophysical Year of 19571958 The International Council of Scientific Unions now the International Council for Science oversees several World Data Centres with the mandate to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility

While the opensciencedata movement long predates the Internet the availability of fast ubiquitous networking has significantly changed the context of Open science data since publishing or obtaining data has become much less expensive and timeconsuming

The Human Genome Project was a major initiative that exemplified the power of open data It was built upon the socalled Bermuda Principles stipulating that All human genomic sequence information  should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society More recent initiatives such as the Structural Genomics Consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial RD

In 2004 the Science Ministers of all nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD which includes most developed countries of the world signed a declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available Following a request and an intense discussion with dataproducing institutions in member states the OECD published in 2007 the OECD Principles and Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding as a softlaw recommendation

Examples of open data in science

There are a range of different arguments for government open data For example some advocates contend that making government information available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate government transparency accountability and public participation Open data can be a powerful force for public accountabilityit can make existing information easier to analyze process and combine than ever before allowing a new level of public scrutiny Governments that enable public viewing of data can help citizens engage within the governmental sectors and add value to that data 

Some make the case that opening up official information can support technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties to develop new kinds of digital applications and services

Several national governments have created websites to distribute a portion of the data they collect It is a concept for a collaborative project in municipal Government to create and organize culture for Open Data or Open government data

Additionally other levels of government have established open data websites There are many government entities pursuing Open Data in Canada Datagov lists the sites of a total of 40 US states and 46 US cities and counties with websites to provide open data eg the state of Maryland the state of California US

At the international level the United Nations has an open data website that publishes statistical data from member states and UN agencies and the World Bank published a range of statistical data relating to developing countries The European Commission has created two portals for the European Union the EU Open Data Portal which gives access to open data from the EU institutions agencies and other bodies and the PublicData portal that provides datasets from local regional and national public bodies across Europe

In October 2015 the Open Government Partnership launched the International Open Data Charter a set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data formally adopted by seventeen governments of countries states and cities during the OGP Global Summit in Mexico

The debate on open data is still evolving The best open government applications seek to empower citizens to help small businesses or to create value in some other positive constructive way Opening government data is only a waypoint on the road to improving education improving government and building tools to solve other real world problems While many arguments have been made categorically the following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its potential uses

Arguments made on behalf of open data include the following


It is generally held that factual data cannot be copyrighted However publishers frequently add copyright statements often forbidding reuse to scientific data accompanying publications It may be unclear whether the factual data embedded in full text are part of the copyright

While the human abstraction of facts from paper publications is normally accepted as legal there is often an implied restriction on the machine extraction by robots

Unlike open access where groups of publishers have stated their concerns open data is normally challenged by individual institutions Their arguments have been discussed less in public discourse and there are fewer quotes to rely on at this time

Arguments against making all data available as open data include the following


The goals of the Open Data movement are similar to those of other Open movements


Several funding bodies which mandate Open Access also mandate Open Data A good expression of requirements truncated in places is given by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research CIHR


Other bodies active in promoting the deposition of data as well as fulltext include the Wellcome Trust An academic paper published in 2013 advocated that Horizon 2020 the science funding mechanism of the EU due to launch in 2014 should mandate that funded projects hand in their databases as deliverables at the end of the project so that they can be checked for third party usability then shared

Several mechanisms restrict access to or reuse of data and several reasons for doing this are given above They include

Daniel Roxo was born in Mogadouro TrsosMontes on 1 February 1933 As a young man he immigrated to Niassa Province in 1951 where he settled as a professional hunter and safari guide When the Mozambican War of Independence broke out in 1964 Roxo formed his African trackers servants and European acquaintances into a private militia hunting FRELIMO combatants for government bounties

Disillusioned by Portugals promise to hand Mozambique to Samora Machels incoming government Roxo supported an abortive coup dtat by antiFRELIMO forces in Loureno Marques on September 7 1974 He went into exile in South Africa the following November joining the South African Defence Force After completing Special Forces selection Danny was seconded to Bravo Group later 32 Battalion

Roxo was awarded the Honoris Crux for bravery during Operation Savannah for an action during the Battle of Bridge 14 at  an engagement during which he singlehandedly killed eleven enemy soldiers

Bridge 14 was situated on the Nhia River en route from Cela to Quibala South African mechanized contingents deploying to the south had routed a unit of the Peoples Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola FAPLA some time prior and the retreating Angolans had demolished the existing structure However since Colonel Jan Breytenbach could not ascertain this from his forward positions he ordered Roxo to conduct a more thorough reconnaissance Roxo arrived at the river with four Eland90 armoured cars his patrol came under heavy mortar fire from an opposite bank and two of the vehicles withdrew leaving Roxos platoon to retire on foot Having scouted the bridge alone and determined it was no longer intact he inadvertently walked into an FAPLA ambush but he managed to dispatch his attackers Two escaped South African prisoners later claimed that aside from the Angolan casualties four Cuban troops were reported killed in the encounter

During a patrol near the Okavango river his personnel carrier struck a landmine and overturned killing one man and crushing Roxo beneath it The rest of the vehicles crew tried to lift it free but it was too heavy Breytenbach wrote

Dayfine
A dayfine day fine unit fine or structured fine is a unit of fine payment that above a minimum fine is based on the offenders daily personal income A crime is punished with incarceration for a determined number of days or with fines As incarceration is a financial punishment in the effect of preventing work a dayfine represents one day incarcerated and without salary It is argued to be just because if both highincome and lowincome population are punished with the same jail time they should also be punished with a proportionally similar income loss An analogy may be drawn with income tax which is also proportional to the income even progressively

Jurisdictions employing the dayfine include Finland  Estonia  Sweden  Denmark  Germany  France  Switzerland and Macao

Unit fine systems are common and standard in many jurisdictions across the world notably in FennoScandinavia where it originated in 1921 in Finland and in Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand

In Finland the dayfine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of a fine The system has been in use since 1921 Most minor infractions are punished with a fixed petty fine rikesakko ordningsbot such as minor traffic and water traffic violations
littering and breaches of public peace
A petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt but the person punished may contest the fine in a district court
Most infractions are punishable with a dayfine For crimes warranting no more than six months in prison the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case The process of ordering a day fine is started by a police officer who makes a formal demand for the suspect to be fined The suspect has one week to contest the demand If the suspect does not contest the demand the prosecutor may order a fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer If the suspect contests the demand the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty If the prosecutor considers the case to merit a term in prison or a higher fine the case is always taken to the court If the prosecution or the injured party do not demand a higher punishment than a fine the district court has a quorum with a single member The fine is paid to the bank using a giro A fine ordered in Finland is executable in any European Union member country

A Finnish fine consists of a minimum of 1 dayfine up to a maximum of 120 dayfines If several crimes are punished together 240 dayfines may be sentenced The fines may not be sentenced together with a prison sentence unless the prison sentence is probational The minimum amount of a dayfine is 6 euros Usually the dayfine is one half of daily disposable income The daily disposable income is considered to be one 60th part of the persons monthly mean income during the year after taxes social security payments and a basic living allowance of 255 per month have been deducted In addition every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by 3 The income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data For speeding in traffic however the fine is at least as high as the petty fine ie 115

The person who is punished with a fine is responsible for giving accurate information concerning their income Lying about ones income   is a crime punishable with a fine or up to three months in prison The police can however access the taxation data of Finnish citizens and permanent residents via a realtime datalink so the chance of lying successfully is minor There is no maximum dayfine which may lead to considerably high fines for highincome persons For example in 2001 a Finnish businessman with a yearly income of 10 million euros received a relatively mild punishment of six dayfines amounting 26000 for driving though a red traffic light In 2009 a businessman was fined 112000 for travelling at 82 kilometres per hour in an area with a speed limit of 60 kilometres per hour As speeding is punished with a petty fine if the offender is exceeding the speed limit by up to 20kmh but with a dayfine if exceeding the limit by 21kmh or more the monetary amount of the fine can increase from 115 to over 100000 although the actual change in speed is less than 1kmh This has given rise to some criticism most vividly expressed by a Finnish member of parliament avid motorist Klaus Bremer and other MPs of rightwing parties

The fines are subject to recovery proceedings If the fines are still not paid the court may convert them to a prison sentence Three dayfines will be converted to one day of imprisonment ignoring the remainder for any amount of dayfines not divisible by three and the length of the sentence must be between 4 and 60 days This conversion punishment   is only ever applied to courtordered fines not those issued by police

Day fines are a concept to which little thought has been given in India Undeniably prisons are overcrowded and disproportionately represent religious minorities and socioeconomically vulnerable castes and tribal groups It is however unclear how much of this is due to fines The IPC provides some safeguards on imposing fines such as monetary caps on fines for some offences and stringent limits for imprisonment for nonpayment of fines Where no upper monetary caps are specified the IPC does not gives courts discretion to impose fines which are unlimited but not excessive While specific fine amounts would require to be done away with in the text of the IPC several underlying actions would need to be done before pressing day fines into service 
Article 45 of the Penal Code  Portuguese  specifies that a criminal fine  Portuguese  shall normally be at least 10 days and at most 360 days One dayfine costs at least 50 Macanese patacas and at most 10000 patacas A court of law imposes the fine based on the economic and financial situations and personal burdens of a convict

England and Wales experimented with the system for a short period from 1992 to 1993 It was unpopular with both magistrates and the general public and was soon abandoned The scheme was replaced by requirements that magistrates consider an offenders means when imposing a fine just not according to a mathematical formula

The New York Times reported on an experience with day fines which took place in 1988 in Staten Island which was a partnership between the local courts and District Attorney and the Vera Institute of Justice

Aeronautica Imperialis
Aeronautica Imperialis is a tabletop miniature wargame set within the Warhammer 40000 universe The game focuses on aerial combat between the different races of the Warhammer 40000 universe Released in January 2007 it was developed and published by Forge World a division of the British gaming company Games Workshop

Aeronautica Imperialis is a companion game to Epic which emphasises battles between armies on a larger scale than Warhammer 40000

Gameplaywise the major difference between Epic and Aeronautica Imperialis is that instead of a player moving and firing tanks and troops they are using aircraft and ground defense weapons

The Aeronautica Imperialis rulebook contains not only rules for the games but also two sheets of cards which are used to make special manoeuvres Other content in the rulebook is background material on the individual aircraft along with full colour plates and suggestions for painting At the end of the book there is a campaign section with scenarios for players to recreate

It makes use of currently available aircraft models designed for Epic which are approximately 6mm scale or 1285 Forge Worlds say that Epic models are 5 times smaller than their Warhammer 40000 equivalent In addition to the use of the miniatures Forge World also sells special bases for the game to indicate such things as the altitude speed and fire arcs of each aeroplane

The currently supported races or factions are the Imperial Navy Space Marines Eldar Tau Chaos and Orks

Aeronautica Imperialis has a strong tie with the Black Library book Double Eagle by Dan Abnett This deals with the air war occurring during the Sabbat Worlds Campaign the setting for Abnetts Gaunts Ghosts novel series It has a Battle of Britain flavour many of the concepts elucidated in the Aeronautica rules can be seen in Abnetts writing

In late 2007 Forge World released Tactica Aeronautica a collection of extra rules new aircraft and scenarios for the game

Greek destroyer Ierax 1912
Ierax   Hawk was an which had been built for Argentina as Santa Fe She served in the Hellenic Royal Navy from 1912 to 1946

Four sister ships  Ierax and  had originally been ordered as the San Luis class by Argentina from the English shipyard Cammell Laird in Birkenhead The second was completed as Santa Fe They were purchased in 1912 by Greece ready for delivery each for the sum of 148000 when the Balkan Wars seemed likely Ierax was accepted by Captain Ath Miaoulis RHN in Palermo Sicily where she arrived manned by a foreign crew

During the Balkan Wars the Royal Hellenic Navy purchased only the minimum amount of ammunition 3000 rounds of torpedoes Torpedoes were not available for this class of ship and for this reason these ships were initially named scouts rather than destroyers On October 21 1912 under the command of Commander A Vratsanos RHN Ierax was part of the Greek flotilla that captured the island of Psara from the Ottomans

During World War I Greece belatedly entered the war on the side of the Triple Entente and due to Greeces neutrality the four Aetosclass ships were seized by the Allies in October 1916 taken over by the French in November and served in the French Navy from 191718 By 1918 they were back on escort duty under Greek colors mainly in the Aegean Sea

Ierax participated in the evacuation of Greeks from Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1918 and saw action in the GrecoTurkish War 19191922 in the Sea of Marmara and the Aegean Sea

After the war Ierax was refurbished from 19251927 She also participated in the Second World War after surviving the German invasion of April 1941 Ierax was based in Alexandria Egypt In April 1944 a wave of mutiny swept through some of the Hellenic Royal Navy with seamen agitating in favor of the proCommunist guerrillas ELAS who were fighting a campaign in Greece against the occupying Nazis Ierax was one of the ships whose crew mutinied and the mutiny was put down in the early morning hours of 22 April 1944

After the end of World War II Ierax was stricken decommissioned in 1946

Dental caries nonhuman
Dental caries also known as tooth decay is uncommon among companion animals The bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis cause dental caries by metabolising sugars

The term feline cavities is commonly used to refer to feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions however sacchrolytic acidproducing bacteria the same responsible for Dental plaque are not involved in this condition

Although rarely seen in cats the incidence of caries in dogs has been estimated at approximately 5 Dogs are less likely than humans to have tooth decay due to the very high pH of dog saliva which prevents an acidic environment from forming and the subsequent demineralization of enamel which would occur In the event that tooth decay does occur usually from trauma dogs can receive dental fillings just as humans do

Altheides
Altheides 11931262 was a Cypriot philosopher primarily known from sayings attributed to him in the works of others Little is known about the wandering philosopher known as Altheides of Cyprus and little of his work remains available to modern scholars His parents were Greek merchants living on the island under the rule of Guy of Lusignan He was born a year before Guys death in 1193 At some point in his late teens he left Cyprus as a seaman on a Moorish trading vessel

Altheides again turns up in historical records with the founding of his School of Philosophy in Jerusalem in 1226 under the rule of alKamil the nephew of Saladin and ruler of Jerusalem His school was never particularly successful and dispersed shortly after alKamils treaty of 1229 signing the city back over to the Crusaders From this point very little is known Scattered accounts and writings appear here and there in as varied locations as Spain Morocco Rome and Egypt Altheides died near his childhood home on Cyprus in 1262

Altheides never wrote a serious philosophical work or treatise and is primarily known for his many wise sayings primarily found in other works written in the early thirteenth century

We are running towards a precipice we can but hope that when we reach the edge we shall be able to fly Of education and training Jerusalem 1227

Soviet offensives into the Panjshir Valley had three main tactical features There was 1 the concentration of air assets including extensive aerial bombardment of a target area followed by 2 the landing of helicopter forces to stop the withdrawal of enemy forces and engage the enemy from unexpected directions and 3 a drive by of mechanized forces into areas of guerrilla support in conjunction with the helicopter landing parties It was these kinds of tactics that caused so much destruction in the civilian populations in these regions By forcing the mass migration of civilians from the Panjshir Valley and destroying all crops and livestock the Soviets hoped to deprive Ahmad Shah Massoud of resources to sustain his fulltime fighters

This tactic had some success as in order to rebuild his organization Massoud was forced to sign a cease fire treaty in January 1983 that would last for one year The bottom line though was that these victories were temporary There were serious issues with this tactic of large punitive offensives that contributed to the stalemate that characterized the war Mujahideen forces would often learn of coming offensives in advance from their compatriots in the DRA army Not only could civilians and guerrillas move safely out of the way of the majority of the bombs but guerrillas could also plan ambushes lay mines and move weapons caches Once armored personnel carriers and helicopters came the guerrillas would retreat into the side valleys and carry out small ambushes rather than openly confront the Soviets

The first Soviet operation in Panjshir took place in April 1980 just four months after the arrival of Soviet forces in Afghanistan It involved three Soviet battalions of which one was the fourth battalion of the 56th Guards Air Assault Brigade led by Captain Leonid Khabarov and 1000 men of the Afghan army and security forces The overall commander of the operation was General Pechevoy 

The Mujahideen numbered only 1000 according to Soviet intelligence or no more than 200 according to Afghan sources They were armed only with antiquated rifles and had not constructed any defensive works but laid mines on the only road The advance proceeded up the valley capturing Bazarak after a fight and overunning Massouds headquarters in PasishahMardan where various documents were found Khabarov was injured in the fighting taking a bullet to the forearm The rebels deliberately let the SovietDRA force into the valley and ambushed them as they withdrew During the fourday operation the Soviets claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels but the Mujahideen newspaper Call of Jihad put their losses at four killed

The first operation had installed a garrison of Afghan troops in a fort in the town of Rokha but they quickly came uder siege by the Mujahideen and suffered constant losses from harassing fire Beginning on August 28 a new offensive dubbed Panjshir I was carried out by Afghan and Soviet troops It included for the first time a heliborne landing by air assault troops As before the Mujahideen did not oppose the offensive frontally but haraased and amubushed the Soviets and DRA troops as they passed The operation lasted 21 days The Mujahideen admitted to 25 killed in their own ranks but claimed to have inflicted 500 casualties on their opponents and shot down several helicopters

Despite the operation rebel pressure on Rokha including the use of captured artillery pieces did not let up On November 8 a convoy of government trucks escorted by Soviet armoured vehicles reached the besieged post Dismounted Soviet and DRA troops engaged the Mujahideen on the heights around the town in an effort to break the siege One of Massouds subcommanders was killed and the surrounding villages suffered heavily from indiscriminate bombing by Soviet aircraft but the siege continued

The final operation of 1980 began on December 12 Heavy airstrikes hit the valley causing the death of 100 civilians and 15 Mujahideen The fort at Rokha was finally evacuated on December 27 and the operation ended two days later leaving the valley mostly under rebel control

By this time Massoud had mustered enough men to openly resist the Soviet assault During this offensive to avoid losing vehicles to land mines the Soviets sent their sapper units to clear the way in front of the main force This tactic proved costly and the attack force penetrated only 25km into the valley before retiring after having suffered 100 casualties

By 1982 Massoud had built up his forces to 3000 men and other Mujahideen from neighbouring areas could come to his aid The approaches to the valley were strengthened with defensive positions established on dominant heights and near narrow passages Hollowedout caves were used as supply depots and shelters

The first major offensive was carried out by a force of 12000 Afghan and Soviet soldiers under the command of General Norat TerGrigoryants with 320 armoured vehicles 155 artillery pieces and supported by 104 helicopters and 26 airplanes The Soviet units involved were the 108th Motor Rifle Division 201st Motor Rifle Division the 103rd Guards Airborne Division who each contributed one regiment the 66th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade elements of the 860th Separate MotorRifle Regiment the 191st Separate MotorRifle Regiment and the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment The plan for the operation was prepared in secret by a small number of 40th Army officers In order to deceive the Mujahideen a diversionary attack up the Ghorband valley was planned This was presented as the real attack to the Afghan Army staff which included Mujahideen sympathizers and who then leaked the plan to the resistance 

The main assault began on the night of May 16 after an intense aviation and artillery bombardment While motorized rifle battalions preceded by reconnaissance units attacked the dominating features at the entrance of the valley airborne units were airlifted by helicopter behind the main Mujahideen defenses In all 4200 troops were airlifted into the valley to capture strategic points right up to the Pakistani border in an effort to cut the Mujahideen supply lines In some areas the fighting was intense when a Soviet paratrooper regiment landed east of Rukha it was quickly encircled and suffered significant losses The beleaguered paratroopers were saved only by the arrival of a motorised rifle battalion led by Major Aushev who forced his way through the Mujahideen defenses consisting of welllocated strong points and captured Rukha For his actions Aushev was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union

Massoud who expected an attack similar to the previous ones had disposed his defenses close to the entrance of the valley and was thus unable to prevent the Soviets from gaining footholds in the Panjshir They established three main bases at Rukha Bazarak and Anava Most of the Mujahideen had survived the attack and Massoud divided them into small mobile groups that fought the Soviets all down the valley

During this offensive the Soviets managed to occupy a large part of the Panjshir and scored some successes against Massouds organization such as the capture of a list of the names of 600 of his agents in Kabul However most of the rebels had escaped capture and this was not the decisive victory the Soviets had been hoping for Also their heavily fortified bases only gave them control over the valley floor while the surrounding heights were still held by the Mujahideen For this reason they decided to launch a sixth offensive

The sixth offensive consisted of a series of sweeps conducted by motorized units and by airborne Spetsnaz units launched from their bases in the Panjshir to find and destroy the Mujahideen hideouts It was accompanied by a heavy aerial bombardment of villages suspected of harbouring rebel groups notably carried out by Tu16 bombers flying from inside the Soviet Union Airborne Troops carried out search and destroy missions encircling Massouds mobile units and destroying some of them However as a rule attrition among the Mujahideen was low and the brunt of the attacks fell on the civilian population who suffered heavily many of them preferring to flee the valley

Despite bitter fighting the Soviets were unable to eradicate the Mujahideen and the battle soon developed into a stalemate During the 5th and 6th offensives the Soviets suffered up to 3000 casualties and 1000 Afghan Army soldiers defected to the Mujahideen

Once the height of the offensive had passed many areas captured by the Soviet forces were handed over to Afghan army units who suffered from low morale and high desertion rates They were the targets for Massouds counterattacks In a series of surprise attacks several government outposts fell to the rebels The first was the Afghan Army outpost at Saricha which the Mujahideen captured along with 80 prisoners and 8 tanks despite having to cross a minefield The government post at Birjaman fell soon after and the Mujahideen were able to recapture some areas in this way These operations along with the continued harassment of Soviet garrisons and resupply convoys proved that the Mujahideen were far from defeated and convinced the Soviets that they must negotiate a truce with Massoud

In January 1983 for the first time a ceasefire was concluded between the Soviets and the Mujahideen lasting 6 months and later extended Negotiated by Massoud in person with a colonel of the GRU Anatoly Tkachev the agreement stipulated that Soviet troops should evacuate the Panjshir except for a small garrison at Anava whose access was controlled by the Mujahideen The area covered by the ceasefire included the Panjshir valley but not the Salang pass where fighting continued

Massoud took advantage of the truce to extend his influence over areas that had until then been held by hostile factions loyal to Gulbuddin Hekmatyars Hezbiislami party like in Andarab District More peacefully he took control of the KhostFereng sector and some areas in southern Takhar Province while establishing contacts with other guerrilla groups in Baghlan Province and persuading them to adopt his military organisation He also ordered the strengthening of defenses in five subsidiary valleys as well as in the Panjshir permitting a defense in depth and withdrew his headquarters to Shira Mandara in Takhar province in anticipation of a renewed assault

In February 1984 Konstantin Chernenko replaced Yuri Andropov as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union While Andropov had supported the ceasefire Chernenko a disciple of Brezhnev believed that the guerrillas should be rooted out through military action an opinion which he shared with Babrak Karmal president of the DRA As a result a new offensive was planned which in Karmals words should be decisive and merciless and in order to destroy the Panjshir valley bases all those living there should be killed It was the largest offensive in the region to date

However some Soviets who were supporters of Andropov disagreed with this policy and they gave Massoud advance warning of the attack Through this channel and thanks to his agents in the DRA government Massoud had a precise idea of the Soviet plans and he was able to counter them To avoid civilian casualties all 30000 inhabitants of the Panjshir from a population of 100000 before the war were evacuated to safe areas Only ambush parties were left to delay the Soviet advance All the roads villages and helicopter landing zones were heavily mined All these preparations were carried out in secret and a token activity was maintained near the Soviet base at Anava to deceive the Soviets into believing that a conventional defense was being prepared

11000 Soviet and 2600 Afghan soldiers under Marshal of the Soviet Union Sergei Sokolov participated in the offensive supported by 200 airplanes and 190 helicopters On April 22 after a twoday bombardment of the region by Tu16 Tu22M and Su24 bombers they advanced rapidly into the Panjshir Several battalion strength forces were placed at key passes leading out of the Panjshir Valley while at the same time large helicopter troop landings were made in tributary valleys connected to the Panjshir By blocking the Mujahideens withdrawal routes and securing the high ground the Soviets forced them higher into the mountains then they had previously ventured and scattered their strength as they attempted to avoid being trapped by the helicopter landings Once the strength of Massouds forces were dealt such a deadly blow rather than withdrawing from the valley as they had previously done they began setting up a system of forts and posts throughout the main valley while relinquishing control of the side valleys These tactics proved more effective at rooting out insurgents and breaking up their fighting forces during the offensive but had limited long term success The forts and outposts along the Panjshir Valley were unable to protect roads and convoys as well as they had hoped and these installations proved attractive targets for the Mujahideen to harass Much of the valley was occupied but the Soviets paid a heavy price many soldiers were killed by mines and in ambushes During one battle on April 30 in the Hazara Valley the 1st Battalion of the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment was decimated the losses of Soviet troops were estimated at 60 killed

For the Soviets the operation was partly successful  some of the infrastructure of the Mujahideen created in the time of the truce in 19821983 was destroyed Babrak Karmal completed a propaganda visit to the Panjshir which for some time had become a safe zone However it quickly became apparent that most of Massouds forces had escaped the onslaught and were still able to carry out their harassment tactics Eventually in September the SovietDRA forces once again evacuated the Panjshir Valley leaving occupying forces only in the lower Panjshir

Yousaf and Adkin reported in 1992 that the Soviet forces involved included the 180th Motor Rifle Regiment battalions of the 66th Motor Rifle Brigade and 191st Motor Rifle Regiment a regiment of the 103rd Guards Airborne Division a battalion of the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment accompanied by Afghan forces including the 8th Division the 20th Division and the 37th Commando Brigade It seems likely that the reference to the 180th Motor Rifle Regiment refers to the 682nd Motor Rifle Regiment of the 108th Motor Rifle Division based in Kabul

The 8th offensive was a followup to the 7th involving mostly airborne forces

The 9th offensive was carried out in reprisal for the destruction of the DRA garrison at Peshgur during which Massouds mobile groups took 500 prisoners including 126 officers and killed a brigadier of the Afghan Army The prisoners had been marched into the mountains where the Mujahideen claimed they were killed by a Soviet aerial bombardment a claim others dubbed suspicious

Initiated hours after the raid the Soviet counterattack installed a new garrison in Peshgur and pursued the retreating Mujahideen The group escorting the captured Afghan officers was caught in the open by Soviet helicopters and in the ensuing fight most of the prisoners were killed with both sides projecting on each other the responsibility for the incident 

In 1986 Mikhail Gorbachev announced his intention of withdrawing the Soviet contingent from Afghanistan From then on the Soviets were mostly concerned with avoiding losses in the Panjshir sector and they observed a tacit ceasefire unprovoked shooting by Soviet troops was forbidden and the Mujahideen refrained from attacking Soviet bases Despite provocations ordered by Najibullahs government to draw the Soviets into further fighting the situation generally remained calm enabling Massoud to carry out his strategic offensive capturing much of Baghlan and Takhar provinces The last Soviet and Afghan troops present in the lower Panjshir were finally evacuated in June 1988

Boris and Amanda crash land into a high fade zone of Widge and have to leave quickly because Rodey a giant talking mouse shrinks When the air gets too thin for Boris and Gorwen to fly through the search party land at Border Camp in Widge The Widgets the native inhabitants of Widge  small squirrellike animals let them stay for the night In the morning they help Scott and Rodey as to which road they should take Rodey could speak Widgen  the language of Widge

With the Widgets as their guides the search party set off through the Woods of Widge Jenny tries to contact Gorwen on a videophone to ask whether Boris took a veetarod with him a long thin instrument the Keepers use to locate Veetons with Scott starts to suspect that the Widgets are not all that they seem when Boris falls into a quagmire which could have been avoided if Boris could have read the sign saying Danger Quagmire Rodey the mouse goes off in a huff and the others leave him to catch up with them The veetarod which Boris had taken with him works and leads the party to a huge tree unfortunately the door into the tree is locked

The Widgets have hidden the first Veeton inside a huge book tree Boris and Amanda manage to unlock it and enter it in search of the Veeton while Scott and the dragon Gorwen search for Rodey who is still missing Boris and Amanda follow some signs to the library Inside Boris solves a clue and finds the first Veeton The kindly Book Tree lets Boris take some books with him for when he can read They find the way out and try contacting Doris with the news however Doris never replies The credits roll up on Doris with a huge look of shock and absolute terror on her face

With the help of the veetarod Scott and Gorwen find Boris Amanda and the first Veeton in a gravel pit the exit of the Book Tree Then it starts to snow Scott finds a snowflake clue which tells them to go to Ash Rock They set out through the snow however almost as soon as they set off the Widgets corner them and engage them in a snowball fight After the fight which everyone enjoys Scott Boris and Gorwen find that the Widgets have taken the Veeton and Boris rucksack and that they have kidnapped Amanda Gorwen sets off to find them while Boris and Scott continue to Ash Rock

Meanwhile at the Veetacore House we find out why Doris is not replying to Boris message Charn the Evil One an exiled Pelamot has returned to try to take over Pelamar Boris can only see the back of Doris head in his videophone and therefore thinks Doris is simply being rude when she cuts him off At the Veetacore House Charn reveals his plan When the Veetacore is mended he will chant a spell which must be chanted as the last Veeton is fitted with malevolant words rather than the kind and hopeful ones at the back of the book Jenny at first stands up to Charn refusing to mend the Veetacore for his purposes but he scares her into obedience by melting Frug Morris pet caterpillar with his magic hands if he points at something and keeps his hand on it a jet of green light shoots out of his hand and melts the object he is pointing at He threatens to melt Morris as well but Jenny decides it would be safer to help him after all Doris tries to contact Boris as discreetly as possible but Charn sees her at the last minute and melts her

Amanda chases the Widgets who stole Boris rucksack with the Veeton in it She rescues it and in doing so finds Rodey but they find themselves lost in the snow Boris and Scott find another clue at Ash Rock They leave a sign for Amanda and Gorwen to follow The veetarod then leads them up to the top of a mountain When they are about halfway up some rocks hit Boris on the head One of the rocks is not a rock at all it is a Veeton Gorwen catches up with Amanda and Rodey and they continue up to the top of the mountain where they treat Boris head and contact Jenny again

At the Veetacore House Jenny persuades Charn to let Morris knit her a scarf She continues to read the book for Charn who cannot read and rebuilds the Veetacore When the search party contact Jenny she holds up Morris scarf On the scarf are the words HELP CHARN Gorwen decides to return to Pelamar alone with the two Veetons He leaves Rodey Amanda Boris and Scott to find the last Veeton by themselves

Noone can face Charn and live Only Gorwen has a chance  
During the night the search party pitch a tent and spend the night at the top of the mountains During the night two troublesome Widgets sneak into the tent and steal Boris map of Widge They rip the map up leaving Boris Amanda Scott and Rodey alone with no map no time and no words to help them Suddenly a waterfall of words appears gushing down the mountainside giving them a clue as what to do next

Meanwhile Gorwen makes his way back through Widge by night He appears outside the Veetacore House where he is seen by Jenny and Charn Morris goes out the back door of the house to try and tell Gorwen

Gorwen returns to the Veetacore House where Charn is waiting for him Morris tries to warn him but is zapped by Charn There is a great battle and Charn is eventually beaten forever Charn had already been beaten once by Gorwen and as a result was banished from Pelamar

After the battle Gorwen knows he still has time to save Morris Doris Frug and the rest of Morris pets that Charn had melted even though he himself is becoming weaker and weaker Doris then sends a message to Scott Rodey Amanda and Boris Charn beaten but Gorwen fading Hurry Then Rodey finds a tunnel through the mountains

Rodey rescues the veetarod which had fallen down a deep chasm in the tunnel The veetarod leads them up to the top of the mountain Then Boris realises that the Widgets had taken his bat Amanda persuades Boris to swap some of the books that the Book Tree had given him for the bat The Widgets agree

At the Veetacore House the Veetacore is still unfinished Frug meanwhile has become a very large cocoon and Gorwen has faded so much he is almost invisible Jenny tries conatacting Boris to tell him to hurry up Scott and Amanda spot the last Veeton balanced on a tree that has fallen over wedged between two cliffs

Scott with the help of the Widgets manages to rescue the last Veeton Boris Amanda and Scott then start the long trek down to the bottom of the mountain after thanking and waving to the Widgets who make a banner for them out of a picnic cloth which says Goodbye Good Luck

Meanwhile Doris and Morris fit the penultimate piece of the Veetacore and wait for the others to return with the last Veeton

Boris Amanda and Scott continue through the Woods of Widge until they reach Border Camp Boris pulls out his magical flying bat and flies home to Pelamar with Scott and Amanda clasping onto the bat with him

At the Veetacore House Doris Morris and Jenny gather round a cracked wall and measure the distance They are convinced that it is getting bigger A short while later after Boris is shown encouraging his bat to go faster Jenny measures the crack again while Doris and Morris are asleep with Frug Gorwen has almost vanished now he is so pale

The search party crashland in Pelamar miles away from the Veetacore House To get to the house Boris makes his cricket bat into a skateboard They burst into the Veetacore House on top of Doris who had just declared that she did not believe that they were coming They take out the Veeton and look for which way up it is supposed to go Jenny looks in the book which tells the Keepers how to fix the Veetacore however she finds that Frug had eaten the last page

Just then Frug erupts from his cocoon revealing the last four words of the missing sentence in the book on each of his four wings The Veetacore Keepers and the children work out what the sentence is and the last Veeton is placed by Morris Doris and Boris into the Veetacore while chanting the spell The Veetacore glows and hums causing Gorwen to come back Rodey to return to his normal size and the rest of Pelamar to fill with life again

With their mission complete the children return to their own world  only a short time after they left it They all find a miniature veeton in their pockets as a gift from Pelamar  proving their adventure really did happen

Panasonic Lumix DMCFZ50 is a superzoom bridge digital camera by Panasonic It is the successor of the Panasonic Lumix DMCFZ30

While the FZ30 was a major upgrade of the FZ20 both internally and externally the FZ50 differs relatively little from the FZ30 The main differences are

The camera is known for its highquality optics and effective optical image stabilization system Many professional reviews have commended it for its excellent pictures at ISO 100 but it has a reputation for excessively smeary noise reduction at higher ISO settings a problem that can be ameliorated by using the RAW capture mode It uses proprietary lithiumion batteries There is no storage built into the camera an MMC SD or SDHC memory card is required Highspeed SD cards up to 2 GB and SDHC cards up to 32GB are supported

The camera has many SLRlike handling features dual control wheels for aperture and shutter speed manual focus focusbywire and zoom rings and a flash hot shoe It is among the largest nonSLR cameras built and is positioned at the high end of the bridgecamera market

Zooming while recording movies is supported since the zoom is manual The camera also includes an extended optical zoom system providing greater optical zoom ability when shooting at lower resolutions giving up to 193 zoom at 3MP Essentially this just crops the center out of the image incamera but can be useful for metering and framing purposes Apertures from 28 to 11 are supported though the largest apertures are not available at high zoom levels 37 at full zoom Shutter speeds range from 60 s to 12000 s although shutter speeds faster than 11000 s are not available at the widest apertures Several different autofocus modes are available The AFmacro setting can be selected for all camera modes Macro capability is not outstanding 5cm minimum focal range at 1 zoom and the telemacro capability present on the lowerend Panasonic FZ models the ability to focus down to 1m at 420mm is not present the FZ50 can only focus down to 2m at 420mm However the FZ50 is commonly used to record highmagnification macro images with an inexpensive conversion lens the most commonly used lens for this purpose is the 8diopter Raynox 250

The FZ50 has a screw mount to accept 55mm filters and is compatible with a wide variety of Panasonicbranded and thirdparty lens converters which can provide greater wideangle telephoto and closeup capabilities

The FZ50 can also record in a RAW format which is supported by Adobe Camera Raw and the free UFRaw plugin for GIMP and many other thirdparty programs the camera comes with a special version of Silkypix for conversion RAW files are recorded in around three seconds with fast SD cards which is one of the best results among nondigital singlelens reflex cameras however there is no RAW buffer as on many digital SLRs Unlike its predecessors the FZ50 does not support TIFF format

The zoom and focus mechanism is internal the lens does not physically extend beyond the camera housing when focusing and zooming Startup is under one second as the lens does not need to be extended

Desmond Leslie
Desmond Arthur Peter Leslie 29 June 1921 London  21 February 2001 Antibes France was a British pilot film maker writer and musician of English Irish and Scottish descent He was the younger son and youngest child of Shane Leslie and his wife Marjorie ne Ide Leslie His father was a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill

During his lifetime he served as a Spitfire pilot in the RAF during World War II became one of the first pioneers of electronic music and coauthored one of the first books on UFOs Flying Saucers Have Landed 1953 with writer and UFO contactee George Adamski

Desmond is probably most famous for punching theatre critic Bernard Levin in front of eleven million viewers during an edition of the live satirical TV show That Was The Week That Was in 1962 Ostensibly this was to protect the honour of his thenwife Agnes Bernelle in response to Levins critical review of her show Savagery and Delight

Bernelle stated in her biography The Fun Palace that the show was poorly received due to Desmonds custombuilt loudspeakers being moved below the stage and that Desmond had failed to check the situation missing the show for a social appointment As a consequence no one behind the front two rows heard a word she sang She claimed he probably punched Levin more out of embarrassment than loyalty Levins obituaries described Leslie only as an expert on UFOs

Throughout his life Desmond Leslie published several books including a number on the subject of UFOsthe first of which Flying Saucers Have Landed was coauthored with George Adamski He also wrote a series of satirical books ranging from The Jesus File dealing with the crucifixion of Christ as recorded through the paperwork and internal correspondences of the Roman Garrison to How Britain Won The Space Race which he cowrote with celebrated amateur astronomer Patrick Moore

Desmond Leslie was briefly a screenwriterdirector for film and television


During financial difficulties during the production of Stranger At My Door Desmond opted to compose the music for the film himself Some stated the music was the best part of the film In the early 1950s Leslie designed the worlds first effective multitrack sound mixing desk which he had built by Rupert Neve It can still be seen in his family home Castle Leslie Monaghan where it has been an object of reverence for visitors such as Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney

During the late 1950s he began nurturing his interest in contemporary music In his small home studio he experimented with the sounds of musique concrte In January 1960 Leslie pressed a single acetate called Music of the Future All Leslie recordings were later licensed to Joseph Weinburger and Leslies recordings were pressed onto a short series of 78rpm library discs occasionally being put to use in science and mystery based programing such as early Doctor Who episodes He used a great number of tape sources to create his pieces some sources he mentions in his liner notes are motor horns humming tops and bells

In 2005 Jonny Trunks British record label Trunk Records rereleased Desmonds 1960 acetate never before released commercially The sounds on this release were mastered from the original acetate The recordings are believed to have been made between 1955 and 1959 and included are Desmonds original sleevenotes containing information pertaining to each selection

His first wife was Agnes Elizabeth Bernauer Agnes Bernelle on 18 August 1945 That marriage ended in divorce The couple had two sons and one daughter


He remarried to Jennifer Helen Strong in 1970 they had two daughters

During the 1990s he devoted his time to restoring the aging family home of Castle Leslie which eventually opened to the public He later relocated to Nice France Emphysema claimed his life in Antibes in 2001 aged 79

Diamond industry in Israel
The Diamond industry of Israel is an important world player in producing cut diamonds for wholesale In 2010 Israel became the chair of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme  cut diamonds constituted 232 of Israels total exports and they were the countrys biggest export product amounting to 12 of the worlds production

Diamond cutting is a traditional Jewish craft with centuries of history In the late 15th century Jewish diamond cutter Lodewyk van Berken invented the scaif polishing wheel a technological innovation that revolutionized the industry

What was to become the Israeli diamond industry began in 1937 eleven years before the State of Israel was established when the first diamond polishing plant was opened in Petah Tikva by refugee experts from the Netherlands In 1938 the 15 import duty on imported rough stones was removed By 1944 the industry employed 3300 workers in 33 factories with P 1320000 capital investment entirely Jewish The value of exports was over P 3200000 mainly to the United States Canada and India it was the largest value of any single commodity exported from Mandatory Palestine that year

Between 1944 and 1948 the industry suffered from the increasing lawlessness and in February 1948 closed down completely

After a state was declared the consumer economy was shifted to a war economy This came at the height of a diamond crisis as many wartorn economies were struggling to reestablish

During the first fifteen years of Israels existence diamonds and Jaffa oranges were the new states main export products

After reaching its lowest point in the wake of the 1948 closedown the industry has continued to grow producing a world leader in the diamond industry

In the beginning of the 21st century Israel is one of the worlds three major centers for polished diamonds alongside Belgium and India Israels net polished diamond exports slid 228 in 2012 as polished diamond exports fell to 556 billion from 72 billion in 2011 Net exports of rough diamonds dropped 201 to 28 billion and net exports of polished diamonds slipped 249 percent to 43 billion while net rough diamond imports dropped 129 percent to 38 billion The United States is the largest market accounting for 36 of overall export market for polished diamonds while Hong Kong remains at second with 28 percent and Belgium at 8 coming in third

In 2007 when diamonds still constituted almost 24 of Israels total exports 12 of world diamonds by their value were polished in the country In 2010 this number decreased to 9  diamonds amounted to 28 of Israels total exports and they were still 12 of the worlds production

The industry is located in the Diamond District located in Ramat Gan in the Tel Aviv District The complex is made up of four buildings interconnected with walkways The entire trading operation takes place in this complex The Diamond Tower in the district contains the worlds largest diamond trading floor

Israels government funds a nonprofit industry body the Israel Diamond Institute to represent organisations and institutions involved in Israels diamond industry

The Israeli diamond industry guarantees all diamonds are 100 naturally made and participates in the Kimberley Process a certification scheme whose goal is to ensure no blood diamonds enter the marketplace

Some human rights campaigners however say the Kimberley Process defines conflict diamonds too narrowly only relating to uncut stones enabling Israels diamondcutting industry to avoid attention The Boycott Divestment and Sanctions BDS movement among others has called for diamonds processed in Israel to be considered conflict diamonds

Cotheridge Court
In 963 Oswald Bishop of Worcester granted land called Coddanhrycce to thegn Aelfric for three successive generations being limited to male heirs

In the Domesday Book a timberframed court is mentioned The existing house dates back to the 16th century and perhaps even further back It is built upon the site of the original dwelling mentioned in the Domesday Book

Prior to 1615 the manor was held by a succession of various owners In 1615 it was sold to William Berkeley 15821658 of Cowleigh eldest son of Rowland Berkeley 15481611 of Worcester and Spetchley a wealthy Worcester clothier who originated from Hereford The house then was a large twostorey timberframed dwelling with a third floor of gabled attics having carved bargeboards The house contained a small panelled room known as the sots hole where drunks were held in order to sleep off their drunkenness This room probably dates back to pre15th century and before when the house was a Court House 

William Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1617 was succeeded by his son Sir Rowland Berkeley 16131669 Sir Rowlands only son Thomas died unmarried on 25 October 1669 in Greece He was on a diplomatic mission to Turkey travelling with His Excellency Sir Daniel Harvey from King Charles II to Sultan Mahomethan Emperor of the Turks The two men were travelling from Constantinople towards Thessalonica when Thomas fell ill He was 30 years old and his remains were buried amongst Christians Having no other sons Cotheridge Court passed to Sir Rowlands eldest daughter Elizabeth She married in 1681 Henry Green who adopted the surname Berkeley Their eldest son became the next Rowland Berkeley of Cotheridge who died in 1731

In 1770 the entrance front to the house as well as the south front were cased with brick and the old windows were replaced with large sash windows The old gabled attics were concealed behind a wall of brick and sham glazed windows were added to the new brick front giving the appearance of a third floor without attics The north wing of the house as well as part of the back were not modernized and remained as timber and plaster

In 1764 another Rowland Berkeley 17321805 became Sheriff of Worcestershire and from May to September 1774 was Member of Parliament for Droitwich

In the mid or late 18th century a haha was installed where the gardens met with the pastureland This was to provide the house with a clean view of the grazing cattle and the breathtaking prominent Malvern Hills in the far distance

Rowland Berkeley 17321805 was succeeded by his brother the Rev Henry Rowland Berkeley DCL Fellow of New College Oxford who also died childless in 1832 Eventually it passed to William Berkeley Esquire who died in 1869 and the manor passed to his eldest son the Rev William Comyns Berkeley His son Rowland eldest brother to Herbert Bowyer Berkeley inherited the manor 

At about the midpart of the century a delicate ornamental stone balustrade was added to the top of the brick facing above the sham glazed windows

It is mentioned in John Noakes History of Worcestershire that from the road to Bromyard an avenue of limes some threequarters of a mile in length and in a straight line runs from the road to Cotheridge Court

Many Deadwood miners and businessmen relocated to Leadville Colorado in January 1879 to follow the promise of the new rush and the next big strike Jack Langrishe and Company would once again take the stage with fellow Deadwood manager Billy Nuttalls Bella Union Theatre Company who opened the new Leadville Grand Central Theatre Al Swearengen and the Gem Theater troupe visited Leadville February 1879 but chose to return to Deadwood The Langrishe Troupe continued to perform to audiences in Deadwood Central Lead and to the soldiers at Ft Meade through the summer of 1879 The Jack Langrishe Companys final performance to a Deadwood audience would be Our American Cousin August 15 1879 performed by troupe artists The Gilberts

Richard Alsop IV House
The Richard Alsop IV House is a historic house at 301 High Street in Middletown Connecticut Completed in 1839 the house is a distinctive example of transitional Greek Revival and Italianate architecture and is nationally significant for the extremely wellpreserved drawings on its interior walls The site was designated a US National Historic Landmark on January 16 2009 The house presently serves as the Davison Arts Center of Wesleyan University

This stately mansion faces east towards the Connecticut River from the west side of High Street opposite the intersection of Court Street It is set back from the street atop a rise A high iron fence borders the property along High Street This house makes an important contribution to the elegance and high style which characterized High Street as the preferred residential area in nineteenthcentury Middletown

The Alsop house was built in 18381839 by Richard Alsop IV for his twicewidowed mother Mrs Maria Alsop Dana The shortlived architectural firm formed by Landra Beach Platt and Francis Benne who worked together in New Haven under the tutelage of Sidney Mason Stone was evidently responsible for the design although it is possible that they drew their inspiration from Ithiel Towns own home in New Haven which may account for the similarities of the two structures as well as for a former attribution of the Alsop House to Town himself Stones possible contributions have yet to be explored The wellknown Middletown builders Barzillai Sage and Isaac W Baldwin performed the masonry and carpentry work respectively The house remained in the hands of Alsop family until its acquisition in 1948 by Wesleyan University

This house is significant architecturally for its transitional GreekTuscan Italianate appearance The cubical twostory central block with overhanging eaves is flanked by colonnaded story wings A swagandtassel design decorates the frieze of the central block which also displays a veranda supported by delicate ironwork and surmounted by an intricate balustrade

A rear colonnaded wing which originally housed servants quarters and service facility has been enclosed At the west end of this wing are attached an art gallery of recent construction and the art library originally the stable

The interior of the Alsop house is noted for its decorative wall paintings The stair hall displays trompe loeil painting of figures in niches while the parlors dining room and morningroom feature oilonplaster paintings The parlor paintings are classically derived and some subjects are Raphaelesque in origin In the morning room the formal classicism of the parlors is replaced by scenes derived from the rural Italian tradition of wall decoration Local birds and insects are featured in these scenes The dining room displays a painted frieze The paintings are believed to have been executed by German or Italian immigrants Possible contributors include the noted Italian artist Nicola Monachesi According to family documentation the paintings were executed between 1839 and 1860

The main rooms of the house are furnished with period antiques and provide a suitable atmosphere in which to display the wall painting In its carefully restored condition the Alsop house remains a monument to the skill of its designers while serving Wesleyan University and the community as an art center

<doc id="7698684" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7698684" title="Mr Bones video game">
Mr Bones video game
Mr Bones is a multigenre video game conceptualized by E Ettore Annunziata developed by Zono and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn in 1996 The soundtrack to Mr Bones was composed and performed by Ronnie Montrose with cutscenes and art assets done by Angel Studios

DaGoulian a mad philosopher who believes that one can only ensure the survival of good by making evil thrive sets out to purify the world with evil By playing a special set of drums powered by science and alchemy he is able to tap into a primal power which he calls skeletal magnetism or skeletism and summon the dead from their graves as his skeletal soldiers

One inmate of the cemetery however is pure of heart and is thus resurrected not with red evil skeletism but with blue good skeletism Because of this he retains his free will This fact is quickly noticed by DaGoulian and he orders his newly created army to destroy this rebel who calls himself simply Mr Bones

Mr Bones soon becomes determined to stop DaGoulians plan He must find a way to counteract the evil of red skeletism before DaGoulians minions catch up to him

One of Mr Bones most distinctive qualities is in it having very few levels which share the same style of gameplay with only a few exceptions almost every level looks and feels different from the rest Some levels simply change the camera perspective while others offer up their own distinct genre The most common thread running throughout the game is that of an actionplatform game with slight gameplay and viewing angle variations per level but at times the styles diverge far more drastically ranging from a musicrhythm game to a Breakoutstyle game to a game of memorization Once a level has been beaten the player can return directly to that level from the main menu any time they choose

In lieu of a normal health bar Mr Bones has a supply of skeletism When his skeletism level drops he gradually loses body parts being reduced to just a skull and spine at his lowest levels His lost body parts remain in play and can be reattached though unless Mr Bones regains skeletism the reattachment will be fragile and even landing from a significant height will cause the parts to fall off again The games physics also take Mr Bones state of completion into account for example if he has lost both legs he will crawl with his arms and cannot run or jump In most levels Mr Bones can shoot a beam from his hand which destroys enemies and restores his skeletism level He can also restore skeletism by collecting blue items

The cinematics were designed and directed by Allen Battino who also performed the role of Mr Bones via motion capture

A playable demo of Mr Bones was exhibited at the May 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo

The music was composed by musician Ronnie Montrose This was part of a larger trend of established musicians in the late 1990s who composed music for video games with other examples being Ian McDonald composing for Wachenrder and Stewart Copeland composing music for Spyro the Dragon

Mr Bones polarized reviewers who sharply disagreed on whether the gameplay was bizarre and extraordinarily original or mundane hop n bop platforming GameSpots Tom Ham gave it a modest score but a relentlessly positive review applauding the unique stage designs varying perspectives titular character beautiful and eerie visual design and bluesrock soundtrack He summarized the game as a cool musically interactive multilevel scroller thats surprisingly fun to play The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were also enthralled with Dan Hsu summarizing Mr Bones is completely unique  you can tell that some true geniuses worked on this project Most of them commented that the different gameplay types in the many levels are consistently ingenious and fun though SushiX said the gameplay is weak and that it is the humorous and audiovisually stunning fullmotion video cutscenes which make the game enjoyable In contrast Scary Larry of GamePro completely panned the game citing unfinished graphics unfairly difficult enemy AI and insipid hopnbop gameplay He said the music is a positive point but the spoken word background in Glass Shards is annoying A Next Generation critic commented that the concept of the game is refreshingly unusual but that most of the levels use fairly average sidescrolling gameplay which does not live up to the originality of the concept He still concluded the game to be moderately appealing due to its humor and especially its massive length Lee Nutter of the British Sega Saturn Magazine said that due in part to its much delayed PAL conversion Mr Bones was outdated by the time of its release in the UK He contended that the different gameplay types just make the game feel like a generic platformer with a lot of outofplace minigames However his main criticism was that the game is too distinctively American

Institute of Advanced Legal Studies
The Institute of Advanced Legal Studies IALS is a member institute of the School of Advanced Study University of London Founded in 1947 it is a national academic centre of excellence serving the legal community and universities across the United Kingdom and the world through legal scholarship facilities and its comparative law library

The mission of the Institute is to be the focal point of legal research for the United Kingdom and the countries of the British Commonwealth 

Since 1976 the Institutes home has been Charles Clore House located in the heart of Bloomsbury at 17 Russell Square

The Institute of Advanced Legal Studies was established in 1947 in response to recommendations made in 1932 by Lord Atkin that the United Kingdom needed an institution which would be a headquarters for academic research and would promote the advancement of knowledge of the law in the most general terms On 11 June 1948 the Institute was officially opened by the Lord Chancellor William Jowitt 1st Earl Jowitt The first director was Professor Sir David Hughes Parry a distinguished Professor of English Law at the London School of Economics and for many years ViceChancellor of the University of London The Librarian K Howard Drake also acted as administrative secretary for the Institute

Housed at 25 Russell Square the Institute occupied all floors of the building the ground and first floors reserved for the library with rooms on the second and third converted into offices or studyseminar rooms The library held 11000 books in its first year a substantial number donated by Dr Charles Huberich An internal telephone system connected all the rooms with a hand book lift installed to move books from floor to floor

By 1949 the Institute was running out of space and were given permission to extend into the basement and ground floor 26 Russell Square Here it remained until 1976 when the Institute moved into No 17 Russell Square part of the newly built Charles Clore House designed by Sir Denys Lasdun At the official opening on 1st April 1976 the then Chancellor of the University of London Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother overstayed and her official schedule had to be abandoned

In 1994 the IALS became a member of the School of Advanced Study The Institute is also home to the British Institute of International and Comparative Law

A fiveyear refurbishment of Charles Clore House is currently underway the first phase of which was completed in September 2012 incorporating a larger caf and improved lecture facilities on the ground floor

The IALS library holds a collection of over 300000 legal texts complemented by over 3000 current serial titles reports and legislative materials It has been described as the jewel in the Institutes crown and is a repository library for legal texts published in the United Kingdom The library covers five floors of Charles Clore House with the library entrance on the fourth floor The library catalogue forms part of a shared catalogue with its fellow School of Advanced Study institutes and that of Senate House Library

The Institute library is considered one of the worlds leading comparative research libraries holding significant material not otherwise available in the United Kingdom Jurisdictions covered include countries in North America Latin America Europe including the European Union and the Commonwealth The library is particularly strong in Public International Law It has a large collection of United States Federal resources and holdings of State primary resources focused on California New York Pennsylvania Texas and Louisiana Postgraduate law students of the University of London colleges including University College London London School of Economics and Political Science Kings College London and Queen Mary University of London rely exclusively on the Institutes research holdings for coursework

Since the late 1990s IALS has participated in collaborative and standalone digital projects resulting in a number of searchable databases publicly available via the website These include FLAG Foreign Law Guides FIT Flare Index to Treaties and EagleI which builds upon the original Jisc funded Intute Law project formerly SOSIG Law

The IALS library has partnered with other libraries and organisations in promotions and projects to highlight legal research The library concentrates on printed and digital resources often as lead developer for webbased initiatives Ongoing collaborations with the British Library and BAILII have led to increased web presence for legal research with IALS hosting BAILII and supporting its role in providing free access to full text British and Irish legal materials The Concordat with the British Library is a collaboration to map existing holdings in foreign legal materials in both libraries and collate information to form a national collection of foreign official gazettes Recently the library became a charter member of LLCMDigital a USbased consortium of libraries dedicated to the preservation of legal documentation for dissemination via a searchable online database

The Institute actively promotes research by its own academic staff and students in conjunction with its role as a national legal research centre Research centres at the Institute contribute to legal research via externally funded projects or study with the Sir William Dale Centre and Woolf Chair of Legal Education at the fore Areas of research conducted by the Institute include legislative drafting human rights international financial regulation and transnational taxation law Notable recent works by Institute faculty includes Thorntons Legislative Drafting Fifth Edition by Professor Helen Xanthaki and Foundations and Future of Financial Regulation and European Comparative Company Law by Professor Mads Andenas

Greater Lowell
Greater Lowell is the name given to the city of Lowell Massachusetts and its suburbs which are found in Northern Middlesex County Massachusetts the Merrimack Valley and Southern New Hampshire

The Greater Lowell area as defined as the Lowell Metropolitan area consists of the towns of Billerica Chelmsford Dracut Dunstable Groton Lowell Pepperell Tewksbury Tyngsborough and Westford The town of Pelham New Hampshire may also be included in Greater Lowell

The New England city and town area Division LowellBillericaChelmsford contains some towns that can be considered part of Greater Lowell Ashby Ayer Billerica Chelmsford Dracut Groton Littleton Lowell Shirley Tewksbury Townsend Tyngsborough Westford and Harvard in Massachusetts and Pelham in New Hampshire

The towns of Greater Lowell in Massachusetts have a combined population of 299550 based on the 2010 census Including the town of Pelham Greater Lowell has 312447 inhabitants

The city of Lowell is a cultural and institutional center for the region It is home to the Tsongas Center at UMass Lowell and the Lowell National Historical Park which preserves the regions legacy as an early textile manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution The University of Massachusetts Lowell and a campus of Middlesex Community College are located in the city as well as are Lowell General Hospital and Saints Medical Center the regional hospitals Greater Lowell Technical High School serves many of the towns in the region

Lowell is home to the Superior and District Court for Northern Middlesex County and is technically a county seat although Massachusetts counties are largely historical in function Culturally many residents of Greater Lowell have deep roots in the city itself tend to be more blue collar and speak with an urban Boston accent Greater Lowell is split politically while the region as a whole is more likely to vote for a conservative candidate than other parts of the state whereas the city of Lowell is more likely to vote liberally

The economy of Greater Lowell is closely tied to that of Greater Boston Outside of the services health and retail sectors major employers are in high technology and defense with a stillshrinking manufacturing sector

Suburban sprawl and serious economic hardships have reduced the role Lowell plays in its suburbs over the decades The entire region is often considered a component of the much larger Greater Boston area as Lowell is only 25 miles from downtown Boston Suburban office parks shopping malls and the severe decline of heavy industry in New England have pulled the economic focus away from the once great industrial and commercial base in Lowell itself Additionally the population of Lowell is at 1900 levels despite large growth among the suburban population

Llys Rhosyr
Llys Rhosyr is an archaeological site near Newborough in Anglesey the ruins of a preEdwardian commotal court 

Llys Rhosyr was a commotal centre before Edward I of Englands conquest of Wales and debate now surrounds the former use of the Rhosyr site Archaeologists at Gwynedd Archaeological Trust consider it to have been a royal home and have established an exhibition in the PritchardJones Institute in the village on their findings supporting this theory Excavations reveal that the enclosure had a hall accommodation and storage barns 

A fierce sandstorm in the winter of 1332 buried the site and much of the surrounding area Henry Rowlands mentions the site in his 18th century Mona Antiqua Restaurata By the 20th century nothing was visible on the surface though local people knew the precise location of the remains which was always known as caer llys the field of the court in English 

From 1992 it was excavated by the Gwynedd Archaeological Trust and was opened to the public for the first time in 1995 What remains is the outlines of the walls around only a quarter of which are exposed including the main surrounding wall and foundations and lower walls of three large buildings possibly the hall a chamber and storage barns Many artifacts were recovered from the site including pottery and silverware indicating use by people of a high social status 

A reconstruction of the Great Hall of Llys Rhosyr is planned as part of the redevelopment of St Fagans National History Museum Cardiff using a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded in 2012 The building with its walls will be able to accommodate groups overnight when it is completed

<doc id="7698798" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7698798" title="Mustang Ironheart">
Mustang Ironheart
Mustang Ironheart is the protagonist in the extremely rare Mustang Ironheart series of graphic novels and movie adaptations He is the central character in the 14part series that chronicles his life primarily as a detective and soldier The series is inspiration for multiple spinoffs including Brocks War Spirit Wings that follows his fathers feats in World War I as well as the Deke Street series

Ironheart can be described as a rough and gritty hero who will use any means necessary to enforce his brand of justice

The Mustang Ironheart Saga can be broken up into three major parts with the exception of Mission Roundhouse a onepart story that details Mustangs rise to the top of the Thai underground street fighting circuit

Taking place in the 1980s Mustangs high school years are chronicled in Mustang vs The Corridors of Time and Mustang vs The Quantum Lepers The stories follow Mustangs construction of a time machine and his travels through the annals of time The time machine constructed during his high school years resurfaces at the end of the saga in Mustangs Law but is recalibrated by Jimmy Ice as a clone machine The time machine additionally may or may not explain Mustangs involvement in the Vietnam War although it is never clarified

The two books from Mustangs high school years still remain unpublished manuscripts which Ekim Htiek was rumored to write while in college there is question as to if their existence is real or not However the storylines are occasionally referenced in later Mustang books

Mustangs part in the Vietnam War follows his participation with the Tiger Riders an elite group of the military so secret that their existence is even hidden from the government It is not clear if the author Ekim Htiek created the idea of the Tiger Riders for the graphic novels or if it was based on knowledge of an actual military group rumored to exist during the Korean War and Vietnam War Jungle Fury Bandoliers of Glory Tiger Riders II and Code Name Freedom Tiger Riders III follow a subplot that starts very patriotic but slowly declines into a darker tone that graphically emphasizes the horrors of war

The longest part of the Ironheart saga is told through eight stories In the early 90s following his sisters death Mustang becomes a detective in the Valiant City Police force During this time we are introduced to Mustangs nemesis Jimmy Ice as well as other villains including The Mongoose The Red Python and The Ninja King Following the stories Ironheart and Brass Tactics Mustang quits and rejoins the force This creates a large continuity error in the saga as he is rumored to have traveled to Japan to train with the great Master Tabemono before his death in the late 80s despite the portion of the saga taking place in the early 90s

Following his return to Valiant City in Preludes of Iron the saga takes its only foray into humor with the buddy comedy Bad 2 the Bone After Shadowwrath of the Ninja The Revenge the return of the Tiger Riders in Blood of the Tiger Riders Turf Wars and International Waters the saga and series conclude with Mustangs Law

Little is known about the final graphic novel Mustangs Law due to an extremely limited amount of prints but its rumored to feature the death and resurrection of Mustang

Ironheart is portrayed by Mike Treveloni in various films PSAs and shorts Like the comics the films are not released chronologically

The first film adaptation Preludes of Iron was based on the comic of the same name The movie had a short theater run debuting February 2007 and was released on DVD in May 2007 Mike Treveloni played Mustang supported by Cassie Ramoska as his love interest Veronica Grace and Ricky Faust as his sidekick as they battled The Red Python and recurring villain Jimmy Ice

Mike Treveloni was slated to reprise the role of Mustang Ironheart as he battled the fabled Ninja King and a cyberterrorist plot to rule the city The movie has since been put into turnaround due to a controversial draft in which the usual ninja foes were changed to gun toting Marxist guerrillas Creator Ekim Htiek reportedly endorsed the change however producers felt audiences werent ready for things to get too real

A script for the long anticipated Mustangs Law is rumored to be in the works It allegedly will follow the darker grittier tone of the original graphic novel and if the rumors hold any ground it will explain the birth of Mustang Ironheart via a grandfather paradox in which he out duels his father to win his mothers affections

While it was the first story published in Spring of 1994 Ironheart is not the first story chronologically The first story in the timeline is the yet to be published Mustang vs The Corridors of Time




In the weeks leading up to the 2009 ComicCon postcards were circulated amongst comic book stores and head shops featuring the image of the deity Chaac wearing mirrored sunglasses and a fanny pack This sparked whispers that after an eight year absence Ekim Htiek was returning to the printed word with a fifteenth volume of the Ironheart saga Many loyal fans have been uneasy about the prospect of a new Mustang adventure especially one that appears to be shamelessly cashing in on the 2012 doomsday hysteria

ernov massacre
The ernov massacre or ernov tragedy  or Csernova Affair was a shooting that happened in Csernova Kingdom of Hungary today ernov part of Ruomberok Slovakia on 27 October 1907 in which 15 people were killed and many were wounded after gendarmes fired into a crowd of people gathering for the consecration of the local Catholic church The shootings sparked protests in European and American press and turned worlds attention to the treatment of minorities in the Hungarian part of AustriaHungary

On the initiative of Andrej Hlinka the Slovak parish priest of nearby Ruomberok and a native of ernov people of ernov decided to raise money for the construction of a new church The locals raised 80000 crowns and the collections received minor donations from the Slovak Americans as well The construction started in April 1907 and by the autumn the church was ready for consecration 

The locals wanted the church to be consecrated by Hlinka however he was at the time suspended by bishop Sndor Prvy and sentenced to two years of imprisonment due to his proSlovak agitation during the election campaign of 1906 and the subsequent conviction of incitement The people of ernov thus demanded the consecration to be postponed until Hlinka would be able to perform the ceremony The bishopric denied their request and two Magyar speaking priests were appointed in his stead First Canon Anton Kurimsky and after his refusal Dean Martin Pazurik of Likavka

The ceremony was to take place on 27 October 1907 The official procession arrived at the village accompanied by a squad of 15 gendarmes It was protested against by the locals who attempted to block its way to the church to prevent Pazurik from consecrating The demonstration was peaceful in nature although some accounts report stonethrowing at a member of the gendarme escort In panic the gendarme leader sergeant Jn Ladiczky an ethnic Slovak ordered his squad to open fire into the crowd without prior warning killing 15 of the protesting villagers seriously wounding 12 and lightly injuring 40

According to historian Roman Holec the majority of the members of the Hungarian gendarmes involved in the shooting were of Slovak origin

Many attempted to capitalize politically on the events Czech and Slovak nationalists in general and Hlinka in particular On the one hand Hlinkas appeal against his 1906 verdict was rejected thus on 30 November 1907 Hlinka started to serve his jail term in the Csillagbrtn Star Prison Szeged On the other hand Hlinka appealed with success his suspension to the Holy See so it was cancelled on 8 April 1909 When Hlinka left the prison Bishop Prvy appointed him again to his Ruomberok parish and Hlinka consecrated the church in ernov with Prvys consent

The tragedy sparked protests in the European and US press and it turned the worlds attention to the attitude to the minorities in Hungary Important protesting European personalities included the Norwegian Nobel Prize holder Bjrnstjerne Bjrnson the Oxford historian Robert William SetonWatson and the speaker of the Austrian parliament

Todays Slovak politicians  especially the members of the Slovak National Party  even though all perpetrators were Slovaks interpret the event as Hungarian gendarmes shooting at innocent Slovaks during the legal actions after the massacre some gendarmes refused to testify as witnesses because the victims were their relatives With many of their claims regarding the events the Slovak National Party continues to perpetuate a false myth of ernov Some Slovak sources claim that the gendarmes were ethnic Hungarian even though there was a very small number of ethnic Hungarians in the region where the gendarmes were recruited According to Slovak historian Roman Holec professor at Comenius University in Bratislava the majority of the gendarmes were Slovaks from Lipt county According to the official 1910 census over 90 of the population were ethnic Slovaks in that county They were nevertheless honored for the deed because they were in the service of Hungarian state Both the rioters and the gendarmes can be held responsible for the massacre The rioters were violent from lack of fear of getting shot ie that the sergeant would refrain from giving an order of fire or use blanks The gendarmes were shooting in all directions instead of aiming for feet or into the air most victims died due to their head and chest injuries

Liquid capacitive inclinometers
Liquid capacitive inclinometers are inclinometers or clinometers whose sensing elements are made with a liquidfilled differential capacitor they sense the local direction of acceleration due to gravity or movement A capacitive inclinometer has a disclike cavity that is partly filled with a dielectric liquid One of the sides of the cavity has an etched conductor plate that is used to form one of the conductors of a variable parallel plate capacitor The liquid along with the other side of the cavity forms the other plate of the capacitor In operation the sensor is mounted so that the disc is in a vertical plane with its axis horizontal Gravity then acts on the liquid pulling it down in the cavity forming a semicircle As the sensor is rotated the liquid remains in this semicircular pattern covering a different area of the etched plate This change in area results in a change in the capacitance The change in capacitance is then electronically converted into an output signal that is linear with respect to the input angle

Church of the Holy Trinity and Rectory Middletown Connecticut
The Church of the Holy Trinity is an historic Episcopal church at 381 Main Street in Middletown Connecticut Completed in 1874 it is one of the citys finest examples of Gothic Revival architecture Its nearby former rectory also known as the Bishop Acheson House is one of its finest Colonial Revival houses The two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979

This Gothic church at 381 Main Street faces east from the west side of Main Street on the central block between Court and Washington streets it is set back from the street with a lawn in front Its substantial appearance emphasized by the sombre tones of the heavy brownstone construction contrasts greatly with the flat facades and brightly decorated storefronts on Main Street

The Episcopal Church in Middletown had its beginnings as early as 1724 Unlike many Colonial Anglican churches it was firmly committed to the patriot cause during the American Revolution This is the third meeting house of the parish which was formally established as Christ Church in 1750 Several of its ministers have become bishops including Abraham Jarvis John Williams and Edward Campion Acheson father of Dean Acheson

The church was built in 18701874 Henry Dudley was the architect and the firm of McConochie Moor and Mylechreest was the prime contractor Constructed of local brownstone this church displays a symmetrically arranged facade with a buttressed bell tower at the southeast corner A large rose tracery window is the dominant decorative feature of this facade which also displays arched and lancet windows The tower lacks a spire but features narrow arched windows which emphasize its verticality and echo the fenestration of the facades The interior displays elaborate tracery trusses support on cast iron posts The present altar and reredos were added around 1892 and were designed by Charles Haight of New York

In the two decades following the American Civil War a number of institutional buildings were constructed in the Gothic Revival style in Middletown The design of this church is representative of that pattern

The church continues to be used as a church and is in good condition The restoration of most of the stained glass windows was completed in 2011 Its current rector is the Rev Dana Campbell

The former rectory at 144 Broad Street also known as the Bishop Acheson House is now St Lukes Housing for the Elderly It is of the Colonial Revival style and was built in 19021903 The builder and architect are not known

Romie0 and Julie8
Romie0 and Julie8 is the third animated television special made by Nelvana Limited inspired by William Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet Set in the future the two romantic leads in this version are androids who fall in love despite a taboo against their kind having such relationships

The special is also known as Runaway Robots Romie0 and Julie8

In the future two rival robotics firms are hard at work trying to create the next major leap in robotics Both tout their wares at the latest robotics convention The Mega Stellar Company has released their Romie0 model of robot while Super Solar Cybernetics has released Julie8 However unforeseen by their creators Romie0 and Julie8 begin to fall in love harboring feelings for the other

After the convention Romie0 comes to Julie8 and admits that due to their companys rivalry they most likely cannot be together The two decide to run away in order to keep from being broken up Unsure where to go they come across a rather shifty individual named Gizmo who agrees to help them find a safe haven

Meanwhile both of the two robots creators Mr Thunderbottom and Ms Passbinder find that their creations are gone At first they blame the other for stealing their creation but then agree to work in tandem to find their robots when it turns out that neither one knows what has become of them

Unknown to the two creators Gizmo has transported Romie0 and Julie8 to a planet of junk named Trash0Lot where the two come facetoface with an enormous Junk Monster named Sparepartski The monster has Romie0 transported to the other side of the planet but imprisons Julie8 for his own purposes Gizmo appears to her shortly afterward and suggests that she offer to marry the Junk Monster in exchange for Romie0s freedom off the planet Julie8 decides to try this offer and Sparepartski accepts much to the girls displeasure While happy for Romie0s release Julie8 is saddened over her fate and removes a necessary circuit causing her to die In the meantime Sparepartski has found Thunderbottom and Passbinders ship nearby and taken them prisoner as well

Unknown to Julie8 Romie0 has managed to escape from the other side of the planet and has made his way to her chambers Upon finding her with her circuit removed Romie0 reinstalls it and the two attempt to escape Along their way out they encounter their creators trussed up and set about freeing them

However their escape does not go unnoticed and Sparepartski soon starts to chase them across the junkscape The two robot lovers carry their creators in hopes to get them to safety but end up locking up when they run into a rust storm The immobilization of the two robots causes their creators to carry them out of harms way

The rust storm also claims Sparepartski who it is then revealed was a giant scrap concoction created and operated by Gizmo Gizmo reveals his love for machines and after seeing Julie8 at the robotics convention wanted to make her his bride Romie0 and Julie8 then convince Gizmo that with the amount of trash on the planet he could very well fashion his own sweetheart Meanwhile Mr Thunderbottom and Ms Passbinder who have fallen in love with each other have reconciled their differences deciding to unite their robotics houses in a merger much to the delight of Romie0 and Julie8

Songs for Romie0 and Julie8 were composed by John Sebastian with musical score by Patricia Cullen both of whom had also worked on the preceding Nelvana cartoon The Devil and Daniel Mouse Richard Manuel of The Band is also credited

The Market for Liberty
The Market for Liberty is an anarchocapitalist book written by Linda and Morris Tannehill which according to Karl Hess has become something of a classic It was preceded by the selfpublished Liberty via the Market in 1969 Mary Ruwart credits the Tannehills book with winning her over to anarchocapitalism Doug Casey was also converted to anarchocapitalism after reading the book at the behest of Jarret Wollstein According to the Ludwig von Mises Institute it was written just following a period of intense study of the writings of both Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard It was the first significant anarchocapitalist work to hit the libertarian movement coming into print a year before Rothbards Power and Market although Rothbards book had been written earlier

Like Rothbards Man Economy and State The Market For Liberty opposes statutory law and advocates natural law as the basis for society however unlike Man Economy and State which explains what sort of libertarian legal code the market would create in an anarchocapitalist society The Market for Liberty points out that society would not be lawless in the absence of the state Conversely The Market for Liberty spends a great deal of time outlining how different businesses and organizational structures would interact in a laissezfaire society and how these interactions would create checks which would ultimately keep the tendency for crime low In keeping with radical freemarket principles the book is skeptical about the potential for violent anarchocapitalist revolution to bring about good outcomes

Chapter 1 If We Dont Know Where Were Going notes the growing dissatisfaction among youth the many problems society faces and the need for a clear goal rather than just an adversary eg the state It claims that the authors are not advocating any type of utopia that depends on the infallibility of man in order to function It contends that if the present system is brought crashing down without valid ideas having been disseminated about how society can function without governmental rule people will demand a strong leader and a Hitler will rise to answer their plea

Chapter 2 Man and Society argues that the nature of man is such that he must think and produce in order to live and that in order to reach his full potential he must have the right not only to do these things but to enjoy the rewards of his productive actions It defines a laissezfaire society as one that does not institutionalize the initiation of force and in which there are means for dealing with aggression justly when it does occur It notes that only the possessor of a right can alienate himself from that right If one does 100 of damage to a taxicab for instance then he alienates himself from his right to that 100 The cabbie then has a moral right to use force to collect it

Chapter 3 The SelfRegulating Market states that state interference causes the buyer the seller or both in a transaction to lose and that only a voluntary trade can be a completely satisfactory trade It notes that markets clear that taxation is economic hemophilia regulation amounts to slow strangulation that market monopolies can only attain and maintain monopoly status through excellence and low prices and that without freedom of the market no other freedom is meaningful It criticizes the government for red tape which denies entrepreneurs opportunities to rise out of poverty

Chapter 4 Government  An Unnecessary Evil states that government is a coercive monopoly that democratic governments decide issues largely on the basis of pressure from special interest groups and that the notion of a government of laws not of men is meaningless because laws must be written and enforced by men and therefore a government of laws is a government of men It argues that the eternal vigilance which is held to be the price of liberty is a constant nonproductive expenditure of energy and that is it grossly unreasonable to expect men to keep expending their energy in such a way out of unselfish idealism It also argues that because of the danger of one interest group using the government to impose laws favoring itself or crippling its opponents people are constantly in fear of different interest groups Thus blacks fear suppression by whites whites worry about blacks gaining too much power and any number of other groups such as labor and management urbanites and suburbanites etc are pitted against each other Government is identified as a cause of strife The checks and balances of government are also recognized as a source of waste that is no substitute for external checks such as competition This chapter identifies many tools by which the government convinces people that government is necessary such as state schools that brainwash the young into accepting proState ideas investing government with tradition and pomp and identifying it with our way of life It also blames people for having a fear of selfresponsibility

Chapter 5 A Free and Healthy Economy begins by noting the difficulties people have in picturing a society radically different from their own It concludes that poverty would be better addressed by a laissezfaire society for many reasons including the fact that unemployment is caused by the government that untaxed businesses would have more profits to reinvest in productivityenhancing technology that private charities are more efficient than government that parents would be more likely to avoid having excess children in the absence of social safety nets etc It argues that a plethora of choices in education would emerge in a free market It also notes that the focus of media in a laissezfaire society would shift from covering government to covering business and individuals and that abuses would be checked by reporters looking for stories on aggression or fraud The chapter argues that the quality of health care could be more efficiently kept at an adequate level through reputation standards instituted by insurance companies etc It also discusses how currency could be provided without government

Chapter 6 Property  The Great Problem Solver argues that most social problems could be solved through an increase in the amount and type of property owned It claims that taxation is theft and that regulation by initiated force is slavery It argues that it should be possible to claim ownership over the ocean floor the surface of other planets corridors of airspace radio wavelengths and so on by being the first to occupy them or otherwise clearly stake out territory It also argues that all public property should be privatized in order to reduce crime and pollution

Chapter 7 Arbitration of Disputes argues that governmental arbiters are not necessary since a man who agrees to the settlement of disputes by a third party and then breaks the contract would suffer harm to his reputation and be ostracized thus solving the problem of noncompliance It notes that the governments judges will tend to be biased in favor of government since that is the entity from which they receive their salaries and power It promotes the concept of insurance companies as a substitute for government as the institution used to pursue claims in the event a person were defrauded they could file a claim with their insurance company and the insurer would obtain the right of subrogation Insurers who themselves committed abuses would suffer loss of reputation and be at a competitive disadvantage to more reputable insurers

Chapter 8 Protection of Life and Property asserts that a person has the right to defend his life against aggression and that he therefore has the right to defend his possessions as well since they are the results of his investment of parts of his life and are thus extensions of that life It notes Pacifism encourages every thug to continue his violent ways even though the pacifist may devoutly wish he wouldnt wishes dont create reality Pacifistic behavior teaches the aggressor that crime does pay and encourages him to more and bigger aggressions Such sanctioning of injustices is immoral and because it is immoral it is also impractical It argues that selfdefense is a personal responsibility which one can fulfill by hiring an agent to protect him such as a private defense agency It distinguishes initiated force from retaliatory force noting that the former is not a market phenomenon because it acts to destroy the market but the latter is a market phenomenon because it restrains aggressors who would destroy it andor exacts reparations from them It notes that government creates a social environment which breeds crime through its prohibitions on gambling prostitution drugs and so on It argues that the main role of police is to protect the government rather than the citizens It contrasts the police with private defense agencies which would focus on preventing aggression and whose officers would lack immunity for any offenses they might commit It also notes that insurance companies might sell policies covering the insured against loss resulting from any type of coercion and that these insurers could bring unruly defense agencies to their knees through ostracism and boycotts Yet at the same time the insurers would seek to avoid taking such action without cause since it could be costly and result in boycotts against the insurer itself

Chapter 9 Dealing with Coercion argues that punishment in the form of eye for an eye vengeance does nothing to compensate the victim and therefore opposes justice It argues that an aggressor should repay the victim for his loss and for all expenses occasioned by the aggression such as the cost of apprehending the offender It further states that when an offender could not pay the restitution for a crime in his lifetime the additional expenses could be paid by the insurance company

Chapter 10 Rectification of Injustice notes that some criminals of a particularly untrustworthy nature might need to work off their debt in workhouses To insure against refusal to work the reparations payments would be deducted from each pay before room and board costs and those who refused to work would not eat or would have only a minimal diet A variety of degrees of confinement would exist The argument that the rich would buy crime is refuted by the argument that even a wealthy man could be killed in selfdefense if he attempted a violent act and that he would risk his reputation as well

Chapter 11 Warring Defense Agencies and Organized Crime asserts the falsity of the assumption that government is necessary to prevent the initiation of force by arguing that government as a coercive monopoly must initiate force in order to survive It notes several factors that would make a private defense agency avoid aggression It would put itself at risk of retaliation and would lead its customers to fear that in the event of a fallingout it would turn its aggressive force against them Moreover insurers would consider the company to be a poor risk Its employees would also be liable for any damages they caused which would cause problems between the companies and its employees if it ordered unjustified attacks It also speculates that a mafiastyle agency would be unlikely to survive since there would be no black market to support it The chapter argues that a tyrant would have more difficulty rising to power under a system of competing private defense agencies than under a governmental system because customers oppressed by their company could simply switch to another company and obtain protection from the tyrant

Chapter 12 Legislation and Objective Law argues that free men acting in a free market would manage their affairs in accordance with natural law It calls statutory law a clumsy anachronistic and unjust hindrance It also argues that government judges have no market signals to guide their decisions in contrast to freemarket arbiters who have profit and loss as a builtin correction mechanism

Chapter 13 Foreign Aggression notes that governments obtain the resources used for defense from the people and those same resources can be used by private defense agencies to protect the people from aggression It argues that governments aggravate or threaten other governments to the point of armed conflict and then coerce their citizens into protecting them It notes that the ability of aggression insurers to pay claims would be enhanced by the limited damage resulting from the fact that foreign aggressors would need to use conventional warfare in wars of conquest to avoid destroying the property and slaves they seek to gain It notes that in a laissezfaire society there would be no government that could surrender to the enemy defenders would fight as long as they perceived it was in their best interest

Chapter 14 The Abolition of War argues that government not business is responsible for the formation of the militaryindustrial complex It notes that the burden of supporting wars falls heavily on business since taxes are taken out of the pocket of the consumer Moreover businesses are a societys producers and it is a societys producers who pay the bills Business also suffers from wars because of the disruption of trade and the ruin and poverty that result Government however gains from wars because it is left with more power more money and more territory War also helps unite the people behind the government in the face of a common enemy The authors conclude that all that is needed to abolish war is to abolish government

Chapter 15 From Government to Laissez Faire argues that first and foremost the economy should be provided with media of exchange to replace the dollar It states that possession of public property should be taken by individuals who simply by clearly marking their claims become the rightful owners It argues against disposing of public property at auction since bureaucrats would figure out ways to divert the proceeds into their own pockets and the system would be biased toward the rich many of whom obtained their wealth through political pull The process of auctioning off the property would also prolong the politicians power

Chapter 16 The Force Which Shapes the World argues that it is immoral to destroy the private property or life of an individual who has not aggressed against one It argues that violent revolution is not only destructive but actually strengthens the government It also notes that a revolutions leaders could then become the next rulers Because of the peoples desire for a leader to get them out of chaos the chapter opines that a violent revolution would pave the way for a new Hitler This chapter calls for people to share ideas related to freedom which can eventually lead to widespread noncooperation with government

Parchs group
Parchis was a 1980s childrens music group from Spain which enjoyed moderate success in countries around the world Parchis original five members were Constantino Fernndez Fernndez the red pawn Yolanda Ventura Romn the yellow pawn Oscar Ferrer Caadas the blue pawn Gemma Pratts Tremens the green pawn and David Muoz Forcada the rolling die which is singular for dice After several lineup changes the group disbanded in 1986 with various members continuing successful careers in the world of entertainment

The groups name is a reference to the board game Parcheesi translated as Parchs in Spanish where each player represents a different colored pawn red yellow blue and green In the same way each member of the group dressed in one of these four colors with the fifth member representing the dice

Parchis was created in 1979 after executives from the Belter Records company placed a newspaper ad in Barcelona asking children to attend auditions to form a musical group At first Belter Records intended to employ the group members during summers only the companys executives figured out that would be the best season of the year for Parchis albums and concerts to sell

Parchis was neither a boy or girl band Eventually the band expanded to have six members at the same time Gemma Pratts Teremens David Muoz Forcada Oscar Ferrer Caadas Constantino Fernndez Fernndez better known as Tino and Yolanda Ventura daughter of the well known trumpet player Rudy Ventura were the first five kids to be chosen as members of Parchis

Tino was the heartthrob of the group Gemma was the shy one Yolanda was every boys crush Frank who joined in 1981 after Oscar left was the extroverted red head and David a blonde haired boy was the best dancer and the life of the party

Parchis first single En La Armada was a Spanish version of the Village Peoples disco hit In the Navy En La Armada became a major hit in Spain giving way for a number of important music composers to start working with Parchis En La Armada was followed by what was arguably the groups biggest hit Durante la Espera de Parchis During Parchis Wait This song became a number one hit in Argentina Later on the group also became successful in Mexico Colombia Ecuador and other American countries

Personal problems forced Oscar Ferrer Caadas out of the band in 1981 He was substituted by Francisco Daz Terez known by fans simply as Frank Brothers Miguel ngel Gmez Cambronero born in Germany and Jess Gmez Cambronero joined the band after Tino and David left the group in 1983

Losing Tino proved lethal to the group however With Menudo reaching unprecedented for a Hispanic childrens music group success levels in Latin America as well as in Spain and other Latin American groups like Los Chamos and Los Chicos also providing Parchis with competition and with Ferrer Caadas considerable number of fans gone Parchis began to wane

In Spain and Argentina in particular however the group remained popular enough to release a 1983 movie Parchis Entra en Accin translated as Parchis Gets Into Action in English alongside Alberto Fernndez de Rosa

In 1985 Parchis broke up The group had recorded a number of albums that were successful in Spain and Latin America More than a decade later the group would reunite for one television show engagement

Today Tino is married and works as a top executive in a company Gemma is a kindergarten teacher and works as a principal in a kindergarten she owns and has a daughter named Mireia Frank is an entrepreneur and model he too is married and has a daughter named Ona Yolanda moved to Mexico to pursue a career as an actress where she had moderate success She is married and has son named Alex David earned a degree in economics and works in an investment group he created along with his school buddies He is not married All except Yolanda live in Barcelona

On February 10 2008 Parchis made an appearance on the Mexican television show Muevete It was the first time in 25 years that they were all together on the same stage They were introduced and sang the song PARCHIS with everyone in attendance Tino spoke of a comeback and wanting to sing again They were interviewed for about one hour and spoke about their romances and adventures during their tour They announced plans to tour again and come out with a new album In the opening sequence they all stood on a colored circle and the curtains came up but there was a problem with Gemmas circled curtain that didnt come up in time but she continued to sing This was the highest viewed program in Mexico for the year so far

The red pawn lead vocal in many songs and the leader of the group After his time in the group was done he tried to gain popularity as a solo artist He released three albums but with little success As an adult he worked for the company Artel During this time he lost his left arm in a car accident in the vicinity of Murcia He currently resides in Barcelona where he is a radio sports commentator He is married with no children

The yellow pawn and every boys crush She is the daughter of the famous Spanish musician Rudy Ventura After her time in Parchis Yolanda eventually began a career in acting starting off with television shows in Spain soon making her way to Mexico where she lives and works exclusively for Televisa She married actor Alejandro Aragon and has a son with the same name The marriage ended and she now maintains a relationship with fellow actor Odiseo Bichir

The green pawn and the shyest member of the group Eventually went on to study childcare and ran a kindergarten in Barcelona She is now working as a clerk and is married with a daughter

The white die and the groups dancer He was said to have been chosen for the group because dancing came so easily to him After Parchis he went to Scotland to study economics and currently works for an advertisement company He is married and lives in the United States

The blue pawn the smallest group member and the first one to leave Theres never been a clear reason behind his departure As an adult he graduated with a degree in journalism and political science He now works as a marketing manager in a communication group He is married

The blue pawn Oscars replacement and the extroverted red head Despite his young age joining the group Frank already had experience as an advertising model Mistakenly he is often referred to as an original member He continued on with music even after leaving Parchis and started his own rock band He is now an entrepreneur and has a wife and daughter

The red pawn and Tinos replacement as the groups leader which proved to be a difficult task After Parchis he continued on in the world of music and formed a band called Platn with his brother Michel

The white die Davids replacement and the last new member to join Michel joined so late in the group he had to learn many of the groups dance moves on the plane to their next destination just hours before their next show After Parchis he and his brother Chus formed the group Platn in 1992

New York Air Brake
The New York Air Brake Corporation located in Watertown New York is a manufacturer of air brake and train control systems for the railroad industry worldwide

New York Air Brake was established on July 1 1890 acquiring all of the property and business of Eames Vacuum Brake Company Eames Vacuume Brake Company had previously been in existence since 1876 manufacturing vacuum brakes The new company erected ten new buildings on Beebee Island and nearby shores just in time for a booming brake market driven by an 1893 law mandating standardized brakes for all railroad cars

In 1902 NYAB bought the Poole Farm in Watertown NY and began its move to its present location The new Works were planned as a model industrial enterprise providing housing work and recreation for 1000 employees on the grounds The workers however decided that they did not want to live next door to their workplace and the plan was scrapped In 1903 the new foundry became the first part of the new plant to begin operations

During this period NYABs main competition was Westinghouse Air Brake Company which lead the market in locomotive braking sales Despite Westinghouses lead American railroads preferred to have two brake suppliers James Hill builder of the Great Northern Railway and the New York Central Railroad were especially supportive of New York Air Brakes technology In 1912 NYAB and Westinghouse agreed to share the market along with research and development NYABs 25 percent share of the brake market soared to 3 million per year by 1914

In 1915 NYAB shifted focus of their current manufacturing of vacuum brakes to efforts toward the First World War Sales grew from 47 million in 1915 to 24 million in 1916 By 1918 the company employed 7000 who were involved in defense manufacturing including the production of horsedrawn cannons

After World War I it was decided that a new braking system needed to be developed to provide braking power for the ever growing freight train industry Engineers at New York Air Brake contributed to the development of what came to be known as the AB brake During the mid1930s at the same time the AB brake was being widely implemented the pneumatic and electropneumatic braking equipment for modern highspeed locomotives and passenger trains were engineered and produced at the Watertown facilities

A dramatic drop in sales following the end of World War I led New York Air Brake to seek new markets In 1919 the company built and marketed a ThreePoint Truck an enormous affair the four wheels alone weighing nearly one ton The machine had a wheelbase and an overall length of  It weighed about 8100 pounds and had a carrying capacity of from three to six tons It was not a success

In 1925 new management announced another try at the auto industry with the introduction of the Gerlinger hydraulic lumber carrier an engine and a cab set high atop a lumber rack The project faded quickly

Westinghouse and New York Air Brake began development of a replacement for the venerable K Brake in 1929 The Great Depression slowed but did not stop development of the new brake and in April 1932 New York Air Brake began construction of a 200car test track the largest in the world In 1934 the Association of American Railroads AAR voted to adopt the new composite AB brake Despite the Depression the company maintained employment for 300 workers many on a parttime basis

In 1945 New York Air Brake again returned to aiding the United States war effort in World War II Up until the end of the war NYAB became a producer of tank hulls for the Sherman tank antiaircraft shells automatic pilots for aircraft breech mechanisms for guns hydraulic pumps for fighter aircraft and other military hardware and had over 5000 employees contributing to the war effort in the wartorn Europe by the end of 1944

By the end of the Second World War New York Air Brake had expanded its product line to include hydraulic aircraft pumps In 1949 the company furthered its market reach with the purchase of the Hydraulic Equipment Company Dudco Products Company As a result sales leapt from 18 million in 1950 to more than 45 million in 1957

On June 15 1967 NYAB merged with General Signal Corporation In 1980 Congress passed the Staggers Act which deregulated the railroad industry As a result of the ending of tax breaks for railroad car ownership new car and brake orders plummeted from 96000 in 1979 to 5800 in 1983 In November 1982 the company put into effect a series of workforce cutbacks that enabled NYAB to survive this difficult time

Meantime in 1972 New York Air Brakes lobbying in Albany NY landed a trial run with the New York City transit system The company was allowed to equip one eight car R44 train numbers 368379 with one spare four car set of brakes each making it a total of 12 cars equipped with same One troublefree year later New York Air Brake signed a 25 million contract to provide brake systems and controls for New York transits entire fleet of 754 R46 subway cars the beginning of over a decade of providing brakes to commuter lines By 1990 New York Air Brake had furnished 100 million worth of equipment for more than half of New York Citys R62As R68s and R110AR110B subway cars before NYABs Transit Division was established as the Knorr Brake Company and moved to Westminster Maryland

On January 2 1991 KnorrBremse acquired New York Air Brakes rail braking business from General Signal however they did not purchase Stratopower or Dynapower KnorrBremse is a maker of braking systems for rail and truck vehicles

By the end of 1993 NYAB stopped manufacturing the Westinghouse brake in favor of KnorrBremses improved DB60 air brake featuring poppet valve technology Consolidation of operations into one building tax abatements and state funding kept the company in Watertown

Since its acquisition NYAB has modernized under KnorrBremse creating the most technologically advanced rail brake manufacturing facility in North America

At the end of 2009 NYAB operations included Train Dynamic Systems TDS in Irving Texas Knorr Brake Limited in Kingston Ontario a brake shoe manufacturer a brake hose manufacturer and two Service Centers in Little Rock Arkansas and Riverside Kansas City Missouri

KBXD
KBXD 1480 kHz is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Dallas Texas The station features a Hindi hit music radio format for the DallasFort Worth Metroplex South Asian community It calls itself Radio Salaam Namaste KBXDs broadcast license is held by Hammond Broadcasting Group LLC

In recent years the station got a boost in daytime power to 50000 watts the maximum for AM stations It reduces power at night to 1900 watts to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1480 The transmitter is off of South Saint Augustine Road in Dallas

The station now known as KBXD signed on as KGKO on January 1953 The station played pop music and jazz In 1958 KGKO changed its call sign to KBOX and it adopted a Top 40 format to compete with Gordon McLendons toprated 1190 KLIF Future WABC disc jockey Dan Ingram was an early voice on KBOX Within a year the station known variously as Wonderful KBox in Dallas Big Top Radio and Tiger Radio had rocketed from the bottom of the ratings to a neartie with KLIF and remained highly rated through the coming decade KBox was the only radio station covering President John F Kennedys motorcade live when he was assassinated on November 22 1963 Although KLIF was widely acclaimed for its later coverage of the Presidents death and the ensuing events it was not broadcasting live from the motorcade route

KBOX put an FM station on the air at 1003 MHz on Christmas Day 1965 KBOXFM mostly simulcast KBOX AM 1480 It later took a beautiful music format as KMEZFM and today is KJKK

Group One Broadcasting of Texas acquired KBOX from Balaban Broadcasting in 1967 for 2 million

KBOX had never been able to defeat KLIF in the Top 40 arena So on January 24 1967 KBOX changed direction and went to a country format The first song played on the new country KBOX was Ive Got a Tiger By the Tail by Buck Owens a nod to the stations former Tiger Radio moniker

KPCN 730 AM now KKDA was the first country station in the area having started in 1962 but it broadcast during the daytime only KBOX quickly became the ratings leader for country music in Dallas In its first ratings book it moved from a 100 share Q3 1966 to a 121 share in Q1 1967 KBOX had six years of solid ratings posting a high of 144 in the Q3 1967 book In 1972 820 WBAP began giving KBOX stiff competition as a countryformatted 50000watt powerhouse WBAP gained many listeners from KBOX

In 1973 the Arbitron markets for Dallas and Fort Worth were combined into one book to reflect the merging of the two cities into one metropolitan area KBOX like other smaller stations was hurt by this redefinition Some like KBOX did not even appear in the new ratings book WBAP became the clear country winner at that point as KBOX barely reached the Ft Worth half of the newly defined market

In April 1974 Group One applied for a nighttime power increase from 500 watts to 1 kilowatt and a move of the transmitter site to 32 52 15 N 96 42 54 W The Federal Communications Commission approved it in February 1975 This gave KBOX a better signal which is probably what allowed it to struggle into the 1980s providing a more local service to Dallas since WBAP is licensed to Fort Worth But by 1980 FM radio was growing in dominance and the ability of KBOX to compete with a music format was waning

On November 14 1982 the KBOX call letters were dropped by Group One KBOX became KMEZ and switched from its country format to a simulcast of the easy listening format of sister station KMEZFM

In 1989 KMEZAM broke away from the FM station to adopt a Business NewsTalk format as KDBN This was followed in 1991 by the satellitefed Stardust Adult Standards service from the Unistar Radio Network as KCMZ

Marcos A Rodriguez purchased the station and changed the format to Spanishlanguage Banda music with call sign KMRT 19931998 Marcos A Rodriguez picked the calls to connote the retailer KMart and imply good value for advertisers KMRT was the first radio station in America to air the Banda format all the time It operated with an automated Audio Server delivery

Eventually the call sign changed to KDXX 19982002 and KHCK 19982005 a simulcast of Tejano KHCKFM Kick FM until the FM changed format to Cumbia music as KFZO and the AM continued as a standalone Tejano station for a few months The KNIT call letters and a Southern Gospel format were adopted in March 2005 when it was briefly owned by Salem Communications

In June 2007 the station joined the Spanish language sports network ESPN Deportes Radio and it was the first ESPN Deportes station to be managed and operated by ESPN 1540 KZMP picked up the ESPN Deportes format on June 1 2009 almost two years after the format was first aired in the DallasFort Worth area The Deportes format was dropped by 1480 in August 2009

KBXD along with coowned stations WFLL WFTL and WMEN was purchased out of bankruptcy by Mark Jorgensons ACM JCE IV B LLC in a transaction that was consummated on August 6 2015 at a purchase price of 55 million A proposed sale to Chris Muse for 15 million on May 13 2016 plus a 13000 payment to break the stations tower lease was terminated without closing The transmitting site was acquired from Salem Radio Properties KBXD switched its format to South Asian pop music In April 2017 the station suspended all programming and started running a continuous advertisement asking the listener If you are interested in renting this radio station call John Hammond at The station is not transmitting a legal ID as required by the FCC As of mid June 2017 the station is playing Hispanic music with station breaks in Spanish

Effective August 11 2017 ACM sold KBXD to Hammond Broadcasting Group LLC for 600000

But as Israels functions included the civil control of the Jews and especially the collection of the taxes the German rabbis opposed his appointment Some of them even threatened him with excommunication in case he did not resign The emperor upon hearing of this confirmed Israels appointment as chief rabbi by a second decree November 23 1407 imposing a fine of twenty gold marks on any one refusing to submit to him But the edicts had little effect and the office of the chief rabbi became obsolete soon after its creation No further mention of Israel occurs until 1415 when he is mentioned in a document of Emperor Sigismund appointing him to superintend the collection of the Jewish taxes in which office he was the subordinate of the hereditary chamberlain Conrad of Weinsberg

Last Child
Last Child is a song by American rock band Aerosmith It was written by Steven Tyler and Brad Whitford and released as the first single from the album Rocks in 1976 It peaked at 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 one of a string of hits for the band in the mid1970s

The song is one of Brad Whitfords bestknown contributions to the band Brad wrote Take me back to sweet Tallahassee home sweet home recalled Tyler Whatever he put into Last Child thats his moment He can take that and thats his forever

Live Whitford plays a variation of the guitar solo as heard on the original recording The song opens like a slow song with careful playing of the guitar and Tylers dreamy lyrics After 22 seconds it abruptly changes to a hard rocking bluesy song complete with a boogie background and twoguitar interplay between Whitford and Joe Perry with Whitford playing the low notes of the riff on the verse and Perry playing funk chords higher up the neck

Long after its release Last Child enjoys regular airplay on rock radio and is regularly rotated into Aerosmiths concert setlist In concert it is often Whitfords feature spot in which Tyler introduces him with something like Brad Whitford what do you got to show for yourself or What do you got up your sleeve Whitford often does a little bit of an intro before playing the opening notes to the song

Although it was often assumed that the guitar solo as heard on the studio recording was played by Joe Perry it was originally rumored to have been played by an uncited hired guitarist During his appearance as a guest on That Metal Show in 2012 Whitford stated that he actually wrote and performed the solo himself

Last Child has been rereleased on compilations including Aerosmiths Greatest Hits O Yeah Ultimate Aerosmith Hits and  as well as live collections including Live Bootleg Classics Live II and A Little South of Sanity

The song is one of Aerosmiths most funkbased tracks modeled after the band The Meters

Mickey Thomas Earl Slick Nathan East and Steve Ferrone covered the song for the Aerosmith tribute album Not the Same Old Song and Dance Eagle Records 1999

A cover version of this song appears in the game Guitar Hero II The cover is based on the live version from A Little South of Sanity

Swedish realism
Swedish realism is the period in Swedish literature that encompassed the last two decades of the 19th century It is generally considered to have ended in the 1910s but the exact year is a matter of debate

August Strindberg 18491912 was a writer worldfamous for his dramas and prose noted for his exceptional talent and complex intellect In 1879 he published The Red Room Rda Rummet which brought him immediate fame The Red Room was a satirical novel that relentlessly attacked the political the academic the philosophical and the religious worlds

After several harsh disputes Strindberg left Sweden in 1883 In 1884 he briefly returned to Stockholm to stand trial in a blasphemy case against his collection of short stories Married Giftas He was acquitted but the trial sparked a psychological turmoil that lasted for some 10 years during which he wrote some of his internationally best known works the selfexaminatory Tjnstekvinnans son 188687 En dres frsvarstal 188787 and also plays Fadren Frken Julie and Mster Olof 188688

In 1897 Strindberg engaged himself in occultism in particular alchemy leading to a mental breakdown known as his Infernocrisis The following year 1897 Strindberg moved back to Sweden and settled in the city Lund There he resurrected his literary production by publishing Inferno

In 1898 Strindberg moved back to Stockholm He continued writing but also engaged himself energetically in debates in a wide range of subjects His most notable writings during this period were his dramas such as The Dance of Death 1900 and A Dream Play 1901

The Swedish 1890s is noted for its poetic neoromanticism a reaction to the sociorealistic literature of the 1880s The first literary key figure to emerge was Verner von Heidenstam 18591940 and his literary debut in 1887 with the collection of poetry Vallfart och vandringsr Pilgrimage and WanderYears
Selma Lagerlf 18581940 was the arguably brightest star of the 1890s and her impression has lasted up to modern times She wrote several highly regarded works which are still among the toplists on Swedish libraries such as Gsta Berlings saga 1891 an epic tale of the unmoral Gsta Berling who gets haunted by the Devil and The Wonderful Adventures of Nils 19061907 a geographical adventure of Nils who travels Sweden on the back of a goose Lagerlf was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1909 for the imagination and spiritual perception that characterized her writings

Gustaf Frding 18601911 was another key figure of the 1890s His active literary period only spanned between 18911898 because of mental problems Frding was above all renowned for his flowing poetry His popularity was at first based on his bubbling sense of humor and free treatment of the poetic verse but later readers also found in it a profound humanism and imaginative depth

Erik Axel Karlfeldt 18641931 was like Frding a depictor of rural life in his native province in Karlfeldts case Dalarna His poetry had the intention of sparking a cultural identity within Dalarna and spoke warmly of traditions family values and so on Although his poetry was narrow Karlfeldt was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931 posthumously possibly as a result of internal politics within the Swedish Academy

<doc id="7699598" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699598" title="Rosi Braidotti">
Rosi Braidotti
Rosi Braidotti  born 28 September 1954 is a contemporary philosopher and feminist theoretician

Braidotti who holds Italian and Australian citizenship was born in Italy and grew up in Australia where she received degrees from the Australian National University in Canberra in 1977 and was awarded the University Medal in Philosophy and the University Tillyard prize Braidotti then moved on to do her doctoral work at the Sorbonne where she received her degree in philosophy in 1981 She has taught at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands since 1988 when she was appointed as the founding professor in womens studies In 1995 she became the founding Director of the Netherlands research school of Womens Studies a position she held till 2005

Braidotti is a pioneer in European Womens Studies she founded the interuniversity SOCRATES network NOISE and the Thematic Network for Womens Studies ATHENA which she directed till 2005 She was a Leverhulme Trust Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College in 20056 a Jean Monnet professor at the European University Institute in Florence in 20023 and a fellow in the school of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in 1994 She is a founding member of the European Consortium for Humanities Institutes and Centres ECHIC 2008 in 2010 she was elected member of the Board of the Consortium Humanities Centres and Institutes CHCI and in 2014 a member of the Scientific Council of the Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique in France Braidotti was the founding Director of the Centre for the Humanities at Utrecht University 20072016 and is currently Distinguished University Professor at Utrecht University

Braidotti serves or has served on the advisory board of many academic feminist journals including differences Signs Womens Studies International Forum and Feminist Formations

Braidottis publications have consistently been placed in continental philosophy at the intersection with social and political theory cultural politics gender feminist theory and ethnicity studies The core of her interdisciplinary work consists of four interconnected monographs on the constitution of contemporary subjectivity with special emphasis on the concept of difference within the history of European philosophy and political theory Braidottis philosophical project investigates how to think difference positively which means moving beyond the dialectics that both opposes it and thus links it by negation to the notion of sameness

This is evidenced in the philosophical agenda set in her first book Patterns of Dissonance An Essay on Women in Contemporary French Philosophy 1991 which gets developed further in the trilogy that follows In the next book Nomadic Subjects Embodiment and Difference in Contemporary Feminist Theory 1994 the question is formulated in more concrete terms can gender ethnic cultural or European differences be understood outside the straitjacket of hierarchy and binary opposition Thus the following volume Metamorphoses Towards a Materialist Theory of Becoming 2002 analyses not only gender differences but also more categorical binary distinctions between self and other European and foreign human and nonhuman animal environmental technological others

The conclusion is that a systematic ambivalence structures contemporary cultural representations of the globalised technologically mediated ethnically mixed genderaware world we now inhabit The question consequently arises of what it takes to produce adequate cultural and political representations of a fastchanging world and move closer to Spinozian notions of adequate understanding

The ethical dimension of Braidottis work on difference comes to the fore in the last volume of the trilogy Transpositions On Nomadic Ethics 2006 Here she surveys the different ethical approaches that can be produced by taking difference and diversity as the main point of reference and conclude that there is much to be gained by suspending belief that political participation moral empathy and social cohesion can only be produced on the basis of the notion of recognition of sameness

Braidotti makes a case for an alternative view on subjectivity ethics and emancipation and pitches diversity against the postmodernist risk of cultural relativism while also standing against the tenets of liberal individualism Throughout her work Braidotti asserts and demonstrates the importance of combining theoretical concerns with a serious commitment to producing socially and politically relevant scholarship that contributes to making a difference in the world Braidottis output also included several edited volumes Her work has been translated in a total of 19 languages and all the main books in at least three languages other than English

Her most recent book is The Posthuman Polity Press 2013 The Posthuman offers both an introduction and major contribution to contemporary debates on the posthuman As the traditional distinction between the human and its others has blurred exposing the nonnaturalistic structure of the human The Posthuman starts by exploring the extent to which a posthumanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject Rather than perceiving this situation as a loss of cognitive and moral selfmastery Braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities

Braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of postanthropocentric thought which encompass not only other species but also the sustainability of our planet as a whole Because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives they result in hybridization erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species seeds plants animals and bacteria These dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable a critique of anthropocentrism but how reliable are they as indicators of a sustainable future

The Posthuman concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities Braidotti outlines new forms of cosmopolitan neohumanism that emerge from the spectrum of postcolonial and race studies as well as gender analysis and environmentalism The challenge of the posthuman condition consists in seizing the opportunities for new social bonding and community building while pursuing sustainability and empowerment

In 2011 Braidotti published two new books the renewed and revised edition of Nomadic Subjects and collection of essays Nomadic Theory The Portable Rosi Braidotti The collection provides a core introduction to Braidottis nomadic theory and its innovative formulations which engage with Gilles Deleuze Michel Foucault Luce Irigaray and a host of political and cultural issues Arranged thematically essays begin with such concepts as sexual difference and embodied subjectivity and follow with explorations in technoscience feminism postsecular citizenship and the politics of affirmation

Influenced by philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze and especially French feminist thinker Luce Irigaray Braidotti has brought postmodern feminism into the Information Age with her considerations of cyberspace prosthesis and the materiality of difference Braidotti also considers how ideas of gender difference can affect our sense of the humananimal and humanmachine divides Braidotti has also pioneered European perspectives in feminist philosophy and practice and has been influential on thirdwave as well as postsecular feminisms

On 3 March 2005 Braidotti was honored with a Royal Knighthood from Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in August 2006 she received the University Medal from the University of d in Poland and she was awarded an Honorary Degree in Philosophy from Helsinki University in May 2007 In 2009 she was elected Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities Since 2009 she is a board member of CHCIConsortium of Humanities Centre and Institutes In 2013 she received an Honorary Degree in Philosophy from Linkping University in Sweden

Hakuna Matata song
Hakuna Matata is a song from Disneys 32nd animated feature The Lion King The music was written by Elton John with lyrics by Tim Rice The song is based on Timon and Pumbaas catchphrase in the movie Hakuna matata which is a Swahili phrase it means no worries It is characterized by its simple 44 time upbeat message and catchy lyrics

The musical score was composed by Elton John with lyrics by Tim Rice In the film the song is sung by Timon a meerkat voiced by Nathan Lane Pumbaa a warthog voiced by Ernie Sabella and Simba a young lion voiced by Jason Weaver singing voice as a cub and Joseph Williams as an adult Taking place after the death of Mufasa it features Timon and Pumbaa the two main comedy characters in the film talking to Simba about moving forward from their troubled pasts and forgetting their worries and Simba grows from cub to adult as the song progresses The song also provides a backstory for Pumbaa explaining that he was ostracized from animal society for his excessive flatulence It makes use of a large proportion of the orchestra as well as many other more unusual instruments including an elaborate drum kit Rice is said to have got the idea for the lyrics for the song from watching the comedy series Bottom and at one point wanted the shows stars Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson to play Timon and Pumbaa

A second version of the song produced for the companion album Rhythm of the Pride Lands was performed by Jimmy Cliff featuring Lebo M This version has a slightly modified previously unreleased verse focusing on Timons past It was partially rewritten with a different instrument arrangement but remains very similar to the original This version of the song was released as a single with He Lives in You as a Bside and was ultimately used in the Broadway theatrical version of The Lion King

The song was based on an earlier song written early on in the production stage called Warthog Rhapsody Although the two songs shared the same message and position in the film when Elton and Tim began to work on the music the song was completely rewritten and it eventually evolved into Hakuna Matata Warthog Rhapsody was eventually reproduced and released on Rhythm of the Pride Lands
The melody of Warthog Rhaspody was used in The Lion King 1 for the song Thats All I Need

Hakuna matata is a phrase in Swahili that is frequently translated as no worries In a bonus features of The Lion King Special Edition DVD the films production team claims that it picked up the term from a tour guide while on safari in Kenya It was then developed into an ideology that along with the seemingly antithetical value of duty to the monarchy is central to the moral content of the film

The title phrase is pronounced with American English phonology within the song including a flapped t rather than as it is pronounced in Swahili

The song became enormously popular and was nominated for Best Song at the 67th Academy Awards but lost to Can You Feel the Love Tonight one of three Lion King song nominations the third one was Circle of Life It was also ranked 99th in the AFIs list of the 100 best American movie songs of all time Disneys seventh and last entry of songs on the list the others being When You Wish Upon a Star from Pinocchio at 7 Some Day My Prince Will Come from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs at 19 Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious from Mary Poppins at 36 Wind Beneath My Wings from Beaches at 44 ZipADeeDooDah from Song of the South at 47 and Beauty and the Beast from Beauty and the Beast at 62

A shortened version of Hakuna Matata was used as the theme song of the spinoff Timon  Pumbaa TV show

Another shortened version of Hakuna Matata was also used on the TV series The Lion Guard in the firstseason episode Bunga and the King 2016 and was sung by the characters of the show

Complete Mage
Complete Mage is a supplemental rule book for the 35 edition of the Dungeons  Dragons roleplaying game It is effectively the sequel to Complete Arcane

The book provides feats prestige classes and other options for characters interested in magic Unlike Complete Arcane Complete Mage contains no new core classes but it contains alternative class features for existing classes

Complete Mage adds 13 new alternative class features

Rangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is and more with what it does These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals

Every swashbuckler relies on her agility and quick wit to get her out of scrapes Some take this a step farther learning magical tricks that boost their mobility or defense

Rare is the fighter who hasnt envied the wizards bag of magical tricks Although even the most basic arcane spell remains beyond a fighters abilities those who aspire to such talents can with practice learn to cast simple arcane spells while wearing light armor On its own this alternative feature grants little benefit to a singleclassed fighter only in conjunction with one or more levels of sorcerer wizard or a similar arcane spellcasting class does this ability come into play

Most paladins use their divinely granted powers to combat diseases that plague their allies Paladins with an interest in the arcane particularly those who battle necromancers sometimes prefer to learn to counteract the effects of magical curses

Although the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic some clerics and paladins find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge

Deities influence the world through the divine spells they grant their worshipers Some clerics however choose to explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided by the gods By giving up some of their divine power these clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities

Every druid reveres nature but some pay more respect to the fundamental building blocks of the natural world than to its flora and fauna By forgoing her bond with the animal kingdom a druid can instead take on an elemental creature as her companion

Every wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus

The traditional monk seeks balance in body mind and soul and through this equilibrium gains various combat talents A monk who learns the secret of the soulwarp strike masters an arcane talent of necromancy that infects her enemys ki producing an effect akin to terrible sickness

Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy It takes only a little training however to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator

Most barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap Some however finetune this ability to focus on magical attacks granting them the ability to dodge the orbs rays and eldritch blasts of their enemies

Bards pride themselves on being masters of language and sound A rare few learn to use their voices to interfere with enemy spellcasters twisting word and sound to defeat spells before they are cast

Most sorcerers hide behind walls of steel slinging spells at enemies safely distant You have no patience for such cowards and prefer to be near the front line Your breadth of magical knowledge might not compare with those craven weaklings but you are proud to dive into the fray alongside the fighter

Complete Mage was written by Skip Williams Penny Williams Ari Marmell and Kolja Raven Liquette and was published in October 2006 Cover art was by Matt Cavotta and interior art is by Miguel Coimbra Eric Deschamps Wayne England Carl Frank Randy Gallegos Ralph Horsley Jim Nelson Eric Polak Mike Schley Ron Spencer Anne Stokes Arnie Swekel Eva Widermann and Kieran Yanner

Andy Collins explains how this book relates to Complete Arcane Both books cover similar topicshow to enhance your characters magical arcane abilities That said they dont follow exactly the same format though both contain spells feats and prestige classes as one might expect so the range of subject matter varies a bit Complete Mage for example doesnt introduce new classes like Complete Arcane did though it does provide some new options feats spells and so on for the new classes from Complete Arcane

Shannon Appelcline identified Complete Mage as one of the books that changed the way that DD worked in dramatic ways and may have influenced the design of 4th edition DD

Death of Michael Stewart
Michael Jerome Stewart May 9 1958 Brooklyn New York  September 28 1983 Manhattan New York was an AfricanAmerican man who received recognition after his death following an arrest by New York City Transit Police for spraypainting graffiti on a New York City Subway wall at the First Avenue station His treatment while in police custody and the ensuing trials of the arresting officers all of whom were acquitted sparked debate concerning police brutality and the responsibilities of arresting officials in handling suspects This was a widely publicized episode in New York Citys history of police brutality cases

Word of the arrest came out on September 15 1983 as the Committee Against Racially Motivated Police Violence was holding a news conference to publicize a United States Congress hearing into complaints of police abuse Stewart had been arrested earlier that day He died at age 25 on September 28 after 13 days in a coma The cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest

At 250 am on September 15 1983 graffiti artist Michael Stewart was arrested for spraying graffiti at the First Avenue station on the Brooklynbound platform Transit Police Officer John Kostick found Stewart scrawling RQS on the wall and had him arrested Stewart allegedly said Hey man you got me Kostick cuffed Stewart and walked him to the turnstile to be identified As Stewart was still living with his parents he asked the police not to call his home to wake them up Officer Kostick claimed Stewart was initially cordial but suddenly ran off and had to be restrained while waiting for the arrest transport van At the top of the stairs Stewart fell faceforward on the ground said Kostick The officer held Stewart to the ground until the van arrived where several officers put him inside Stewart was taken to the District 4 Transit Police station at 14th StreetUnion Square two stops away

While being taken to the station Kostick said Stewart became very violent in the van Stewart struggled with the officers and ran to the street He was beaten unconscious He was hogtied bound at the ankles and tethered handstofeet by an elastic strap During the struggle Stewarts wails could be heard by 27 Parsons School of Design students from their dorm windows A Parsons student Rebecca Reiss heard Stewart say Oh my God someone help me and What did I do What did I do He was booked at the Union Square District 4 transit police headquarters for resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marijuana The transit police supervisors deemed Stewart emotionally disturbed Stewart was placed back into the van and transported to Bellevue Hospital to undergo psychiatric observation Stewart arrived at Bellevue at 322 am He was handcuffed his legs were bound and he was comatose with a blood alcohol content of 022 more than double the 010 threshold needed to arrest someone for drunk driving Stewart was dating Suzanne Mallouk at the time She went with Stewarts family to see him at the hospital According to their account he had bruises and cuts on his body The doctors confirmed he was brain dead and had hemorrhaged in a way that suggested he had either been choked or strangled Stewart died on September 28 1983 thirteen days after his arrest

In charge of determining Stewarts cause of death was the citys medical examiner Dr Elliot M Gross Gross had three separate findings He first declared Stewart had died due to excessive drinking alcohol poisoning which led to the coma and subsequent heart attack thus the police were not at fault Stewarts family and advocates were unconvinced and believed this was a classic coverup In a second autopsy conducted a month later Gross declared that Stewart had died from a spinal cord injury in the upper neck In his third assessment he said that Stewart died from bluntforce trauma According to The New York Times Gross declined to specify what caused the injury explaining only that there are a number of possibilities as to how an injury of these type can occur He refused to talk to press unless testifying before the grand jury Gross said Stewarts injuries including the facial bruising and the abrasions on his wrists sustained during his arrest were not said to contribute to his death Nurses said his hands and face were blue when he arrived at the hospital and that it took 3 minutes to remove the cuffs They also said that he had been beaten brutally

Stewarts family doctors contradict what was in the final autopsy report done by Gross Doctors hired by Stewarts family to perform a secondary autopsy found his cause of death to be strangulation Dr Gross said there were no evidence of strangulation Critical information such as Stewarts eyes were removed and held by Gross and were not allowed to be studied by the doctors hired by Stewarts family His eyes were crucial because they would have shown evidence of hemorrhaging due to lack of oxygen from being strangled Gross incompetence led the Stewart family to call for a petition to remove him as chief medical examiner claiming alleged wrongdoing and the medical examiners office cannot be trusted with the safekeeping of items Following the trial all six policemen were acquitted of criminal charges Dr Gross was later fired and Stewarts parents were compensated 17 million for their childs death Stewarts death would be remembered as an egregious tragedy of police abuse

A grand jury investigation was initiated in October 1983 to determine what happened to Stewart in the 32 minutes between being arrested and his delivery to the hospital On October 19 about twenty black community leaders including City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney Robert M Morgenthaus office at the Criminal Court Building Morgenthau refused to see the group stating that it would be inappropriate to comment before the case went to the grand jury in November 1983 The medical examiners final report issued on November 2 differed from his preliminary report Gross declined to state explicitly what caused the death but reported that Stewart died of physical injury to the spinal cord in the upper neck and concluded that there were a number of possibilities as to how an injury of this type can occur

During the fivemonth trial in the New York Supreme Court some witnesses testified that Stewart was struck and kicked by officers while other witnesses said they did not see officers beat Stewart None were able to determine who was responsible for handling Stewart and none were able to identify which officers took which actions at the arrest Experts could not agree on what combination of injuries intoxication and cardiac health issues ended Stewarts life Seven months into the grand jury investigation the case was dismissed because a juror Ronald P Fields initiated private investigations on the case

In February 1984 a second grand jury introduced the case before Justice George F Roberts which indicted three officers John Kostick Anthony Piscola and Henry Boerner with criminally negligent homicide assault and perjury Three other officers Sgt Henry Hassler Sgt James Barry and Susan Techky who denied that they saw officers kick Stewart were charged with perjury In June 1985 jury selection began in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for the trial

Prosecutor Morgenthau went to the second trial with two theories one of neck injury leading to the death and the other that beatings caused cardiac arrest Prosecutors pushed for second degree manslaughter to be charged if it was determined the officers recklessly caused the death The jury was instructed that to support a charge of criminally negligent homicide they had to find that the officers failed to take reasonable steps to prevent death The prosecution hoped to establish a law requiring officers to have an affirmative duty to protect prisoners in their custody from abuse

William McKechnie of the Transit Patrolmans Benevolent Association denied the officers role in the death stating If someone dies of a heart attack we are not doctors The New York Civil Liberties Union believed the second set of indictments signaled a new direction in how prosecutors treat police abuse cases Richard Emery a lawyer for the New York City Liberties Union stated The theory underlining this case is perhaps the most important development in stemming the tide of police abuse It makes police officers strictly responsible for their prisoners It holds them accountable On November 24 1985 the six officers were acquitted by an allwhite jury

In 1987 the 11 officers and the MTA were charged with a 40 million civil suit filed by the Stewart family which prompted hundreds of off duty transit police officers to march along Madison Avenue in front of the MTAs headquarters carrying signs reading End the witch hunt and When are we finally innocent In August 1990 Stewarts parents and his siblings John and Lisha Cole Stewart settled the civil suit out of court for 17 million As of 1990 the police and city officials stated they were not to blame for the death of Michael Stewart

Family  Stewarts family called death an act of racism and brutality Attorneys representing the Stewart family described Michael as a retiring and almost docile 135pound young artist and a Pratt Institute student who was on his way home to his Clinton Hill Brooklyn neighborhood where he lived with his mother Carrie and father Millard who was a retired Metropolitan Transit Authority maintenance worker They maintained that the white officers had beaten a black artist and model It stirred public protests by black activists and others believing that city officials are covering up for the transit police

MTA  In March 1987 the MTA determined that only one officer John Kostick was subject to suspension based on departmental charges of perjury The MTA Board approved additional training for transit officers in the handling of emotionally disturbed people and changed its policies on how the departments internal affairs unit becomes involved with cases of possible misconduct

Christine of France
Christine of France 10 February 1606  27 December 1663 was the sister of Louis XIII and the Duchess of Savoy by marriage At the death of her husband Victor Amadeus I in 1637 she acted as regent of Savoy between 1637 and 1648

Christine was born in the Palais du Louvre in Paris she was the third child and second daughter of King Henry IV of France and his second wife the Italian Marie de Medici As a daughter of the king she was a Daughter of France She was a younger sister of Louis XIII of France and Elisabeth of France She was also an older sister of Nicholas Henri Duke of Orlans Gaston Duke of Orlans and Henrietta Maria of France Christine was a sisterinlaw of Philip IV of Spain through lisabeth and of Charles I of England through Henrietta Maria As a child she was raised under the supervision of the royal governess Franoise de Montglat

After the marriage of her older sister Elisabeth in 1615 to the future Philip IV of Spain Christine took on the honorary title of Madame Royale indicating her status as the eldest and most senior unmarried daughter at the court of her father After her marriage the style went to her younger sister Henrietta Maria of France

She married Victor Amadeus I Duke of Savoy on 10 February 1619 at the Louvre in the capital From 1619 till her husbands accession she was known as the Princess of Piedmont He was a son of Charles Emmanuel I Duke of Savoy and Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain Caterina Micaela was in turn a daughter of Philip II of Spain and Elisabeth of Valois Elisabeth was a daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de Medici She was said to be volatile and frivolous Educated at the French court she introduced French culture to the court of Savoy she later lived at the Palazzo Madama which she had rebuilt She was also the driving force for the reconstruction of the Castello del Valentino as well as the additions to the Royal Palace of Turin She would also later own Vigna di Madama Reale old residence of her brother in law Maurice of Savoy

She did as much as she could to ensure that her court rivalled in splendour that of her sister Henrietta Maria wife of Charles I of England The sisters would have somewhat of a rivalry In spite of this the two sisters maintained an avid correspondence throughout their life which showed their close relationship She was a confidant to the exiled Queen Henrietta who often wrote to her about her experiences during the English Civil War and her sons restoration Christine encouraged her husband to claim his right to the rather empty title of King of Cyprus and Jerusalem a kingdom which led to him being tagged as a king without a crown She did not keep it a secret that she would rather be a queen than a duchess she also wanted to transform the minor Duchy of Savoy into a little France

Victor Amadeus became Duke after the death of his father on 26 July 1630 When her husband died in 1637 she was created regent in the name of her son Francis Hyacinth At the death of Francis Hyacinth in 1638 her second son Charles Emmanuel II succeeded and Christine retained the regency Both Prince Maurice and his younger brother Prince Thomas of Savoy disputed the power of their sisterinlaw and her French entourage When the first heir Francis Hyacinth died in 1638 both brothers started the Piedmontese Civil War with Spanish support The two parties were called principisti supporters of the Princes and madamisti supporters of Madama Reale Christine was notorious as much for her capricious rule as for her many lovers a trait from her father Henry IV who was famed for his many lovers also

After four years of fighting Christine was victorious thanks to French military support Not only did she keep the Duchy for her son she also prevented France getting too much power in the Duchy When peace was concluded in 1642 Maurice married his fourteenyearold niece Louise Christine abandoning the title of cardinal and asking dispensation from Pope Paul V Maurice became governor of Nice Christine of France stayed in firm control of the Duchy of Savoy until her son could follow in her footsteps her formal regency ended in 1648 but she remained in charge at his invitation until her death

She lived an uninhibited private life and had relationships with the French Ambassador Marini her brotherinlaw Maurizio and Count Filippo dAgli a handsome learned and courageous man who remained faithful to her all her life She encouraged her son Charles Emmanuel to marry her niece Franoise Madeleine dOrlans the youngest surviving daughter of Gaston Duke of Orlans her youngest brother They married 3 Apr 1663

Christine died at the Palazzo Madama Turin on 27 Dec 1663 at the age of 57 and was buried at the Basilica of SantAndrea She had outlived 4 of her seven children

Franoise Madeleine died in January 1664 and her son later married another cousin Marie Jeanne of Savoy Marie Jeanne would give birth to Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia who would later marry another French Princess and member of the House of Orlans Anne Marie dOrlans 17 years after her death in 1680 her granddaughter Victoria of Bavaria via her third daughter Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy would marry her older brothers grandson Louis de France known as the Fat and Monseigneur Christine thus became a direct ancestress of the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon via Victorias second son Philip V of Spain

Juthwara
Saint Juthwara was a British virgin and martyr from Dorset who probably lived in the 6th century
Her relics were translated to Sherborne during the reign of Ethelred the Unready Nothing further is known with certainty about her life

Her name is how she is known in AngloSaxon Some have suggested that it is a corruption of the British Aud Wyry meaning Aud the Virgin the name by which she is known in Brittany However since Aud Wyry simply means Aud the Virgin Aud is a Germanic name used in Northern France and not a Celtic name it is more likely that Aud Wyry is a Breton reinterpretation of her original name She was said to have been the sister of Paul Aurelian Sidwell of Exeter and Wulvela but this is hotly debated

The legend of Saint Juthwara is known from John Capgraves Nova Legenda Angliae after John of Tynemouth mid14th century According to this she was a pious girl who was the victim of a jealous stepmother She prayed and fasted often and frequently gave alms Upon the death of her father she began to suffer a pain in her chest Its source was ascribed to her sorrow and austerities As a remedy her stepmother recommended two soft cheeses be applied to her breasts telling her own son Bana that Juthwara was pregnant Bana felt her underclothes and found them moist whereupon he immediately struck off her head A spring of water appeared at the spot Juthwara then miraculously picked up her head and carried it back to the church Bana repented of his deed and became a monk founding a monastery of Gerber later known as Le Relecq on a battlefield

Juthwaras death took place at Halyngstoka generally accepted as Halstock in Dorset where she is known as Juthware and where local tradition points to a field still called by her name modernised to Judith BaringGould and Fisher suggested instead LanteglosbyCamelford in North Cornwall where the church is now named for Saint Julitta but may have originally borne Juthwaras name At Laneast ten miles to the east the church is dedicated to her sisters but this has apparently arisen by a modern confusion between Laneast and Gulval also known as Lanestly at Laneast the dedication in 1436 was to SS Sativola and Thomas the Martyr Wolvela does not appear until George Olivers Monasticon

In July 2012 Halstocks Parish church of St Mary had its dedication extended to include St Juthware in recognition of the local tradition

Juthwaras feast day is 18 November Her translation is generally held to be 13 July although one source gives 6 January Her body was translated to Sherborne Abbey in the early 11th century and her shrine remained a place of pilgrimage there until the Dissolution An illustration of her beheading appears in the Sherborne Missal

Juthwara is depicted in the Great East Window of Sherborne Abbey and on a number of altar screens in Devon in company with her sister Sidwell Her traditional emblem is a round soft cheese andor a sword She is depicted as a cephalophore in a late medieval statue in Guizeny in Brittany

Nierenstein reaction
The Nierenstein reaction is an organic reaction describing the conversion of an acid chloride into a haloketone with diazomethane It is an insertion reaction in that the methylene group from the diazomethane is inserted into the carbonchlorine bond of the acid chloride

The reaction proceeds through a diazonium salt intermediate formed by nucleophilic acyl substitution of the chloride with diazomethyl anion The chloride then displaces the diazo group in an SN2 reaction with N as the leaving group

If excess diazomethane is present during the reaction it can act as a base abstracting a hydrogen from the diazoniumsalt intermediate The result is a neutral diazoketone which does not react with the chloride Instead the byproduct diazoniummethyl from the other diazomethane molecule can be attacked by the chloride to produce chloromethane The unreactive diazoketone can be reactivated and reacted by treatment with hydrogen chloride to give the normal Nierenstein product

In some cases even limiting the amount of diazomethane gives a reaction process that stalls via the neutral diazoketone pathway requiring the addition of HCl gas to rescue it

Mandolin orchestra
A mandolin orchestra is an orchestra consisting primarily of instruments from the mandolin family of instruments such as the mandolin mandola mandocello and mandobass or mandolone Some mandolin orchestras use guitars and doublebasses instead of or as well as the lower mandolinfamily instruments

A mandolin orchestra is an ensemble of plucked string instruments similar in structure to the string sections of a symphony orchestra There are first and second mandolin sections analogous to first and second violins a mandola section analogous to the viola section mandocelli analogous to the violincelli classical guitars and a bass section originally of mandobasses but nowadays more likely to be acoustic bass guitar or double bass

The classical guitar section is very important and many orchestras are more accurately described as mandolin and guitar orchestras Many orchestras also include a percussion section

Most mandolin orchestras are communitybased and are supported by a core of professional musicians and teachers with a passion for plucked string instruments and music They are found in nearly all major cities in the western world as well as Japan Korea and South America

The stimulus to create mandolin groups often came from travelling mandolinists and teachers Immigration from Europe to other parts of the world resulted in the concept spreading rapidly with movements beginning quite early in the USA Japan and Australia Some indication of the speed of these developments across the globe can be appreciated by the following

On reviewing the SS Stewarts Banjo and Guitar Journal later called Banjo Guitar and Mandolin Journal between 1884 and 1900 one comes to a view at least in the USA and Australia that mandolin ensemble playing evolved within the banjo movement eventually replacing it as the better ensemble instrument

Mandolin orchestras were very popular in the early 20th Century and every city and town and many schools had one 

A considerable body of music was created much of which was simple or popular marches and foxtrots that were easy and fun to play However some serious music was also created and which requires every bit as much skill to play as anything in the more wellknown violin repertoire Principal among the important composers of such music were Raffaele Calace Arrigo Cappelletti Giuseppe Manente and Carlo Munier who all wrote beautiful and virtuosic music for various mandolin chamber music ensembles mandolin and guitar two mandolins and mandola etc as well as full orchestras

After World War I the mandolin orchestras went into a period of decline until interest in the mandolin was renewed as a part of the resurgent interest in folk music in the late 1950s and 1960s As this music began to be rediscovered orchestras began to form anew in large cities in the US

While there was a decline in interest the US orchestras continued to exist in Japan and Germany where they are known as Zupforchester and also in Italy

In the modern era many cities in the US host mandolin orchestras of many years experience many proudly boasting libraries of hundreds of compositions Significant new music continues to be written all over the world by composers such as Victor Kioulaphides John Craton Annette Kruisbrink Clarice Assad Francine Trester and Jeff Hijlkema

Hamid and Umer Hayat
Hamid Hayat born September 10 1983 is a United States citizen of Pakistani descent from Lodi California His father Umer Hayat born January 5 1958 was born in Pakistan and emigrated to the United States in 1976 he is a naturalized American citizen Together they were the subjects of the first terrorism trial in the state of California Both were alleged to be part of or associated with a terrorist sleeper cell

In 2019 a judge recommended their conviction be overturned citing an ineffective legal defense for Hayat  who was defended by a lawyer that had never previously served in a criminal case in a federal courtThe recommendation also cites a coerced confession obtained by the FBI which one former agent described as the sorriest confession he had ever seen

In June 2005 Hamid Hayat was arrested and charged with providing material support to terrorists and of lying about it to FBI agents The prosecution alleged that Hamid Hayat had spent the better part of two years at an alQaeda training camp in Pakistan returning in 2005 with an intent to attack civilian targets in the United States The defense contended that Hayat was in Pakistan to engage an arranged marriage On April 25 2006 a jury voted to convict Hamid Hayat of one count of providing material support or resources to terrorists and three counts of making false statements to the FBI in matters related to international or domestic terrorism The maximum penalty for these charges is 39 years of imprisonment Sentencing was set for July 14 2006 before US District Judge Garland E Burrell Jr

His father Umer Hayat was also arrested and charged with two counts of making false statements to the FBI regarding the investigation of his son and of certain members of the Muslim community of Lodi Umers charges ended in a hung jury When faced with a retrial for the same offenses he pled guilty in exchange for a release with time served

The younger Hayats conviction is controversial in some circles Supporters of the Hayats believe them to be innocents railroaded by overzealous FBI agents and post911 Islamophobia They cite the occasionally outlandish nature of the confessions especially Umers in particular where he describes a supposed alQaeda training camp populated by a thousand men doing pole vault practice in ninja masks Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle masks according to the Los Angeles Times

Hamid Hayats attorney Wazhma Mojaddidi also claims that he had been worn down by the FBIs fivehour interrogation and confessed to crimes he did not commit Hamid and Umer Hayats separate videotaped confessions were the linchpin of the governments case Former FBI agent James Wedick Jr a veteran of 35 years believed the confessions had been coaxed with intimidation and leading questions Wedick was never allowed to testify and present his analysis of the confession videotapes at Hamid Hayats original trial Prior to being contacted by defense attorneys for Hamid Hayat Wedick had had no knowledge of or involvement with the case

The government argued that there is a greater pattern at work A government informant taped him saying in regard to the murder of Daniel Pearl by Pakistani terrorists They killed him So Im pleased about that They cut him into pieces and sent him back That was a good job they did Now they cant send one Jewish person to Pakistan FBI agents also recovered from his room jihadist magazines eg of the JaisheMohammed and a jihad scrapbook containing articles praising the Taliban and Osama Bin Laden Hamid also carried in his wallet a supposed jihadi supplication reading O Allah we place you at their throats and we seek refuge in you from their evils

Much was made of how Umer Hayat seemed to possess sums of cash unusual for an icecreamtruck driver with only an 8th grade education eg a 390000 home with no outstanding debt According to US District Court Judge Garland Burrell Hayat appears to have access to a significant amount of cash from an unexplained source

There is also a tenuous family connection to radical Islam Umers fatherinlaw Hamids maternal grandfather is a prominent leader in the Jamiat UlemaeIslam a conservative strictly religious political party in Pakistan strongly associated with the Taliban in Afghanistan

Previously on April 19 2003 father and son had been stopped at Dulles International Airport on the way to Pakistan They were attempting to illegally carry 28093 in cash out of the country According to the defense this was money they had saved to build a vacation home in Pakistan and to pay for Hamids wedding and the wedding of his sister

After his initial conviction Hamid Hayat sought a new trial for which his attorneys Wazhma Mojaddidi and Dennis Riordan filed a motion on the grounds of misconduct by jury foreman Joseph Cote as well as other court misconduct Cote allegedly used racial slurs during the trial and compared Hayat to the Pakistani men who had conducted the recent terrorist attacks in London see 7 July 2005 London bombings and 21 July 2005 London bombings Cote also contacted an excused alternative juror during deliberations

The hearing was held on April 6 2007 On May 17 2007 US District Judge Garland E Burrell Jr rejected a new trial for Hamid Hayat writing in his ruling that the reports of juror misconduct were not credible Hamid Hayats defense attorney Wazhma Mojaddidi announced plans to appeal

On September 10 2007 Hamid Hayat was sentenced to 24 years in federal prison It was his 25th birthday In the words of Federal Judge Garland Burrell Jr Hayat had reentered the US ready and willing to wage violent jihad

The Hamid Hayat case is seen as an example of a precrime conviction McCulloch and Wilson 2016 The dissenting Judge Tashima in Hayats unsuccessful appeal argued he would reverse the conviction because the judicial branchs constitutional duty to do justice in criminal prosecutions was not fulfilled in this case in which the government asked a jury to deprive a man of his liberty largely based on dire but vague predictions that the defendant might commit unspecified crimes in the future United States v Hayat 2013 4 59 emphasis in original Judge Tashima acknowledged that the law permitted conviction on the basis that the defendant might commit such unspecified crimes in the future but argued that when the law allows for such convictions every aspect of the trial should be scrupulously fair and that Hayats trial did not meet this standard The majority likewise described the governments preventative approach as one that permits the conviction of potential terrorists who may never in fact have committed any terrorist act if not arrested and convicted United States v Hayat 2013 24

Global Harmonization Task Force
The Global Harmonization Task Force GHTF was a voluntary group of representatives from national medical device regulatory authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration FDA and the members of the medical device industry whose goal was the standardization of medical device regulation across the world The representatives from its five founding members the European Union the United States Canada Japan and Australia were divided into three geographical areas Europe AsiaPacific and North America each of which actively regulates medical devices using their own unique regulatory framework Founded in 1992 the GHTF was created in an effort to respond to the growing need for international harmonization in the regulation of medical devices

The GHTF disbanded late in 2012 Its mission has been taken over by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum IMDRF a successor organization composed of officials from regulatory agencies not industry  around the world The GHTF website is no longer operational

As quoted from the GHTF site now IMDRF The purpose of the GHTF is to encourage the convergence in regulatory practices related to ensuring the safety effectivenessperformance and quality of medical devices promoting technological innovation and facilitating international trade and the primary way in which this is accomplished is via the publication and dissemination of harmonized guidance documents on basic regulatory practices These documents which are developed by four different GHTF Study Groups can then be adoptedimplemented by member national regulatory authorities

The GHTF also serves as an information exchange forum through which countries with medical device regulatory systems under development can benefit from the experience of those with existing systems andor pattern their practices upon those of GHTF Founding Members

Stated succinctly the organization aims to standardize medical device regulations around the world by exchange of information

West Virginia coal wars
The West Virginia coal wars 191221 also known as the mine wars arose out of a dispute between coal companies and miners The first workers strike in West Virginia was the Cabin Creek and Paint Creek strike of 19121913 With help from Mary Mother Jones Harris Jones an important figure in unionizing the mine workers the miners demanded better pay better work conditions the right to trade where they pleased ending the practice of forcing miners to buy from companyowned stores and recognition of the United Mine Workers UMW The mining companies however refused to meet the demands of the workers and instead hired BaldwinFelts agents equipped with highpowered rifles to guard the mines and act as strikebreakers After the Agents arrived the miners either moved out or were evicted from the houses they had been renting from the coal companies moving into coal camps that were being supported by the Union Approximately 35000 people lived in these coal camps A month after the strike began hostilities began with the arrival of the BaldwinFelts Agents who provoked the miners Socialist Party activists began supplying miners with weapons 6 machine guns 1000 highpowered rifles and 50000 rounds of ammunition 

On September 1 1912 approximately 6000 unionized miners from across the Kanawha River crossed the river and declared their intent to kill the mine guards and destroy the company operations Due to this threat the mining companies deployed additional armed guards and awaited the miners attack Consequently the Governor proclaimed martial law to be in effect on September 2 1912 seizing 1872 highpowered rifles 556 pistols 6 machine guns 225000 rounds of ammunition and 480 blackjacks  as well as large quantities of daggers bayonets and brass knuckles

On May 19 1920 a shootout in Matewan West Virginia between agents of the BaldwinFelts and local miners who later joined the United Mine Workers of America sparked what became known as the Battle of Blair Mountain the largest insurrection in the United States since the American Civil War

West Virginia had only a few active coal mines during the US Civil War with fewer than 1600 miners in the whole state Coal mining would flourish however between 1880 and 1900 after competing railroad companies began carving routes through the mountains of Appalachia West Virginia produced 489000 tons of coal in 1869 4882000 tons of coal in 1889 and 89384000 tons of coal in 1917 The quick expansion of mining in West Virginia prompted many mining companies to construct company towns in which mining companies own many if not all housing amenities and public services Miners were often paid in coal scrip paper notes issued by mining companies that could only be redeemed at companyowned stores in company towns

Mining is a dangerous profession overall but between 1890 and 1912 West Virginia mines had the highest miner death rates in the country During World War I West Virginia miners faced higher death rates than even soldiers in the American Expeditionary Force fighting in Europe

Some West Virginian coal miners joined the United Mine Workers UMW in response to wage reductions following The Panic of 1893 By 1902 UMW membership in West Virginia had reached 5000 miners Union membership among West Virginia coal miners remained low however especially in southern parts of the state

UMW had a strong if isolated presence in the Paint Creek area and most miners there were unionized In March 1912 Paint Creek UMW miners attempted to renegotiate their contracts for higher pay and automatic union dues In response a number of Paint Creek mines withdrew their recognition of UWM

On April 18 1912 union and nonunion miners from Paint Creek as well as 7500 miners from the previously nonunion Cabin Creek Kanawha and Fayette counties went on strike The UMW set up tent camps for miners and their families who had often been evicted without warning UMW VicePresident Frank Hayes and the wellknown labor activist Mary Mother Jones even visited the state to pledge their support

Mining companies in the Paint Creek area hired strikebreakers and armed guards to suppress the strike including 300 agents from the BaldwinFelts Detective Agency Striking miners and their families were prohibited from using company bridges and roads as well as utilities like running water Company guards killed several miners over the first few months of the strike and constructed a machine gun equipped armored train known as the Bull Moose Special which they used to fire upon the tent camps of striking workers Miners with the support of Mother Jones and the Socialist Party of America acquired weapons and retaliated against the mining company guards

In September 1912 West Virginia Governor William E Glasscock declared martial law and sent 1200 state troops to confiscate weapons and ammunition attempted to quell the rising tensions between miners and mining companies While the declaration of martial law did reduce armed conflict in the winter of 19121913

In April 1913 UMW officials presented the Paint Creek mining companies with a compromise deal leaving out some miner demands but maintaining support for a 9hour workday accountability for miner compensation and protection from backlash for union membership After nearly a full year of work stoppages and fighting the mining companies accepted the UMW compromise which was enforced by West Virginia state soldiers

On April 22 and 23 1920 between 275 and 300 miners in Matewan Mingo County joined the United Mine Workers of America In retaliation the Burnwell Coal and Coke Company fired all unionaligned miners and gave them three days to leave their companyowned residences On April 27 1920 Mingo County officials arrested BaldwinFelts agent Albert C Felts who would later be involved in the Matewan shootout for illegally evicting miners of the Burnwell Coal and Coke Company as punishment for union activity Mingo County Sheriff G T Blankenship negotiated with miners groups that as long as only Mingo County officials enforced the eviction notices the miners would peacefully comply Miners in Mingo County continued to join the UMWA A May 6 1920 United Mine Workers meeting drew 3000 attendees By May 17 1920 the UMWA set up a tent colony for evicted miners outside of Matewan

On May 19 1920 thirteen agents of the BaldwinFelts Detective Agency returned to Matewan to evict miners from Stone Mountain Coal Corporation housing The BaldwinFelts agents were challenged by Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield and Matewan Mayor Cabel Testerman who contested the agents authority in the town The BaldwinFelts agents persisted however based on permission from a local justice of the peace BaldwinFelts agents carried out their evictions under watch of a crowd of miners and their families Hearing of the trouble stirring in Matawen miners from surrounding areas armed themselves and made their way to the town in case of a larger conflict

As the BaldwinFelts agents were headed to the train station to depart Matewan they were confronted once more by Police Chief Sid Hatfield Mayor Cabel Testerman Both Hatfield and BaldwinFelts agent Albert Felts reported that they had warrants for the others arrest

Accounts of the May 19th shootout itself differ Some reports indicate that BaldwinFelts agents attempted to arrest Sid Hatfield and shot Mayor Testermen when he intervened on Hatfields behalf Others indicate that Hatfield initiated the violence either by firing himself or by signalling a prepared ambush In either case the shootout resulted in 10 dead Mayor Testerman 2 miners and 7 BaldwinFelts agents including BaldwinFelts Agency Chief Thomas Felts younger brothers Albert and Lee

Support for unionization in Mingo County increased after the Matewan Shootout By July 1 1920 in the county had unionized and joined the UWM strike Miners and mine guards engaged in several armed skirmishes over the closure of coal mines and access to rail routes in the summer and fall of 1920 The West Virginia government declared martial law and sent federal troops to quell the strike but backed down under threat of a general strike of all union coal miners in West Virginia

BaldwinFelts Agency Chief Thomas Felts hired a team of lawyers to prosecute a case against Sid Hatfield and fifteen other men alleged to have participated in the Matewan Shootout specifically on the charge of murdering Albert Felts All sixteen men were however acquitted by a Mingo County jury Shortly thereafter the West Virginia State Legislature passed a bill allowing criminal cases to be prosecuted with juries summoned from another county Murder charges were renewed only this time for the deaths of the other 6 BaldwinFelts agents

Sid Hatfield and his deputy Ed Chambers were also brought up on charges of destroying the Mohawk mining camp in McDowell County On August 1 1921 Hatfield Chambers and their wives traveled unarmed to the McDowell County courthouse to stand trial Upon reaching the courthouse Hatfield and Chambers were shot and killed by waiting BaldwinFelts agents Miners in West Virginia were outraged at the deaths of Sid Hatfield and Ed Chambers In the weeks following the August 1st assassinations miners organized and armed themselves across West Virginia

From August 20 1921 miners began rallying at Lens Creek approximately ten miles south of West Virginia state capital of Charleston Estimates of total numbers vary but on August 24 between 5000 and 20000 miners began marching from Lens Creek into Logan County West Virginia Many of the miners were armed and some acquired weapons and ammo from the towns along the marchs path

Logan County Sheriff Don Chafin had assembled a fighting force of approximately 2000 county police state police state militia and BaldwinFelts agents to stop the approaching miners in the mountain range surrounding Logan County On August 25 the miners began arriving in the mountains surrounding Logan and fighting began between the two forces Though Sheriff Chafin commanded fewer men they were equipped with machine guns and rented aircraft from which they dropped rudimentary bombs on the attacking miners

On August 30 1921 President Warren G Harding declared martial law for the entire state of West Virginia and 2500 federal troops arrived on September 2 bringing with them machine guns and military aircraft armed with surplus explosive and gas bombs from the recently concluded World War I Facing a large and well equipped fighting force the miners were forced to stand down

Approximately around 550 miners and labor activists were convicted of murder insurrection and treason for their participation in the march from Lens Creek to Logan County and the ensuing Battle of Blair Mountain Though the battle ended in clear defeat for the prounion miners they gained some press support in the following years Press support did not extend to union growth however and UMW membership in West Virginia dropped by about half between 1921 and 1924

The Matewan shootout is reenacted annually in Matewan West Virginia

John Sayles dramatized the events of the Matewan shootout in his 1987 film Matewan

A documentary named The Mine Wars was made about these events for PBS and was originally aired on the network January 26 2016 Narrated by actor Michael Murphy it used archival material and interviews to convey the story as part of their ongoing American Experience series 

The West Virginia Mine Wars Museum located in downtown Matewan offers artifacts and interpretations of the events The building that houses the museum still bears the scars of bullet holes from the Matewan Massacre

Missionaries of St Francis de Sales
The Missionaries of St Francis de Sales MSFS also known as the Fransalians was founded in Annecy France on 24 October 1838 by Fr Peter Mermier under the patronage of St Francis de Sales The political disturbances in the country especially the French Revolution had its impact in the spiritual realm too as it left the people in a deep spiritual crisis and indifference towards their religious duties Sensing the signs of the time Fr Mermier took upon himself the task of a spiritual renewal in his people by preaching parish missions This special apostolate in turn gave rise to a community of preachers gathered around Fr Mermier

It was founded in response to the desire of St Francis de Sales to found a society of missionary priests Nearly two centuries after the saints death Monsignor Joseph Rey a successor of the Saint in the See of Annecy broached the subject of such a society to Father Peter Mermier who had been considering the same idea Accordingly Father Mermier put the design into execution

In 1830 the institute was formed with La Feuillette as the site for the motherhouse This was solemnly blessed by the bishop on 8 August 1837 and the congregation canonically instituted by him on 8 October 1838 The society was not to be a mere association of priests but a new religious congregation bound by simple vows Hence Father Mermier the first superiorgeneral offered himself and his companions to the Pope for foreign missions In 1845 his offer was accepted by Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the first missionaries of St Francis de Sales set out for India

The work has prospered and since that time more than 100 priests and seminarians have been sent out by the congregation besides many lay brothers More than 200 nuns of different orders have gone out at the call of the missionaries to help them The first batch of the Fransalians MSFS landed in Pondichery on 8 September 1845 and the first batch of the Fransalians reached Visakhapatnam on 19 February 1846 The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples entrusted the Vicariate of Visakhapatnam to the Fransalians on 2 May 1848 Until 1888 there was only one region of the Fransalians in India Visakhapatnam Region In 1888 Nagpur region was created by bifurcating the Visakhapatnam region Both were raised to the status of province in 1965 
The dioceses of Nagpur and Visakhapatnam have always been governed by prelates belonging to this institute In Visakhapatnam the first vicar apostolic was Mgr Neyret 1850 he was succeeded by Mgr Tissot first bishop of the diocese The first bishop of Nagpur was Mgr Riccaz after him came Mgr Pelvat a great supporter of the Indian way of religious life and Indian Theology developed by Brahmabandhab Upadyay 1861 1907 followed by Mgrs Crochet Bonaventure and Coppel

The Fransalians in France and Switzerland were directly under the Superior General until 1959 It became a region in 1960 and a province in 1965

The Fransalians went to England in 1861 England became a region of the Fransalians in 1940 and a province in 1965 In England the fathers have three missions in the Diocese of Clifton Since the persecution of 1903 the congregation has been obliged to leave Savoy for England where the juvenate the novitiate and the house of studies are successfully carried on

The mission in Brazil was begun in 1926 The Province of Brazil was established in 1965 In 1975 the Fransalians of the Visakhapatnam Province entered the NorthEast India for evangelization In 1984 the viceprovince of NE India was erected and later in 1990 it was raised to the status of a province

Following the original vision of the Founder the Servant of God Fr Mermier the Fransalians entered the African Continent in 1988 The mission began in Tanzania and the Province of EastAfrica comprising Tanzania Kenya and Uganda in 1996

An autonomous American Mission in the US was founded in 1990 and later raised to the Status of a Region under the Superior General on 3 July 2007

The SouthWest India Province was established in 1991 bifurcating the Visakhapatnam Province The Visakhapatnam Province was further bifurcated to form the Tamil Nadu  Pondichery region under the Visakhapatnam Province on 24 January 2005 Three years later this region was raised to the status of a Province with a new name Chennai Province on 24 January 2008 and in the same year on 15 August 2008 it was renamed as SouthEast Province The Nagpur Province which was established in 1965 was later renamed MahrarashtraGoa Province It was bifurcated in 1996 and the present Nagpur and Pune provinces were erected

The superiorsgeneral since the foundation have been the Very Reverend Fathers Mermier Gaiddon Clavel Tissot Gojon and Bouvard

Swedish ballad tradition
The Swedish ballad tradition is the tradition of Swedish poetic singersongwriters This visa tradition should not be confused with traditional medieval Swedish ballads medeltida ballader which are representative of a typical tradition of Scandinavian ballads

The Swedish ballad tradition today is both a respected art form and an important basis of the popular Swedish and Scandinavian singalong tradition The song type is typically known as visa in Swedish and troubadours in the genre are called vissngare In context the Swedish word ballad is a subtype of visa that tells a story in many verses similar to the medieval ballads as opposed to for instance lyrical songs about the beauty of nature The Swedish ballads can be performed to a big orchestra but are often sung to fairly simple accompaniment on guitar or other instruments such as piano or accordion

The genre started with Carl Michael Bellman in the late 18th century In the 19th century poetic songwriting fell into decline in favour of academic student choirs until it was revived in the 1890s by Sven Scholander Poets increasingly continued the tradition of having their poetry put to music to give it a wider audience In the early 1900s a lot of poetry of the 90s poets Gustaf Frding and Erik Axel Karlfeldt had been put to music and the popularity of those poets largely depended on the troubadours

Birger Sjberg 18851929 was one of the early popular troubadours Sjberg published the poetry collection Fridas Book Fridas bok 1922 a light and humorous story of the young Frida In 1926 he reinvented himself with Kriser och kransar Crises and garlands a much darker collection of poetry It is regarded as the foremost collection of Swedish poetry of the 1920s
One of the most renowned Swedish troubadours of the 20th century was Evert Taube 18901976 He established himself as a performing artist in 1920 and toured Sweden for about three decades He is best known for songs about sailors ballads about Argentina and songs about the Swedish countryside

A poet who is known for songs is Nils Ferlin 18981961 who published six collection of poetry between 1930 and 1957 Ferlin melancholic but with a stinging irony and very rhythmical which made them easy for friends and colleagues to put music to The titles of some of the poems already from the start referred to them being sung as songs such as En valsmelodi which translates as A waltz tune and the title of his first collection of poems En dddansares visor

Other wellknown singersongwriters in the Swedish ballad tradition after Evert Taube were Olle Adolphson 19342004 and Cornelis Vreeswijk 19371987 Vreeswijks songs were initially leftist protest songs where he took upon himself to speak for the weaker men of society After his death Vreeswijk also gained appreciation for his poetic qualities

Perhaps the bestknown contemporary troubadour is Lars Winnerbck whose folkrock ballads often infused with a poetic quality mix a Christian socialist political message with a typically Swedish sensitivity to nature in the spirit of Vreeswijk making him one of Swedens most popular currently active musicians

The Swedish ballad tradition has close similarities to the ballad tradition also known as vise in Norway with Alf Prysen as an early and prominent yet distinct representative The Swedish ballad tradition has also greatly inspired the modern ballad tradition in Norway that started in the 1960s as a cultural movement known as viseblgen the ballad wave Some of its prominent representatives are Ole Paus Lillebjrn Nilsen and Finn Kalvik

Moses Yale Beach
Moses Yale Beach January 7 1800  July 18 1868 was an American inventor and publisher who started the Associated Press and is credited with originating print syndication

He was born in Wallingford Connecticut His father was a plain farmer and gave him an ordinary education He early showed a mechanical aptitude and at 14 was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker Before his term was up he purchased his freedom and established a cabinet making business in Northampton Massachusetts The business failed and he moved to Springfield There he endeavored to manufacture a gunpowder engine for propelling balloons but this enterprise was also a failure He next attempted to open steam navigation on Connecticut river between Hartford and Springfield and would have succeeded if financial difficulties had not obliged him to cease operations before his steamer was completed

He then invented a ragcutting machine for paper mills The invention was widely used but Beach derived no pecuniary benefit due to his tardiness in applying for a patent He then settled in Ulster County New York where he invested in an extensive paper mill At first he was successful and after six years was wealthy but after seven years an imprudent investment dispersed his fortune and he was compelled to abandon his enterprise

In the meantime though he had married the sister of the founder and proprietor of the New York Sun Benjamin Day In 1835 he acquired an interest in the paper then small both in the size of its sheet and circulation And with a 40000 payment he soon became sole proprietor

According to historian Elmo Scott Watson Beach invented print syndication in 1841 when he produced a twopage supplement and sold it to a score of newspapers in the US northeast

The Associated Press was organized in May 1846 by Beach at that time publisher of The Sun joined by the New York Herald the New York Courier and Enquirer The Journal of Commerce and the New York Evening Express The AP was formed by the five New York daily papers to share the cost of transmitting news of the MexicanAmerican War

During the War US President James K Polk sent Beach to Mexico to arrange a treaty of peace but the negotiations were broken off by a false report announcing the defeat of General Zachary Taylor by Mexican General Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna

Beach retired in 1857 with an ample fortune and left the paper to his sons He then returned to Wallingford

Beach was married twice and left five sons Moses Sperry Henry Alfred Ely Joseph and William and one granddaughter Emmeline who married the naturalist and artist Abbott Handerson Thayer She was the daughter of Moses Sperry Beach She and her father are described in Mark Twains The Innocents Abroad

Common waxbill
The common waxbill Estrilda astrild also known as the St Helena waxbill is a small passerine bird belonging to the estrildid finch family It is native to subSaharan Africa but has been introduced to many other regions of the world and now has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10000000km It is popular and easy to keep in captivity

It is a small bird 4 to 5 inches in length with a wingspan of 4 12 inches and a weight of 35 to 34 ounce It has a slender body with short rounded wings and a long graduated tail The bright red bill of the adult is the colour of sealing wax giving the bird its name The plumage is mostly greybrown finely barred with dark brown There is a red stripe through the eye and the cheeks and throat are whitish There is often a pinkish flush to the underparts and a reddish stripe along the centre of the belly depending on the subspecies The rump is brown and the tail and vent are dark Females are similar to the males but are paler with less red on the belly Juveniles are duller with little or no red on the belly fainter dark barring and a black bill

Similar species include the blackrumped crimsonrumped and blacklored waxbills The blackrumped waxbill is black rather than brown on the rump and has a pale vent area underneath the tail The crimsonrumped waxbill has a dark bill red rump and some red on the wings and tail The blacklored waxbill found only in the Democratic Republic of Congo has a black rather than red stripe through the eye

The common waxbill has a variety of twittering and buzzing calls and a distinctive highpitched flightcall The simple song is harsh and nasal and descends on the last note

There are about 17 subspecies distributed widely across much of Africa south of the Sahara They are present in most parts of East Central and Southern Africa except for regions of desert or dense forest In West Africa they are more local with the main population centred on Sierra Leone Liberia and the Ivory Coast Common waxbills inhabit open country with long grass and rank vegetation They are often found near water in marshes and among reeds They can be tame and will enter gardens parks and farmland

Birds have often escaped from captivity or been deliberately released Breeding populations have become established in many places where the climate is sufficiently warm and where there is a sufficient supply of grass seeds They are now found on many islands around Africa Saint Helena Ascension Island the Cape Verde Islands So Tom and Prncipe Mauritius Runion Rodrigues the Seychelles and Ile Amsterdam They may possibly be native on some of these islands In Europe the common waxbill has become widespread in Portugal and is spreading through Spain There are small populations on Madeira and Gran Canaria and it has recently appeared on Tenerife and the Azores In the Americas waxbills are found in Trinidad several parts of Brazil and there are a few on Bermuda In the Pacific there are populations on New Caledonia Efate Island in Vanuatu Tahiti and the Hawaiian Islands In Spain it has been introduced in the largest cities in the last ten years and is now quite commonly seen in Madrid Barcelona and Valencia as well as along the SpanishPortuguese border

The nest is a large ball of crisscrossed grass stems with a long downwardpointing entrance tube on one side It is built in a cavity usually low down amongst dense vegetation A rudimentary second nest cocks nest may be built on top where the male sleeps Four to seven white eggs are laid They are incubated for 11 to 13 days and the young birds fledge 17 to 21 days after hatching Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks The timing of the breeding season varies in different parts of the world Nests may be parasitized by the pintailed whydah which lays its eggs in the nests of estrildid finches In captivity they will breed in an aviary and can raise four broods in a year

The diet consists mainly of grass seeds but insects are also eaten on occasions especially during the breeding season when more protein is needed The waxbills typically forage in flocks which may contain hundreds or even thousands of birds They usually feed by clinging to the stems with their long spindly claws and picking from the flower heads but they will also search for fallen seeds on the ground They need to drink regularly as the seeds contain little water

General Command of Mapping Turkey
The General Command of Mapping  or HGK is the national mapping agency of Turkey under the Ministry of National Defense and is responsible for the official topographical mapping of the country in both hardcopy and digital forms

The HGK produces and provides geographic information for defense and development purposes in addition to planning standardizing and producing and maintaining geographic materials The HGK consists of a team of experts and two B200 Beechcraft planes stationed at the Gvercinlik Army Air Base in Ankara They have the capacity for global aerial coverage are open to any proposals from international bodies in need of their services

Turkish mapping dates to the 15th century Some of the first examples of Turkish mapping include charts drawn by Ibrahim Mursel and a world chart painted in nine colors on a deer skin by the famous navy commander of the Ottoman Empire Admiral Piri Reis A great number of maps can be found dating up to the 19th century which exemplify the historical aspect of Turkish mapping

The establishment of the Mapping Commission in 1895 as a unit subordinate to the Fifth Department of the Turkish General Staff is accepted as the beginning of modern cartography in Turkey The Mapping Commission is considered the precursor to the current office the General Command of Mapping The Mapping Commission performed its preliminary works in five or six rooms reserved for them on the upper floor of the old Gendarmerie Office

Since the rapid production of the maps needed urgently for national defense required a larger and more capable organization the Mapping Commission was arranged on October 28 1918 The Commission was established as an independent mapping department of the Ministry of National Defense which by that time had several branches triangulation topography reconnaissance cartography central offices a surveying battalion and a surveying school

The Mapping Department moved to Ankara from Istanbul after the Turkish War of Independence It was settled in the Attar Basi Khan in Koyunpazari which at the time was almost in the center of the city The printing section also started its work in the same building which today is the School of Arts in Ulus In 1924 the Department which is still inside the General Directorate Garrison moved to buildings located between the Military Sewing Plant and the General Directorate

Following this relocation maps and plans required by governmental bodies universities and private companies were produced in line with the changes laid down after the foundation of the new state the Turkish Republic After these developments a need arose for reorganization of the department Lieut Gen M Sevki ler now regarded as the founder of the General Command of Mapping prepared a bill for the new organization the General Directorate of Mapping He sent it to the Ministry of National Defense in early 1925

According to the legal procedure following the approval of Ministry of National Defense the bill was passed to the Prime Ministry to be discussed in the Ministerial Council and presented to the Turkish Grand National Assembly the body with authority to pass the bill

As a result the Law No 657 was enacted by the parliament on May 2 1925 This law authorized the reorganization of the Mapping Department under a new name the General Directorate of Mapping reporting to the Ministry of National Defense The law made the National Mapping Agency responsible for the production of all kinds of maps and plans to meet the requirements of Turkish Armed Forces and all governmental bodies specifically ministries universities private companies and individuals

As a result of these changes the General Directorate of Mapping had the following departments

Law No 657 was amended with Law No 203 on January 2 1961 Due to the policies created by the InterMinisterial Commission for Coordinating and Planning of Mapping Affairs and to the instructions set forth in the bylaw for supply and usage of maps and mapping information the General Directorate of Mapping was renamed in 1983 to the General Command of Mapping This change also entitled the HGK to produce maps at scales smaller than 15000 The production of maps at a scale of 125000 which is the base scale is carried out according to the specifications of NATO standards STANAG which ensure interoperability among NATO nations

Sony Ericsson W810
The W810 also available as the W810i and W810c is a camera phone produced by Sony Ericsson It was released in January 2006 It is the successor of the W800

The W810 is part of Sony Ericssons Walkman line of mobile phones While being similar to the W800 the W810 benefited from several improvements Most notably are quad band connectivity EDGE support for faster wireless data transfers a light level sensor a slightly enhanced display but slightly reduced battery life

Other features include a full function internet browser twomegapixel digital camera with autofocus and flash the HPM70 stereo headset Memory Stick PRO Duo slot 20MB of internal memory and a musiconly mode where phone functions are fully turned off which also allows the phone to be used as a Walkman in areas mobile phones would usually be barred from such as airplanes and hospitals in addition to providing longer batterylife The phone supported MP3 AMR MIDI IMY EMY WAV 16 kHZ maximum sample rate and AAC audio formats and MPEG4 and 3GPP video formats However WMA audio format is not supported

While official support for Memory Stick PRO Duo is capped at 4 GB users have reported using 16 GB sticks with full functionality read and write though at larger sizes some functions boot time media playback and file retrieval for example are noticeably slower

There were many small cosmetic changes from the W800 but most noticeable is the absence of the classic joystick that has been found on the majority of Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the T68i This has been replaced by a Dpad designed to improve ease of use when listening to music and to provide a longer life to the keypad as the classic joystick tended to fail due to dust The casing color has changed from burnt orange and cream to Satin Black or Fusion White The sliding camera lens cover has also been omitted completely However a K750i or W800 back cover with lens cover will fit with minor modifications

The Sony Ericsson W810 is available as the W810i for Europe the Middle East Africa AsiaPacific and North America and the W810c for mainland China The W810 was released worldwide in January 2006 A white color variation officially called Fusion White was released on 20 June 2006

Simeon ben Zemah Duran
Simeon ben Zemah Duran also Tzemach Duran 13611444  known as Rashbatz  or Tashbatz was a Rabbinical authority student of philosophy astronomy mathematics and especially of medicine which he practised for a number of years at Palma de Majorca A major 15th century posek his published decisions in matters of halacha have been widely quoted in halachic literature for hundreds of years

Simeon ben Tzemach was born in the Hebrew month of Adar 1361 Various accounts put his birthplace as either Barcelona or the island of Majorca He was a near relation but not a grandson of Levi ben Gershon He was a student of Ephraim Vidal and of Jonah de Maestre rabbi in Zaragoza or in Calatayud whose daughter Bongoda he married 

After the persecution of 1391 in the Balearic Isles and Majorca he fled Spain with his father and sister for Algiers where in addition to practicing medicine he continued his studies during the earlier part of his stay In 1394 he and the Algerian rabbi Isaac ben Sheshet known as Rivash drafted statutes for the Jewish community of Algiers After Rivashs retirement Duran became rabbi of Algiers in 1407 Unlike his predecessor he refused on principle to accept any confirmation of his appointment by the regent As Duran had lost all his property during the massacre at Palma he was forced against his will to accept a salary from the community not having other means of subsistence He held this office until his death His epitaph written by himself has been reprinted for the first time from a manuscript in Orient Lit v 452 According to Joseph Sambari Simon was much respected in court circles Medieval Jew Chron i 130 He was the father of the Rashbash

Durans Magen Avot was a polemic against Christians and Muslims of which the fourth chapter of the second part was published separately as Keshet uMagen The Arrow and the Shield

Simon was prolific He wrote commentaries on several tractates of the Mishnah and the Talmud and on Alfasi Nos 4 5 7 11 12 and 16 in the list of his works given below he treated various religious dogmas as well as the synagogal rite of Algiers Nos 5 8 10 16 while in his responsa he showed a profound acquaintance with the entire halakic literature His theologicophilosophical scholarship as well as his secular learning is conspicuous in his elaborate work Magen Abot in which he also appears as a clever controversialist No 7 The same ability is evidenced in his writings against Hasdai Crescas which afford him an opportunity to defend Maimonides No 2 in his commentary on the Pentateuch No 6 where he takes occasion to enter into polemics with Levi ben Gershon and in that on the Book of Job No 1 especially the introduction In his commentary on the Pirke Avot he shows a broad historical sense No 7 part iv and it is not improbable that the tradition which ascribes to him the historicodidactic poem Seder haMishneh lehaRambam No 9 is well founded

Simon also wrote a considerable number of poems both religious and secular Nos 9  15 commented on the Pesah Haggadah the Hoshanot the works of more ancient poets Nos 5 c 13 14 and he was the author of numerous pamphlets The following list of Durans writings is arranged according to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet on the basis of a catalogue drawn up by the author himself Responsa vol iii

<doc id="7700255" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700255" title="Dutch Colonial Revival architecture">
Dutch Colonial Revival architecture
Dutch Colonial is a style of domestic architecture primarily characterized by gambrel roofs having curved eaves along the length of the house Modern versions built in the early 20th century are more accurately referred to as Dutch Colonial Revival a subtype of the Colonial Revival style

The modern use of the term is to indicate a broad gambrel roof with flaring eaves that extend over the long sides resembling a barn in construction The early houses built by settlers were often a single room with additions added to either end or short side and very often a porch along both long sides Typically walls were made of stone and a chimney was located on one or both ends Common were doublehung sash windows with outward swinging wood shutters and a central double Dutch door

Settlers of the Dutch colonies in New York Delaware New Jersey and western Connecticut built these homes in ways familiar to the regions of Europe from which they came like the Low Countries the Palatine parts of Germany and Huguenot regions of France Used for its modern meaning of gambrelroofed house the term does not reflect the fact that housing styles in Dutchfounded communities in New York evolved over time In the Hudson Valley for example the use of brick or brick and stone is perhaps more characteristic of Dutch Colonial houses than is their use of a gambrel roof In Albany and Ulster Counties frame houses were almost unknown before 1776 while in Dutchess and Westchester Counties the presence of a greater proportion of settlers with English roots popularised more construction of woodframe houses After a period of log cabin and bankdugout construction the use of the inverted V roof shape was common The gambrel roof was used later predominantly between 1725 and 1775 although examples can be found from as early as 1705 The general rule before 1776 was to build houses that were only oneandahalf stories high except in Albany where there were a greater proportion of twostory houses Fine examples of these houses can be found today like those in the Huguenot Street Historic District of New Paltz New York

In the American colonies both the Dutch and Germans plus others along the Rhine region of Europe contributed to the Dutch fashion Three easily accessible examples of Dutch Netherlands or German architecture can be seen 15 story 1676 Jan Martense Schenck House in the Brooklyn Museum 15 story 1730s Schenck House located in the Old Beth Page Historic Village and the twostory 1808 Gideon Tucker House at No 2 White St at Broadway in Manhattan All three represent distinctly Dutch NetherlandsGerman styles using Hframe for construction wood clapboard large rooms double hung windows off set front entry doors sharply sloped roofs and large open fireplaces Often there is a Hipped roof or curved eves but not always Barns in the DutchGerman fashion share the same attributes

Examples of hipped and not hipped roofs can be seen on the three examples provided above The 1676 and 1730 Schenck houses are examples of Dutch houses with Hframe construction but without the hipped roof The 1730 Schenck house has the distinctive curved eves Hips can be in a few different styles The more common being a Mansard as known in Europe or gambrel as known in American English both having two sloped on at least two sides The Gideon Tucker though an older Englishman choose to build his house with a gambrel roof and in an urban DutchGerman fashion

Beginning in the late 19th century America began to look back romantically upon its colonial roots and the country started reflecting this nostalgia in its architecture Within this Colonial Revival one of the more popular designs was a redux of features of the original Dutch Colonial The term Dutch Colonial appeared sometime between 1920 and 1925

Within the context of architectural history the more modern style is specifically defined as Dutch Colonial Revival to distinguish it from the original Dutch Colonial However this style was popularly known simply as Dutch Colonial and this continues to be the case today In New York for instance the actual 17thcentury colonial architecture of New Amsterdam has completely vanished lost in the fires of 1776 and 1835 leaving only archaeological remnants

Up and through the 1930s Dutch Colonials were most popular in the Northeast While the original design was always reflected some details were updated such as the primary entryway moving from the end to the long side of the house The more modern versions also varied a great deal with regard to materials used architectural details and size For example one Dutch Colonial might be a small twostory structure of with dormers bearing shedlike overhangs while another larger example would have three stories and a grand entrance adorned with a transom and sidelights

Examples of urban style of Dutch Colonial Revival architecture can be found in Manhattan New York 57 Stone Street was rebuilt in 1903 by C P H Gilbert on behest of the owner Amos F Eno The buildings to the back on South William Street 1323 also were reconstructed in the Dutch revival style evoking New Amsterdam with the use of red brick as building material and the features of stepped gables Stepped gables on early 20thcentury Dutch Revival buildings on S William Street in Lower Manhattan recall the Dutch origins of the city The area was declared a historic district in 1996 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission

The Childrens Aid Society had a number of its centers constructed in the Dutch colonial revival style such as the Rhinelander Childrens Center at 350 East 88th Street the 6th Street Industrial School on 630 East 6th Street the Fourteenth Ward Industrial School at 256258 Mott Street and the Elizabeth Home for Girls at 307 East 12th Street

West End Avenue saw a large number of buildings designed in the Dutch colonial revival style The West End Collegiate Church was modelled after the Vleeshal at the Grote Markt in Haarlem

Further examples in New York City are the former George S Bowdoin Stable at 149 East 38th Street 119 West 81st Street and 18 West 37th Street

An industrial example was the Wallabout Market designed by the architect William Tubby and constructed in 18941896 They were demolished in 1941 during World War II

Sunnyside in Tarrytown New York was partly constructed in Dutch Colonial revival

112 Ocean Avenue a Dutch Colonial home became infamous as the site of the Amityville Horror

Goodenough College
Goodenough College is a postgraduate residence and educational trust on Mecklenburgh Square in Bloomsbury central London England Other names under which the college has been known are London House William Goodenough House and the London Goodenough Trust

Goodenough College is an educational charity that provides residential accommodation for talented British and international postgraduates and their families studying in London The College provides a vibrant community for all those who live here through a unique programme of intellectual cultural and social activities that aims to provide Members with an international network and a truly global outlook

The current director of the college is Rebecca Matthews MA Cantab Former Managing Director of the European Capital of Culture Aarhus 2017 

Goodenough has residential and study facilities and an extensive extracurricular programme which includes a conference series aimed at examining subjects of international concern As of 2018 the College is home to approximately 700 International postgraduate students and their families representing approximately 80 different nations 

The college is located in London and set on Mecklenburgh Square around a private garden to which only residents have access

The college was incorporated in 1930 by a group of prominent Londoners including the chairman of Barclays Bank and founder of Barclays Bank DCO Dominion Colonial and Overseas Frederick Craufurd Goodenough Goodenough and his friends wanted to provide able young men coming to London from the dominions and colonies future leaders of what was then a large empire with a collegiate life along Oxbridge lines in London The college was a moot hall and at the same time a place where they would form lasting friendships in tolerance and understanding

The search for a site for the new college was centred on Bloomsbury to which the University of London was preparing a move from South Kensington An ideal island site for sale freehold was found between Guilford Street and Mecklenburgh Square and the College bought it in 1930

Plans were to design and build a new college but this would take time which the governors did not want to waste In the traditional manner of Bloomsburys philanthropic institutions they made a start in a small way in some of the roomy old houses on the site London House first opened its doors in October 1931 in Nos 47 Caroline Place now Mecklenburgh Place on the west side of the site The house was soon full with a long waiting list and by the start of World War II occupied all the Caroline Place houses

A new London House for 300 single students was built between 1935 and 1963 to the designs of the architect Sir Herbert Baker his partner Alexander T Scott and their successor Vernon Helbing It was completed in three stages

Stage 1 193537 The southeast corner including the Great Hall Charles Parsons Library commonrooms and the Guilford Street entrance This was the only part to be completed in Sir Herbert Bakers lifetime

Stage 2 194853 The rest of the south wing the west wing and the northwest corner Alexander Scott continued in Bakers style with some simplification of detail

Stage 3 196163 The north wing including the northeast corner It was built to a lower cost than the other stages for example no flintwork At the same time architect Vernon Helbing created the college chapel out of former offices

In the 1940s at the instigation of the Chairman of the College Governors Sir William Goodenough the Lord Mayor of London launched a Thanksgiving Fund to raise money in the UK and do something to thank the people of the Commonwealth and the United States for their generous gifts especially of food parcels during and after World War II The money raised was used to build William Goodenough House for women and married students from those countries replacing houses destroyed or badly damaged in the war on the north east of the Square At the same time the bombed houses in adjacent Heathcote Street were rebuilt as an annexe and the House was completed in 1957 Later wings Julian Crossley Court 1974 and Ashley Ponsonby Court 1991 brought the capacity of the House up to 120 rooms for single students and 60 flats for married couples and families

The two parallel institutions developed their own characters over time  the quiet surroundings of the WGH common rooms appealed to some LH residents and various Willie G girls preferred the noisier atmosphere of the London House bar Traditions developed such as the LH rugby team singing lullabies to the inhabitants of WGH after the annual sports dinner and many LHWGH romances flourished and in some cases resulted in marriage and even children The two houses London House and William Goodenough House eventually became mixed in 1991

Nos 2225 Mecklenburgh Square survived the war and were used as a nurses home until 1989 when they were handed back in a very dilapidated state At first the houses were repaired and used as inexpensive accommodation for shortstay visitors mostly returning alumni and other academics in London to attend conferences and seminars By 1997 however it was apparent that the building required modernization if they were to meet the standards that would be required in the 21st century

The houses were closed and plans made to add No 21 and renovate and upgrade at a cost of 35 million There were delays because the Georgian houses are listed buildings in a conservation area and the work required the approval of both English Heritage and the London Borough of Camden planning department Eventually the plans were passed and the Goodenough Club opened its doors in April 2001 The hotel is open to academic and professional visitors as well as conference delegates from around the world and was renamed as The Goodenough on Mecklenburgh Square in 2018

As the name of the college and of the Directors equivalent position has changed over time the title of each appointee is given

Up until the 1970s London House was a singlesex menonly building The position of London House warden was abolished in 2008

From the instigation of William Goodenough House in 1950 it was run by a separate warden Up until the 1970s William Goodenough House was a singlesex womenonly building while London House was a menonly building The position of William Goodenough House warden was abolished in 2007

Dendi Kingdom
The Dendi Kingdom 15911901 was a West African state in modernday Niger founded by the Dendi people after the collapse of the Songhai Empire It was conquered by France in 1901

Under the Songhai empire Dendi had been the easternmost province governed by the prestigious Dendifari governor of the eastern front Askia Ishaq II fled to here after he was defeated by the invading Saadi dynasty of Morocco at the Battle of Tondibi and at another battle seven months later In Dendi he was deposed by his brother Muhammad Gao who was in turn murdered on the order of the Moroccan pasha The Moroccans then appointed Sulayman as puppet king ruling the Niger between Djenn and Gao South of Tillaberi the Songhai resistance against Morocco continued under Askia Nuh a son of Askia Dawud He established his capital at the yet unlocalized town of Lulami

After the Moroccans had Askia Sulayman appointed as their puppet the pasha Mahmud ibn Zarqun attempted to conquer Dendi Askia Nuh resisted the invasion by a costly guerilla warfare lasting two years In 1594 Mahmud was forced to discontinue the war and retreated just to be killed in the same year by Dogon with whom Nuh was probably allied The new pasha called Mansur continued the war against Dendi and again Nuh resorted to guerilla warfare This situation lasted until 1599 when Nuhs followers became tired of the war and deposed him in favor of his brother Harun
In 1609 the Malian city of Djenn revolted against the Saadi pashas governors with Dendi support The Saadi were eventually able to regain the city but with a lack of support from their homeland they soon abandoned the area leaving it to Tuareg and Fulbe nomads

In 1612 Askiya alAmin came to power in Dendi His short reign of six years was followed by the rule of Askiya Dawud Dawud killed many people during his reign including relatives and members of the military His brother Ismail fled to Timbuktu and sought Saadi support to overthrow alAmin Ismail returned in to Dendi and deposed his brother in 1639 Upon attempting to send the foreign army back he was deposed and replaced by a ruler that the pashas felt would be easier to deal with This ruler was eventually removed by the Songhai people

Dendi existed for the next two and a half centuries witnessing increasingly unstable reigns coups and countercoups When France entered the region Dendi was defensively unprepared In 1901 the French deposed the last askiya of the Dendi ending Songhais control of either Mali or Niger until independence

To efficiently and impartially develop implement and administer in a prudent manner programs that provide income protection to members and their beneficiaries on behalf of participating employers

IMRF is established under statutes adopted by the Illinois General Assembly It is governed by a fully elected board of eight trustees Four trustees are elected by employers three are elected by participating members and one annuitant trustee is elected by IMRF retirees The Board appoints an Executive Director who is responsible for all administrative functions and supervision of staff employees

IMRF is a defined benefit retirement plan that provides retirement survivor disability and death benefits to municipal government employees in Illinois It is governed by Article 7 of the Illinois Pension Code

The 61st General Assembly of the State of Illinois created IMRF effective July 29 1939 The first meeting of the IMRF board was held on September 8 1939 in the office of the Municipal Public Utility annuity and benefit fund at 135 S LaSalle St in Chicago

IMRF began operation on January 1 1941 with five original employers City of Evanston City of Galesburg Village of Riverside Rockford Park District and City of Rockford The first benefit awards were approved at the March 1941 board meeting At that same meeting the board approved IMRFs first investment a 5000 Treasury bond at 2 percent due on March 15 of 1952 or 1954 with the assumption that 1952 was an option year

In 1947 the Illinois legislature required the IMRF staff to participate as members of the system Later in that same year the Illinois legislature mandated participation by all Illinois school districts except those located in the city of Chicago and all their employees except those covered by the Teachers Retirement System of the State of Illinois Coverage of schools increased the number of employers in IMRF from 156 to 652 and the number of members from 11171 to 17119

Effective January 1 1951 all cities villages and incorporated towns with populations of 10000 or more and all counties except Cook County and sanitary districts except Metropolitan Chicago Sanitary District were mandated by legislation into IMRF

In 1955 an Illinois Supreme Court decision ruled that IMRF statutes provided an option for municipalities to enter but none to exit

In 1955 IMRF was included in the Retirement Systems Reciprocal Act a provision of the statutes which allows total service with any of several public pension systems in Illinois to be considered when determining an annuity

1870 The land that now includes General Alvarado Partido came into the ownership of Fortunato de La Plaza

1879 The area changes jurisdiction from Balcarce to General Pueyrredn

1887 It was around this time the project to build Miramar was undertaken by Jose Mara Dupuy Rmulo Otamendi engineer and Fortunato de la Plaza

1888 Miramar was founded on 20 September

1889 Construction began on the first church in Miramar

Franz Xaver Gerl
Franz Xaver Gerl    was a bass singer and composer of the classical era He sang the role of Sarastro in the premiere of Mozarts opera The Magic Flute

Gerl was born on in Andorf then Bavaria since 1780 part of Austria He sang as a chorister as a child in Salzburg the New Grove asserts that he was probably the pupil of Leopold Mozart He attended the University of Salzburg studying logic and physics His career as a bass began in 1785 with the theatrical company of Ludwig Schmidt

He evidently had an impressively low vocal range Branscombe 1991 observes that the very low notes that Mozart included in the part of Sarastro have been the despair of many a bass singer since

By 1787 he had joined the theatrical company of Emanuel Schikaneder for which he sang the demanding role of Osmin in Mozarts opera The Abduction from the Seraglio and other roles In 1789 the troupe settled at the Theater auf der Wieden in Vienna Gerl participated in a system of joint composition used by Schikaneders troupe in which Singspiele were produced rapidly by having several composers collaborate As such Gerl may have been the composer of the aria Ein Weib ist das herrlichste Ding for which Mozart wrote a set of variations for piano K 613 the composer may instead have been another singercomposer in the troupe Benedikt Schack

Mozart gradually came to participate more in the activities of the Schikaneder troupe culminating in his opera The Magic Flute 1791 with libretto by Schikaneder Gerl premiered the role of Sarastro and continued to sing this part in many performances through 1792 He left Schikaneders troupe in 1793

Gerl may have been a participant in a rehearsal of Mozarts Requiem on the day before the composer died for details see Benedikt Schack

Gerls later career took him to Brno and Mannheim where he retired in 1826 He died there on 

Peter Branscombe writing in the New Grove offers the following concerning Gerls reputation as a singer When Schrder the greatest actormanager of his age went to Vienna in 1791 he was told not to miss hearing Benedikt Schack and Gerl at Schikaneders theatre Branscombe also notes the striking quality of the music that Mozart wrote for Gerl

Gerl married the soprano Barbara Reisinger 17701806 on 2 September 1789 She also sang in the Schikaneder troupe and performed the role of Papagena at the Magic Flute premiere She went with Gerl to Brno and Mannheim and died there shortly after giving birth to their second child

Nephi the Disciple
According to the Book of Mormon Nephi   the Disciple was a Nephite prophet during the 1st century and a chosen disciple of Jesus Christ Nephis ministry was centered on Christ and included prophesying of His birth working miracles in His name witnessing His visitation to the Americas after the Resurrection and administering His church after He had ascended Nephi was also the appointed recordkeeper for the Nephites during this period and much of the text of Third Nephi is abridged from his account

Nephi is first mentioned in the Book of Mormon when he inherits the Nephite records and sacred artifacts from his father Nephi son of Helaman in the year 1 BC He lived and was likely raised in the Nephite capital city Zarahemla where his father lived and subsequently departed from leaving Nephi with the full responsibilities of scribe Neither Nephis childhood nor age are referenced in the abridgement although he had at least one younger sibling Timothy It is believed that he was born in 30 BC

In the ninetysecond year of the Reign of the Judges 1 BC a great uproar broke out amongst the population over the yetunfulfilled and according to the unbelievers pastdue prophecy of Samuel the Lamanite that Christs birth would be signified by a new star and a night without darkness Those who continued to look forward to the sign of Christ were scheduled for a mass execution

Nephi deeply disturbed by the wickedness of the people prayed mightily to God for the condemned believers even all day Finally the voice of the Lord came to him saying
Lift up your head and be of good cheer for behold the time is at hand and on this night shall the sign be given and on the morrow come I into the world to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets 

As promised when the sun set that evening the sky remained as bright as midday fulfilling the anticipated prophecies and effectively preventing the impending genocide A majority of the population was converted by this event and Nephi went about baptizing unto repentance in the which there was a great remission of sins which temporarily restored peace to the land

Despite the mass change of heart and the continued preaching of Nephi and many others however by 96 ROJ AD 3 the people had already returned to wickedness and discrediting the miracles they had seen For the next twentyseven years they would continue to fluctuate between extremes of piousness and rebellion until finally abandoning their faith altogether The government of over 120 years was intentionally corrupted and assassinated into extinction and the society unraveled into tribes

Nephi having witnessed this downfall renewed his efforts and began to preach with such boldness and power that the people were angry with him even because he had greater power than they for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words

Additionally Nephi performed miracles in the name of Christ including casting out devils healing the sick and raising his brother from the dead He continued to preach and baptize throughout AD 33 converting many

In the advent of the next year the signs of Christs death three hours of unparalleled destruction followed by three days of darkness also prophesied by Samuel the Lamanite were given

White Shark Caf
The White Shark Caf is a remote midPacific Ocean area noted as a winter and spring habitat of otherwise coastal great white sharks

The area halfway between Baja California and Hawaii received its unofficial name in 2002 from researchers at Stanford Universitys Hopkins Marine Station who were studying the great white shark species using satellite tracking tags They identified a zone with a radius of approximately centered at approximately  The findings which were initially published in the January 3 2002 issue of the journal Nature showed three of four tagged sharks traveled to the Caf during a sixmonth period after they were tagged off the central coast of California

Although the area had not previously been suspected as a shark habitat when mapping the satellite tracking data researchers discovered that members of the species frequently travel to and loiter in the area It was once believed the area had very little food for the animals researchers described it as the shark equivalent of a desert but research in early 2018 by the vessel Falkor showed that there is a rich and diverse food chain too deep to be detected by satellites that provides a potentially abundant food supply for the sharks Male female and juvenile great whites have been tracked there

The sharks tracked to the area came from diverse rookeries along the North American coast They typically took up to 100 days to arrive traveling around  during which they make periodic dives as deep as  While at the Caf they dive to depths of as often as once every ten minutes

By 2006 researchers had observed consistent migration and other behavior Tracking data indicates that white sharks will leave feeding grounds near the coast in winter travel to the Caf and some may even summer near Hawaii But many linger in the Caf often for months before returning to the coast in the fall coinciding with the elephant seal breeding season a favored prey

Powder Keg A Blast into the Wilderness
Powder Keg A Blast Into The Wilderness commonly referred to as Powder Keg is a steel roller coaster at Silver Dollar City in Branson Missouri It was built in 2004 and opened in 2005 It is also the longest ride in Silver Dollar City The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group

To save on construction costs elements of the former Buzz Saw Falls Water Coaster which was manufactured by Premier Rides and was replaced by Powder Keg were used for the new ride namely the lift hill structure Other tributes to the former ride can be found in the thematic elements surrounding the queue line such as an old Buzzsaw Falls car stuck in the roof of the first queue building and a piece of old Buzzsaw track sticking out of the queue buildings roof

Before the train launches a short audio track plays A man with a deep voice says three lines as of the 2017 season

The train moves forward out of the nitro shed and a siren goes off and the stop lights go redyellowyellowgreen and flames would shoot out of the nitro shed
Soon after the train launches using compressed air and the ride starts

In 2007 one more modification to the prelaunch sequence was made where stoplights were added on the launch section to go from redyellowyellowgreen while making a siren sound and then launching like usual Before the 2007 season the nitro shed would just shoot flames and the train would launch soon after

After being launched out onto the track riders go up a relatively small hill and down a very steep drop Riders go up and down hills many times and go through several tight turns before slowly traveling up a chainlift hill equipped with audio speakers playing bluegrass music The train goes through a 90degree left turn before going down another steep drop onto a small spraypainted blue section of the track At the final end of the ride the train travels through a large helix that almost turns the track completely upside down before the train slams into the final brakes and turns into the station

Ikastola
An Ikastola  plural ikastolak is a type of primary and secondary school in the Basque Autonomous Community Navarre and to a much lesser extent the French Basque Country see Basque Country in which pupils are taught either entirely or predominantly in the Basque language Ikastolak can be nowadays either private or public divided into different networks

The Basque language public network relies on state funding and management allocated in Spain by the education institutions of the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre in their corresponding territories while in France the association IkasBi in the public network advocates for bilingual education Seaska is the private network of Basque language schools in the French Basque Country closely linked to the similar network in the Southern Basque Country The private networks base their activity on the fees paid by parents popular subscription either directly or by means of annual massive festivals eg Herri Urrats Nafarroa Oinez Araba Euskaraz etc and the allowance provided by public educational institutions

Although spoken more widely than in later times there was very little schooling undertaken in Basque before the early 20th century revival in Basque nationalism Spanish and French were mandatory in schooling at either side of the border The first official ikastola was opened in 1914 and the movement to transfer the medium of education in the Southern Basque Country from Spanish to Basque became widespread in the late 20th century 

During the early 1930s the seeds of the Basque Schools Escuelas Vascas were sown in Navarre by the Basque Nationalist Party featuring an instruction where the teachings of the Christian doctrine were central They were conceived as an attempt to counter increased laicization of state schools and the lack of focus the neutrality on Basque matters in regular religious schooling The first such educative institution was founded in November 1931 at Pamplona followed by another one in EstellaLizarra 1933 and Elizondo 1935 

Following the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War the public use of Basque was made illegal and all educational institutions were forced to teach entirely through the medium of Castilian to the complete neglect and persecution of Basque There are however isolated examples of ikastolak which clandestinely continued to teach in Basque 

Since thousands of children were studying out of the authorized schools and hence forbidden to progress to higher education in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church arranged with the parent associations the lawful Diocesan Federation of Ikastolas later becoming a secular federation With the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975 large degrees of selfgovernment were given to the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre and ikastolak sprang up all over the Basque region in northern Spain

For a time the ikastolak operated along the public school system the private schools publicly funded under a charter and the private schools During his term as Basque minister for education the Socialist Fernando Buesa proposed the 1993 Law of the Basque Public School prompting ikastolak to choose between full integration in the public system or operating under the rules for chartered private schools

At the present time tens of thousands of schoolchildren in the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre attend ikastolak but the status of ikastolak differs greatly depending on their location They are firmly entrenched in the traditionally Basquespeaking areas of the Basque Autonomous Community BAC but less so in nonBasque speaking areas ie the southern fringes Basque language schools in the north of Navarre do not enjoy the same support from the regional government as they do in the BAC but they are officially recognised and enjoy widespread local support traditionally Basque speaking unlike central and southern areas of Navarre where they lack public recognition and funding remaining in a legal limbo until 2007

In the French Basque Country the ikastolak developed later but grew steadily so much so that a network Seaska is now widespread throughout the whole territory covering education up to the A levels

Clean sweep naval
A clean sweep for a naval vessel refers to having swept the enemy from the seas a completely successful mission It is traditionally indicated by hanging a broom from a mast or lashing it to the periscope of a submarine

It is said the use of brooms in this respect originated during the 1650s when the Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp after a decisive victory in the First AngloDutch War the Battle of Dungeness of 1652 hung a broom from his mast to indicate he had swept the British from the seas  his opponent Admiral Blake is said to have responded with the hoisting of a whip indicating he would whip the Dutch into submission However both stories are legends a broom in the seventeenth century indicated the ship was for sale

The United States Submarine Service during World War II generally considered a patrol a clean sweep if the sub sank every target she engaged Individual torpedoes might miss and convoys usually had far too many ships for all to be sunk by a single boat but these unavoidable inefficiencies did not mar a clean sweep

Few wideranging war patrols have been conducted since World War II so commanding officers have taken other opportunities to fly brooms For example in the year 2000 the Military Sealift Command hung a broom from the flagpole yardarm outside their headquarters to symbolize its clean sweep of the Y2K bug on all the commands ships

In 2003 under circumstances perhaps closer to the traditional context after USS Cheyenne launched her Tomahawk missiles during Operation Iraqi Freedom her commanding officer decided that placing all missiles on target with no duds or failures was a modern clean sweep

For decades brooms have been flown by warships that successfully pass all elements of their sea trials Examples include USS Ohio in 2005 and
USS Virginia SSN774 in 2006

<doc id="7700494" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700494" title="Rhizopogon">
Rhizopogon
Rhizopogon is a genus of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes in the family Rhizopogonaceae Species form hypogeous sporocarps commonly referred to as false truffles The general morphological characters of Rhizopogon sporocarps are a simplex or duplex peridium surrounding a loculate gleba that lacks a columnella Basidiospores are produced upon basidia that are borne within the fungal hymenium that coats the interior surface of gleba locules The peridium is often adorned with thick mycelial cords also known as rhizomorphs that attach the sporocarp to the surrounding substrate The scientific name Rhizopogon is Greek for root Rhiz beard pogon and this name was given in reference to the rhizomorphs found on sporocarps of many species

Rhizopogon species are primarily found in ectomycorrhizal association with trees in the family Pinaceae and are especially common symbionts of pine fir and Douglas fir trees Through their ectomycorrhizal relationships Rhizopogon are thought to play an important role in the ecology of coniferous forests Recent micromorphological and molecular phylogenetic study has established that Rhizopogon is a member of the Boletales closely related to Suillus

The genus Rhizopogon occurs throughout the natural and introduced ranges of family Pinaceae trees Though this range covers much of the northern temperate zones the diversity of Rhizopogon species is well characterized only in North America and Europe There are currently over 150 recognized species of Rhizopogon The morphology of Rhizopogon species is highly cryptic and characters vary greatly throughout sporocarp maturity This has led to the description of multiple species from various developmental stages of a single fungus

The genus Rhizopogon was first described from Europe by Elias Magnus Fries in 1817 The North American monograph was produced by Alexander H Smith in 1966 with second author credits given posthumously to Sanford Myron Zeller due to his contributions to the study of the genus A European monograph of Rhizopogon has also been published In the recent past molecular phylogenetic methods have allowed the revision of the taxonomic concepts of the genus Rhizopogon

Modern taxonomic concepts of the genus Rhizopogon recognize five subgenera of Rhizopogon These are subgenus Rhizopogon subgenus Versicolores subgenus Villosuli subgenus Amylopogon and subgenus Roseoli

Rhizopogon species have been established as a common component in the diet of many small mammals as well as deer in Western North America The viability of Rhizopogon spores is maintained and may even be increased after mammalian gut passage making mammals an important dispersal vector for Rhizopogon

Rhizopogon species are common members of the fungal communities that colonize the roots of trees during seedling establishment and persist into old growth stands Rhizopogon spores are long lived in soil and the spores of some species can persist for at least four years with an increase in viability over time Rhizopogon seems to be especially common upon the roots of establishing tree seedlings following disturbance such as fire or logging Rhizopogon are also abundant colonizers of pot cultivated and field cultivated conifer seedlings growing in soil from conifer stands that lacked observations of Rhizopogon upon the roots of mature trees These finding suggest that Rhizopogon species are an important factor in the recovery of conifer forests following disturbance

The first intentional use of Rhizopogon species in forestry occurred in the early part of the 20th century when Rhizopogon luteolus was deliberately introduced into Pinus radiata plantations in Western Australia after it was observed to improve tree growth Since that time Rhizopogon species have been widely studied as a component of managed forests Rhizopogon species have been noted as common members of the ectomycorrhizal community colonizing tree roots of pine and Douglasfir timber plantations Naturally occurring Rhizopogon roseolus rubescens spores have been shown to outcompete the spores of other ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine plantations even when competing spores were directly inoculated onto seedlings The survival rate and performance of pine and Douglasfir plantation seedlings are increased after inoculation with Rhizopogon species

Though many species of Rhizopogon are considered edible most are not held in high culinary esteem A notable exception is Rhizopogon roseolus rubescens which is considered a delicacy in east Asia and especially in Japan where it is traditionally known as Shoro Techniques for the commercial cultivation of this fungus in pine plantations have been developed and applied with successful results in Japan and New Zealand

AntiBin Tax Campaign
The AntiBin Tax Campaign opposed the introduction of bin charges garbagecollection fees by local authorities in Ireland The campaign centred largely in city areas in particular Dublin It was locally based with some coordination in the Dublin area Nonpayment was the tactic used against the charge

The campaign was supported by a variety of people from community and minor political groupings such as Socialist Party Socialist Workers Party Irish Socialist Network Workers Solidarity Movement and Working Class Action

In Autumn 2003 after years of mass nonpayment the Dublin local authorities began noncollection leading to protests and blockades of bin trucks In the High Court Fingal County Council sought an injunction and the imprisonment of Joe Higgins and Clare Daly of the Socialist Party and Irish Socialist Network members John ONeill and Colm Breathnach These imprisonments escalated the campaign and for a number of weeks refuse collection in the Dublin area was severely disrupted due to protests In total 22 people were imprisoned

The campaign failed in its objective to reverse the introduction of bin charges In the years to follow many councils privatized refuse collection services 

The campaign was described by The Phoenix Magazine as an abject failure which left many thousands of families across Dublin in financial and legal difficulty it proved a useful campaign and publicity tool for SP candidates in a number of constituencies 

At the 2004 local elections following the noncollection phase of the campaign AntiBin Tax a number of candidates were elected The Socialist Party gained two seats one on Cork City Council and one on South Dublin County Council bringing its total up to four Joan Collins running as an Independent won a seat in the CrumlinKimmage local electoral area on Dublin City Council

Cieran Perry of Working Class Action running as an independent narrowly missed election by 93 votes in Cabra polling 1753 votes Dublin city chair of Stop the Bin Tax campaign Joe Mooney ran in the Dublin North Inner City electoral ward unsuccessfully 

Joe Mooney was involved in one of the most prominent incidents of the AntiBin Tax Campaign when he was hit by a Dublin City Council truck while the campaign tried to blockade a bin truck depot he was carried down a road by a bin truck before falling off He was slightly injured

Peshawar Club Ground
The Peshawar Club Ground is a cricket ground in Peshawar Pakistan used for one Test match between India and Pakistan It staged first class cricket matches from 1938 to 1987

The history of first class cricket at the Peshawar Club Ground began with the North West Frontier Province in the Indian Ranji Trophy With the separation of Pakistan in 1949 the NWFP team was admitted into the QuaideAzam Trophy and again played at Peshawar until they were replaced in the Trophy by a Peshawar city team in 1956 Before that Pakistan had entertained India for the only Test match to be played here In a drawn fourday encounter Polly Umrigar hit a century for India before he was run out

The following year New Zealand played a GovernorGeneral of Pakistans XI here while a fullstrength Pakistan side beat a nonTest touring team from Marylebone Cricket Club For QuaideAzam Trophy matches the Peshawar team switched between this ground and the Peshawar Gymkhana Ground until 1971 In 1957 Peshawar off spinner Haseeb Ahsan achieved the best figures on the ground with thirteen for 47 in a match against Punjab B

Touring teams occasionally visited the ground though no more Test matches were played In 1967 an MCC U25 side played a Pakistan North Zone team a match which is notable for Mike Brearleys highest first class score The visitors captain made 312 not out in a day as MCC piled up 514 for four against opposition including the later Test captain Intikhab Alam declared then won by an innings and 139 runs on the third day He shared double century stands with Alan Knott and Alan Ormrod records for the first and fifth wickets at the ground and his innings remains the highest on the ground despite Zakir Butts 290 for Pakistan Railways six years later

Matches by touring teams became more common in the 1970s with England India New Zealand Sri Lanka then not a Test nation all playing a team at this ground Most matches were drawn though England won by the use of two declarations while New Zealand lost against a team with nine players who would appear in the Test series against them An International XI captained by Vanburn Holder also beat a near fullstrength Pakistan here in 1976 though the match did not have international status

By November 1984 the new Arbab Niaz Stadium in Peshawar was ready and the Club Ground was disused It hosted Peshawar for the last time in their 198687 QuaideAzam Trophy campaign where they played eight home matches and since then the Arbab Niaz has taken over as Peshawars international and first class ground of choice

Single ODI century has been scored at the venue

Randamoozham
Randamoozham  is a 1984 Malayalam novel by Indian author M T Vasudevan Nair widely credited as his masterpiece The work won the Vayalar Award given for the best literary work in Malayalam in 1985 It also won the Muttathu Varkey Award in 1994 The novel has been translated to multiple languages It was translated into English as Second Turn in 1997 Another English translation by Gita Krishnankutty published in 2013 is titled Bhima Lone Warrior

The novel is a retelling of the Indian epic Mahabharata from the perspective of Bhima the second Pandava The story deviates from the traditional Mahabharata story as it avoids the divine elements of the ancient epic and rerepresent the characters and events realistically One of the reasons critics cite for the novels cult following is its revisionism that was a first time in Malayalam literature The book was translated to Tamil by Kurunjivelan as Irandaam Idam with cover illustration by Trotsky Marudu 

A film adaptation starring Mohanlal is scheduled for 2020 it is set to become Indias most expensive film production at US 155 million and the most expensive nonEnglishlanguage film

The story begins with the incident of Mahaprasthanika Parva where the Pandavas leave for the pilgrimage to Himalayas forsaking all the worldly possessions The story runs through the eyes of Bhima who faces seemingly severe frustrations as a young man Always destined to be second to his weak elder brother Yudhishthira in seniority and younger brother Arjuna in fame and popularity Bhima is not given his due as the main architect of the Pandava victory over their cousins Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war despite killing all the 100 Kauravas The book unravels all the hardship and dilemmas encountered by Bhima which remain unnoticed The book explores the emotions of the mighty Pandava as a son brother husband and father The book brings to light the affection that he holds for his wife draupadi and how unnoticed his acts of love remains The story questions the mourning of Arjunas son Abhimanyu when he is killed during the battle while trying to break the Chakravyuh formation while Bhimas son Ghatokkach is led to his death by sacrificing his life to save Arjunas life and his sacrifice too remains unsung and everyone enjoys the happiness of saving Arjunas life Towards the end of the book he is shown as the only husband who seems to stop trying to be with darupadi at her last moment during their pilgrimage

In 2011 director Hariharan announced his plan to adapt Randamoozham to screen scripted by M T Vasudevan Nair himself with Mohanlal cast to play Bhima Later V A Shrikumar Menon took the project again with Mohanlal in the lead it was announced in April 2017 that the film adaptation will be produced by B R Shetty With its 1000 crore 10 billion budget the film is expected to be the most expensive film in Indian cinema and the most expensive nonEnglish language film The film will be shot in two parts The first part is planned to be released in 2020 But in April 2019 it was officially announced that the film adaptation has been shelved

Xestia
Xestia is a genus of noctuid moths family Noctuidae They are the type genus of the tribe Xestiini in subfamily Noctuinae though some authors merge this tribe with the Noctuini Species in this genus are commonly known as clays darts or rustics but such names are commonplace among Noctuidae Xestia moths have a wide distribution though they most prominently occur in the Holarctic

With almost 200 species included at one time Xestia was something of a wastebin genus But almost half of the traditional species are now placed elsewhere see below and some of the remaining ones are liable to be assigned to another genus also On the other hand new moths that probably do belong in this genus are still being discovered eg X hypographa which led to the 2002 transfer of X ornata from Eugraphe to here Thus unless there are drastic taxonomic changes in the future Xestia is likely to remain one of the larger noctuine genera

Xestia adults are usually of medium size and robust build with stout hairy bodies and strong wings Some are quite colorful with bold lighter markings and hindwings in delicate yellowish reddish or bluish hues Generally they are cryptic while at rest however with unmarked pale or dull brownish hindwings they do not have metallic hues and few species possess obvious eyespots
This genus includes many species living at high latitudes and altitudes in tundra and taiga ecosystems Some have twoyear semivoltine life cycles and only occur as adults every other year typically the caterpillar larva overwinters to pupate in spring with the moths flying around midsummer but some species eclose later their moths flying from late summer into autumn Xestia caterpillars are generally stout and cryptically colored in some species they have quite prominent dark lengthwise spots but may eg be entirely green or whatever else gives best camouflage

Some species larvae are notoriously polyphagous eg the setaceous Hebrew character X cnigrum the food of which includes all sorts of core eudicots  including solanaceae and others which are poisonous to many herbivores  as well as some monocots The latter are mainly Poaceae however and few other monocots are utilized by Xestia larvae in general Ericaceae as well as Betulaceae and Poaceae are key food plants for many of the highlatitude species Gymnosperms are food plants of secondary importance in this genus but Pinaceae form the mainstay or exclusive food of some species which occasionally become more than nuisance pests Altogether Xestia moths are only known as major pests within limited areas or in regard to specific plants in which cases damage can be economically significant though

Even though the larval food plants of many Xestia species are not or insufficiently known those on record are from all major lineages of core eudicots Among the basal core eudicots Caryophyllales especially Polygonaceae are particularly significant of the asterids the Asterales especially Asteraceae Ericales especially Ericaceae and Lamiales especially Plantaginaceae and of the rosids the Malpighiales numerous families and Rosales especially Rosaceae Less important asterid orders among Xestia food plants are for example Dipsacales Gentianales and Solanales of the rosids eg Fabales Fagales Malvales Myrtales and Sapindales More basal mesangiosperms do not seem to be significant as Xestia food plants at least not in temperate and cooler regions

As far as is known Xestia adults are nocturnal or crepuscular except of course the highlatitude species but are often attracted to lights at night They general feed on flowers with relatively short or no corolla and will also drink other sugary liquids

Several species formerly placed here are now in Agnorisma and Pseudohermonassa whether other genera are accepted varies among authors Estimata Hemigraphiphora and Perinaenia are provisionally considered distinct here Xestia versuta does not seem to belong in the present genus it may be an aberrant member of Goniographa but until this is resolved it is here treated under its original name Eugraphe versuta

Furthermore a case for separation has in particular been made for Amathes possibly including Agrotiphila Lytaea Megasema possibly including Megarhomba Segetia and Schoyenia with Archanarta occasionally also separate but these are here included in Xestia Some of them are however recognized as subgenera and if the genus is split further would be first to become elevated in rank again There is no real good justification for either treatment except that the lengthy process of a thorough revision of noctuine systematics and taxonomy has only progressed so far H Beck in 1996 published a comprehensive taxonomic catalogue introducing generic names for most European groups of presumably related species While few of these seem to stand any chance ever to be widely recognized as distinct genera this step is likely to have made available a generic name for any taxa that are eventually split from Xestia sensu stricto

Junior synonyms and other obsolete generic names for Xestia moths are
The 110 or so species here placed in Xestia are divided among five subgenera Two of these are further divided into groups which are based on phenetic similarity however and may or may not form clades andor species complexes Some of these would presumably warrant recognition as subgenera if the presentday subgenera are split off the subgeneric names that would apply are given if known in the addition to the speciesgroup names

About onethird of the species here included in Xestia are incertae sedis of unclear assignment Among this group are a few species which are extremely little known having been described long ago but studied only once or twice since then

If the affiliations of the subgenera are not very much mistaken most remaining cases of erroneous assignment to Xestia are to be found among the species of uncertain group affiliation here for the recently described X kecskerago for example it was explicitly stated that placement in the present genus is tentative Other species of unclear affiliation are so little known that even their validity remains questionable though this group equally well seems to contain quite distinct lineages of true Xestia Also there are some obvious species groups which do not easily fit into the subgeneric scheme above

<doc id="7700644" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7700644" title="Aethia">
Aethia
Aethia is a genus of four small 85300g auklets endemic to the North Pacific Ocean Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk and among some of North Americas most abundant seabirds The relationships between the four true auklets remains unclear Auklets are threatened by invasive species such as Arctic foxes Alopex lagopus and Norway rats Rattus norvegicus because of their high degree of coloniality and crevicenesting

The genus Aethia occurs only in the North Pacific and adjacent waters mainly in the Bering Sea region Along with Cassins auklet Ptychoramphus aleuticus they comprise the monophyletic tribe Aethinii Molecular work has not yet resolved the relationship between the Aethia auklets but the group is a sister group to Cassins auklet which is in turn a sister group to the Fraterculine auks puffins and rhinoceros auklet

The genus Aethia did not enter into widespread use until the 1960s Initially the auklets were placed in Alca but later reorganized into genera including Simorhynchus Phaleris and Cyclorhynchus Cyclorhynchus is still occasionally used for the parakeet auklet

The first undisputed auk fossils are from the middle Miocene 15 million years ago The first Aethia fossils date from the late Miocene 813 million years ago and the four extant species likely diverged rapidly about 5 million years ago

There are one or two fossil species which lived in the area of todays California during the Late Miocene some 5 million years ago Aethia rossmoori Howard 1968 Monterrey Formation of Orange Countyand an undescribed taxon tentatively placed in this genus
From the Pliocene there are Aethia barnesi N A Smith 2013 San Mateo Formation of San Diego County California and Aethia storeri N A Smith 2013 San Mateo Formation of San Diego County California

There are four species of Aethia
Censusing breeding auklets can be difficult because they nest in hidden crevices At present population estimates are

Aethia auklets are endemic to the North Pacific Ocean and Sea of Okhotsk with notable Asian colonies in the Kuril Islands Commander Islands along the Kamchatka and Chukota Peninsulas In North America large colonies are in the Aleutian Islands Buldir Kiska Semisopochnoi and Gareloi to the Gulf of Alaska and north to the islands of the Bering Sea St Lawrence Island Pribilof Islands St Matthew Island

Auklets have high site fidelity at both the colony and crevice level although there can be a high divorce rate of up to 33 in least and crested auklets when both mates survive

Winter distribution of auklets is poorly known Whiskered auklets likely winter near to breeding colonies and many were reported by Aleuts to winter in the general area Auklets from the northern Bering Sea must move further south because of pack ice surrounding colonies during the winter

Auklets are typically very social and nest in dense colonies Parakeet auklets are more dispersed All have some form of facial ornamentation such as large crests Whiskered and crested auklets auricular plumes all four species and crested and whiskered auklets have a tangerinescented odour which may function in mate choice or species recognition although this requires more study

All Aethia auklets lay one white egg in a natural crevice and incubate for 2536 days after which a semiprecocial chick emerges and fledges after 2535 days Age at first breeding is estimated at 35 years Colony sizes are highly variable and range from less than 100 individuals to over 1 million although least and crested auklets tend to nest in greater density than parakeet and whiskered auklets

The auklets are mainly planktivores eating a variety of calanoid copepods euphausiids and other invertebrates such as jellyfish and ctenophores Winter diet has not been studied

Because they nest in crevices auklets are vulnerable to predation by rats and have been extirpated from some islands that contained Arctic foxes introduced for farming Eradication of rats from Rat Island was completed in 2008 and 2009

The large colony at Sirius Point Kiska Island Alaska perhaps the largest auklet colony in the world experienced almost complete breeding failure in 2001 and 2002 because of rat predation and disturbance and has been the focus of researchers at Memorial University of Newfoundland

Peter Ilsted
Peter Ilsted 14 February 1861  16 April 1933 was a leading Danish artist and printmaker He was most associated with domestic interior scenes
Peter Vilhelm Ilsted was born at Sakskbing in Guldborgsund Denmark He was the son of merchant Jens Peter Ilsted and Johanne Sophie Lund He was the brotherinlaw of painter Vilhelm Hammershi 18641916 He married Ingeborg Lovisa Petersen 18691945 in 1891

He came to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1878 completing his course of study in five years He made his debut at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1883 Two years later he joined a study trip across Italy to Egypt Palestine Greece and Turkey Later he visited Scotland England Holland Belgium Spain Morocco and France With support from the Cultural Ministry he traveled to the Exposition Universelle 1889 in Paris He was awarded the Eckersberg Medal in 1890 and 1899 He became an assistant at the Royal Danish Academy from 18931905 and worked periodically as a conservatorrestorer Ilsted died in Copenhagen during 1933

Peter Ilsted and Vilhelm Hammershi together with Carl Holse 18631935 were leading artists in early 20thcentury Denmark All three artists were members of the Free Exhibitions Den Frie Udstilling a progressive artists association founded in 1891 They are famous for painting images of Sunshine and Silent Rooms all in subtle colors Their works reflect the orderliness of a tranquil life  similar to the earlier works of Vermeer Their art was later referred to as the Copenhagen Interior School These interiors evoke at once a sense of calm and mystery The orderly rooms are often viewed from behindcausing one to wonder whether the scenes are really tranquil James McNeill Whistler Duret and important art critics were early admirers and collectors of Ilsteds works
While at first glance their work appears similar Ilsted and Hammershi were in fact quite different Hammershis work has an aloof austerity in contrast to Ilsteds scenes of common life Though sometimes Hammershis colorful early pictures are reminiscent of James Tissot 18361902 his work is quintessentially Danish However Ilsted was more of a technician and he made considerable contributions in the field of graphic arts Ilsteds mezzotints sometimes printed in colour  la poupe were very popular and important in his day They were an innovation in the media Ilsted exhibited his work all over Europe in London in 1907 in Germany and at the Paris Salon where Europes art community was first exposed to his work

Ilsted was a great success in his lifetime and won many awards and accolades for his work He was the only member of the group to also focus on printmaking Ilsteds achievements in mezzotints were revolutionary Some of his mezzotints most of which were created in black as well as color editions are considered among the greatest ever made His greatest contribution which T F imon 1871942 Manuel Robbe 1872 1936 and others seemingly adopted was that of inking the plate  la poupe Some art historians have argued that these three men created the technique at about the same time but without consultation This is uncertain
The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York held an important exhibition on the work of Ilsted Hammershi and Vermeer in 2001

Weather buoy
Weather buoys are instruments which collect weather and ocean data within the worlds oceans as well as aid during emergency response to chemical spills legal proceedings and engineering design Moored buoys have been in use since 1951 while drifting buoys have been used since 1979 Moored buoys are connected with the ocean bottom using either chains nylon or buoyant polypropylene With the decline of the weather ship they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s During the 1980s and 1990s a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean helped study the El NioSouthern Oscillation Moored weather buoys range from in diameter while drifting buoys are smaller with diameters of  Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number with 1250 located worldwide Wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships There are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity

The first known proposal for surface weather observations at sea occurred in connection with aviation in August 1927 when Grover Loening stated that weather stations along the ocean coupled with the development of the seaplane to have an equally long range would result in regular ocean flights within ten years Starting in 1939 United States Coast Guard vessels were being used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce

During World War II The German Navy deployed weather buoys Wetterfunkgert See  WFS at fifteen fixed positions in the North Atlantic and Barents Sea They were launched from Uboats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms 1800 metres limited by the length of the anchor cable Overall height of the body was 105 metres of which most was submerged surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres Data air and water temperature atmospheric pressure and relative humidity were encoded and transmitted four times a day When the batteries high voltage drycells for the valves and nickeliron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast were exhausted after about eight to ten weeks the unit selfdestructed

The Navy Oceanographic Meteorological Automatic Device NOMAD buoys hull was originally designed in the 1940s for the United States Navys offshore data collection program The United States Navy tested marine automatic weather stations for hurricane conditions between 1956 and 1958 though radio transmission range and battery life was limited Between 1951 and 1970 a total of 21NOMAD buoys were built and deployed at sea Since the 1970s weather buoy use has superseded the role of weather ships as they are cheaper to operate and maintain The earliest reported use of drifting buoys was to study the behavior of ocean currents within the Sargasso Sea in 1972 and 1973 Drifting buoys have been used increasingly since 1979 and as of 2005 1250drifting buoys roamed the Earths oceans

Between 1985 and 1994 an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean to monitor and help predict the El Nio phenomenon Hurricane Katrina capsized a buoy for the first time in the history of the National Data Buoy Center NDBC on August 28 2005 On June 13 2006 drifting buoy 26028 ended its longterm data collection of sea surface temperature after transmitting for 10years 4months and 16days which is the longest known data collection time for any drifting buoy The first weather buoy in the Southern Ocean was deployed by the Integrated Marine Observing System IMOS on March 17 2010

Weather buoys like other types of weather stations measure parameters such as air temperature above the ocean surface wind speed steady and gusting barometric pressure and wind direction Since they lie in oceans and lakes they also measure water temperature wave height and dominant wave period Raw data is processed and can be logged on board the buoy and then transmitted via radio cellular or satellite communications to meteorological centers for use in weather forecasting and climate study Both moored buoys and drifting buoys drifting in the open ocean currents are used Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of  Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution Other than their use as a source of meteorological data their data is used within research programs emergency response to chemical spills legal proceedings and engineering design Moored weather buoys can also act as a navigational aid like other types of buoys

Weather buoys range in diameter from  Those that are placed in shallow waters are smaller in size and moored using only chains while those in deeper waters use a combination of chains nylon and buoyant polypropylene Since they do not have direct navigational significance moored weather buoys are classed as special marks under the IALA scheme are coloured yellow and display a yellow flashing light at night

Discus buoys are round and moored in deep ocean locations with a diameter of  The aluminum buoy is a very rugged meteorological ocean platform that has long term survivability The expected service life of the platform is in excess of 20years and properly maintained these buoys have not been retired due to corrosion The NOMAD is a unique moored aluminum environmental monitoring buoy designed for deployments in extreme conditions near the coast and across the Great Lakes NOMADs moored off the Atlantic Canadian coast commonly experience winter storms with maximum wave heights approaching into the Gulf of Maine

A large network of coastal buoys near the United States is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center with deployment and maintenance performed by the United States Coast Guard For South Africa the South African Weather Service deploys and retrieves their own buoys while the Meteorological Service of New Zealand performs the same task for their country Environment Canada operates and deploys buoys for their country The Met Office in Great Britain deploys drifting buoys across both the northern and southern Atlantic oceans

Wind reports from moored buoys have smaller error than those from ships Complicating the comparison of the two measurements are that NOMAD buoys report winds at a height of  while ships report winds from a height of  Sea surface temperature measured in the intake port of large ships have a warm bias of around due to the heat of the engine room This bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000 Fixed buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of

3d Airlift Squadron
The 3rd Airlift Squadron is a squadron of the 436th Airlift Wing of the USAF It is based at Dover Air Force Base near Dover Delaware

The squadron goes back to the days of World War II when it was activated at Pope Field North Carolina in March 1942 as the 3d Air Corps Ferrying Squadron Two months later the 3d moved to India where it was stationed at Chabua Airfield Upper Assam India It was part of the IndiaChina Wing of Air Transport Command and carried supplies and equipment back and forth across The Hump The squadron was disbanded in late 1943

During the Korean War the 3rd was reconstituted at Brookley Air Force Base Alabama as the 3d Air Transport Squadron and began flying regularly scheduled airlift missions in its eight Douglas C124 Globemaster IIs to the Arctic Caribbean and South America In June 1958 the squadron moved to Charleston Air Force Base South Carolina where it continued to fly C124s until August 1965 when it transitioned into jets with the arrival of the first Lockheed C141 Starlifter

In June 1970 the squadron now the 3rd Military Airlift Squadron received the first operational Lockheed C5 Galaxy to be assigned to a Military Airlift Command MAC flying organization Three years later the 3d moved to its present home with the 436th Airlift Wing at Dover Air Force Base Aircrews of the 3d flew support missions for French troops in the Zaire peacekeeping effort For their efforts they were corecipients with a 9th Military Airlift Squadron crew of the Mackay Trophy for the 1978 airlift operation The 3d proved itself and the C5 by setting MAC records for departure reliability In 1986 the 3d received the 436th Military Airlift Wings Flying Eagle award four times for having the highest percentage of ontime departures in the wing

In April 1988 a 3d crew overcoming the difficulties of flying into unfamiliar territory airlifted drilling equipment into Semipalitinsk in the Soviet Union The mission was part of a joint nuclear weapons detonation monitoring agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union The crew was subsequently awarded the Mackay Trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year

The 3rd continues its distinct history and support of Air Mobility Command by flying humanitarian and contingency missions into such places as Southwest Asia Somalia Rwanda and Haiti The squadron participated in the firstever sixship formation flights of C5s in support of the Strategic Brigade Airdrop Test In October 2003 a crew from the 3rd Airlift Squadron landed the first Galaxy in Iraq at Baghdad International Airport Until 2004 the unit was also the only Special Operations Low Level capable unit to fly the C5 Galaxy This capability was transferred to the smaller and more modern C17 in 2001

Brothers Grimm comics
The Brothers Grimm are two sets of fictional twin supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics

The first appearance of the first Brothers Grimm came in SpiderWoman 3 These were a pair of identical magically animated mannequins created by doll collector Nathan Dolly also known as Mister Doll and his wife Priscilla During their initial appearances only one was ever seen at a time and the singular identity Brother Grimm was used instead of their true plural name After three return appearances in SpiderWoman they perished in issue 12 Though the characters were introduced while Marv Wolfman was writing SpiderWoman their origin and identities were not revealed until Mark Gruenwalds run on the series Questioned as to whether he had told Gruenwald the characters origin or Gruenwald had come up with it himself Wolfman admitted that he could not even remember if the origin he had originally envisioned for the characters was the same as the one ultimately used by Gruenwald except that Brother Grimm actually being two people was his intention from the beginning Though Wolfman could not remember how the Brothers Grimm were created he has said he is confident that their visual design must have come from series penciler Carmine Infantino I usually gave the artist a concept of what I wanted and then let them have a field day with it Carmine created brilliant designs in The Flash so I would certainly have bowed to his expertise

The second Brothers Grimm appeared in Iron Man 188 They would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known supervillains in a group called the Night Shift

Mister Doll was a criminal who could mystically harm a person by harming a doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victims Later in the process of creating the Brothers Grimm dolls Nathans consciousness was trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins These mannequins mailed themselves to Nathans wife Priscilla and transferred their life forces into two life size versions She named them Jake and William after the historical Brothers Grimm and believed them to be her sons a delusion which they played along with

The brothers had sharply opposed personalities rarely could come to agreement and as such pursued separate criminal careers William though timid and shy in his civilian personality was a flamboyant confrontational jokester in his Brother Grimm guise After debuting with a robbery of a theatre he pursued the more lucrative pursuit of stealing from diamond merchants In contrast Jake was flirtatious in his civilian identity but cold and dispassionate as Brother Grimm preferring less publicly visible crimes such as extortion He was also less skilled with his abilities than William while William was able to consistently defeat SpiderWoman Jake was defeated in both his confrontations with her and William had to free him from prison William was later hired by Pyrotechnics to capture SpiderWoman and succeeded

Priscilla planned to use her occult knowledge to transfer Nathans mind from the mannequins to a living human body To this end Jake abducted Jerry Hunt to use for the body and William captured SpiderWoman to coerce Magnus the Sorcerer to perform the transfer SpiderWoman pulled Hunt out of the spell at the last moment and Nathans consciousness dispersed

Twin brothers Percy and Barton Grimes are born in Fresno California They work as realtors and while exploring a theatre they own they find the original Brothers Grimm mannequins On a whim they decide to try the costumes on and become gifted with the powers of the original pair As the Brothers Grimm they terrorize a restaurant belonging to a business rival and then battle Iron Man II Tony Stark deduced their true civilian identities and the police arrested the brothers

The Brothers Grimm later became professional criminals and join the Night Shift and team with Captain America against the Power Broker and his augmented mutates With the rest of the Night Shift the Brothers test Moon Knight to take over as their leader Alongside the Night Shift they next battle the West Coast Avengers The Brothers Grimm are among a large group of supervillains who attack Hawkeye Mockingbird and Trick Shot in an attempt to collect the reward being paid by Crossfire to the first person who gives him Hawkeyes arm

During the Acts of Vengeance storyline the Brothers Grimm are freed from prison by the Wizard They battle a cosmicpowered SpiderMan and are defeated Alongside Graviton Titania Trapster and Goliath IV the Brothers are hired by the Chameleon to kill SpiderMan They are then tricked into attacking the Kingpin and defeated by SpiderMan Alongside Mockingbird and the Werewolf they help the Shroud defeat a street gang

The Brothers then briefly rejoin the Night Shift under the leadership of the new Hangman and the Night Shifts powers are increased by Satannish They battle the Avengers West Coast again but are defeated

The Brothers are later depicted as prisoners in the Raft a high security prison for costumed criminals and escape

The Brothers Grimm are later hired by the Hood to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act They are later captured by Nighthawk and Gargoyle and sent back to jail

In Secret Invasion the Brothers Grimm appear as part of the Hoods alliance with superpowered heroes the grouping is intent on defeating the Skrull invasion force of New York City They are later seen as part of the Hoods criminal gang that is sent by Norman Osborn to attack the New Avengers

The Brothers Grimm are seen to be among the new recruits for Camp HAMMER Tigra beats Percy severely and leaves a note for his brother reading Youre next

The Brothers Grimm were seen during the battle of Camp HAMMER until the Hood ordered his men including the Brothers Grimm to teleport to aid Osborn in Siege of Asgard After the battle was over the Brothers Grimm were arrested along with other members of the Hoods gang

The Brothers Grimm were later recruited by Max Fury to join the Shadow Councils incarnation of the Masters of Evil

The Brothers Grimm were among the criminals who attempted to fulfill a lucrative contract Daredevil put out on himself but were quickly defeated by him

During the Search for Tony Stark arc the Brothers Grimm rejoined Hoods gang and assisted in the attack on Castle Doom

During the SpiderGeddon storyline the Brothers Grimm are with Night Shift members Dansen Macabre Digger Skein and new member Waxman when they rob a bus until they are attacked by Superior Octopus Superior Octopus agrees to spare them more pain in exchange that the Night Shift becomes his agents where he will compensate them from his own funds They agree to the terms and are ordered to return the stolen items Superior Octopus leaves advising them never to cross him or they wont live long enough to regret it

Both pairs of Brothers Grimm had powers which were somehow related to the Brothers Grimm mannequins built by Nathan Dolly Both pairs of Brothers Grimm possess the ability to conjure with the appearance of sleight of hand a variety of small novelty items from within their costumes Each of these items has a unique offensive capability long strands of nearly unbreakable thread corrosive filled eggs pies filled with blackbirds paralytic stardust fastgrowing bean seeds and many others have been used They could also emit poisonous smoke from their hands They could fly by means of floating fivepointed stars and small cloud banks which are somehow solid enough to stand on

Shariff Kabunsuan
Shariff Kabunsuan was a shortlived province of the Philippines within the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ARMM that existed from 2006 to 2008 Its designated seat of government was Datu Odin Sinsuat Initially comprising ten municipalities carved out of Maguindanao Shariff Kabunsuan was created by virtue of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No 201 this law was nullified by the Supreme Court of the Philippines in 2008 thus disestablishing the province

Shariff Kabunsuan was established under Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No 201 which provided for the creation of the new province comprising the nine municipalities of Barira Buldon Datu Odin Sinsuat Kabuntalan Matanog Parang Sultan Kudarat Sultan Mastura and Upi all of the first legislative district of the mother province of Maguindanao A tenth municipality Datu Blah T Sinsuat was created within the proposed province on 16 September 2006 weeks prior to the actual plebiscite for the creation of the province

The plebiscite for the creation of the province was held on 28 October 2006 Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No 201 was ratified by the affirmative majority 285372 votes cast in a plebiscite thus establishing the province Only 8802 voted for its rejection

The law establishing Shariff Kabunsuan was enacted by the Regional Assembly for the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao the first such province established by that local body which had been so empowered under Republic Act No 9054 or the Expanded ARMM law Shariff Kabunsuan was the first province since Philippine independence that was not established through an Act of Congress

At the time of its creation Shariff Kabunsuan was the Philippines 80th province and the sixth in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao The province was named after Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan an ArabMalay Islamic preacher who introduced Islam to central Mindanao in the 16th century

An eleventh municipality was established two months after the creation of Northern Kabuntalan by virtue of Muslim Mindanao Autonomy Act No 205 was affirmed in a plebiscite held on 30 December 2006

Datu Odin Sinsuat was designated the capital of the new province per Section 1 of MMA Act 201 Cotabato City which is an independent city that does not vote for provincial officials belongs to neither Maguindanao nor Shariff Kabunsuan However for the purposes of congressional representation the said city was grouped with Shariff Kabunsuan as per Section 5 of MMA Act No 201 This specific provision became the subject of the Supreme Court case that led to the disestablishment of the province

On 17 July 2008 the Supreme Court in Sema v Comelec declared the creation of the province of Shariff Kabunsuan void and ruled that the power of ARMMs legislature to create provinces and cities is unconstitutional The Supreme Court in particular held that only the Congress of the Philippines was empowered to create provinces and cities because the creation of such necessarily included the power to create legislative districts which explicitly under the Philippine Constitution was within the sole prerogative of Congress to establish Consequently the Court also declared the power of the Regional Assembly to create provinces and cities within the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao as unconstitutional

Despite a motion for reconsideration filed by ARMM officials the Supreme Court reaffirmed its ruling in January 2009 thereby rendering its decision as final

Shariff Kabunsuan was composed of 11 municipalities distributed between two Sangguniang Panlalawigan districts

David Lewis Jesuit priest
David Lewis 1616  27 August 1679 was a Jesuit Catholic priest and martyr who was also known as Charles Baker Lewis was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales and is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church

Lewis the youngest of nine children of Anglican Reverend Morgan Lewis the headmaster of a grammar school and Margaret Pritchard a Catholic was born at Abergavenny Monmouthshire Wales in 1616

At 16 years of age while visiting Paris he converted to Catholicism from Anglicanism and subsequently went to study at the English College in Rome where he assumed the alias Charles Baker a common practice to avoid spies and informers in the employ of the Crown He was ordained a Catholic priest on 20 July 1642 Three years later he joined the Society of Jesus
He came back to his native place and worked for a year and then he was appointed the Spiritual Director to the seminarians at the English College in Rome After his mission in Rome had been completed he came back to Wales and was working for 30 years in the apostolate paying much attention to the poor people and people in need

He was arrested on 17 November 1678 at St Michaels Church Llantarnam then in Monmouthshire and condemned at the Assizes in Monmouth in March 1679 as a Catholic priest and for saying Catholic Masses He was being accused of attempting to kill Charles II and trying to restore Catholic faith in the land of Wales He was betrayed by an apostate couple who had been promised an award of 50 pounds for the Jesuits capture and another sum of 200 pounds was promised by a Welsh magistrate to those who could help in his exposure Like John Wall and John Kemble he was then sent to London to be examined by Titus Oates the originator of the Popish Plot and other informers

He was brought for trial at the Lenten Assizes in Monmouth on 16 March 1679 He was brought to the bar on a charge of high treason  for having become a Catholic priest and then remaining in England contrary to the Jesuits etc Act 1584

He pleaded not guilty to the charge of being an accessory to the Popish Plot but five or six witnesses claimed they had seen him say Mass and perform other priestly duties For this Lewis was found guilty and sentenced to death by Sir Robert Atkyns The condemned priest was brought to Newgate Prison in London with John Kemble Herefordshire and questioned about the plot Oates and his fellow informers William Bedloe Stephen Dugdale and Miles Prance were unable to prove anything against him Lord Shaftesbury advised him that if he gave evidence about the plot or renounced his Catholic faith that his life would be spared and he would be greatly rewarded Lewis said in his dying speech discover the plot I could not as I knew of none and conform I would not for it was against my conscienceHis last words before execution were very touching and full of faith
He was finally brought back to Usk in Monmouthshire for his execution by John Arnold of Monmouthshire prayed at the Gunter Mansion and was hanged on 27 August 1679 and then posthumously disemboweled It was a tribute to the great esteem in which he was held that the crowd who were mainly Protestants insisted that he be allowed to hang until he was dead and that he receive a proper burial The Sheriff who knew and liked Lewis registered a silent protest by refusing to attend the execution which he had postponed for as long as he could

After the Titus Oates affair 167980 the remaining Welshspeaking Catholic clergy were either executed or exiled Lewis was the last Welshman to become a Jesuit until 2001 more than 300 years later

Together with John Wall John Kemble and 37 other martyrs David Lewis was canonized by Pope Paul VI in 1970  the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales In November 2007 a plaque was erected on the spot where Lewis was arrested near Llantarnam Abbey

Manikata
Manikata is a small village in the limits of Melliea in the northwestern part of Malta It oversees the farming areas in the valley between ilBallut and ilManikata Population 539 Families 40

The main industry of Manikata is farming The valleys around this village are rich in produce All year round the fields are tended and the produce is enjoyed by many Grapes tomatoes potatoes onions melons bettieg water melons dullieg apples oranges pomegranates rummien strawberries and many other crops are commonly seen in the fields Also there are many beekeepers in this area

Literally translates into Apples Spring It is located just east of Golden Bay one of three bays Gnejna Bay Gajn Tuffiea  Golden Bay carved out of the cliffs It is situated at the bottom of Wied talPwales Pwales stream The sea is deep blue and aquamarine water interspersed with emerald and white stretches of sand

Golden Bay IlMixquqa is another one of the few sandy beaches located on the southern coast of Malta The sand at the edge of the water at this bay is peppered with small pebbles and reaching the water can be tricky The water here can be quite rough at times As you swim away from the beach the currents can be quite strong This is one of the best places for sunsets on the Maltese islands The water shimmers as the sun hits the horizon 

A lot of cart ruts are found around Manikata These probably date to a period between the Bronze Age and the Roman Era One particular line of cart ruts surfaces from under the trees in the Miieb area proceeds towards the parish church and goes towards the cliffs hanging above Mejjiesa Bay

In the area of Ilnien ta Gajn Tuffiea there are the remains of Roman baths that formed part of a rural villa Nearer to Manikata there are several Roman tombs Some of them have been obliterated when people cut across the cliff side to level the ground and make space for their fields Other tombs are found in caves and have been modified by subsequent cave inhabitants to be used as storage space Some tombs were used as airraid shelters during World War Two

During the Middle Ages the lands at Gajn Tuffiea and Manikata were used for the cultivation of crops and fruit trees Fields belonged to land owners from the capital city Mdina and its suburb Rabat The farmers usually inhabited the caves in the vicinity The caves also housed sheep goats and oxen People also used to come here to collect fire wood A night watch was kept over the sea cliffs of Gajn Tuffiea by men from Mosta forming part of the civil corps called Dejma

On the 18th of May 1565 the Turkish fleet anchored in the bays around Manikata namely Mejjiesa Mixquqa Golden Bay Gajn Tuffiea and nejna The following day it arrived at Marsaxlokk Bay to the South East where Turkish soldiers landed to begin their assault on Birgu the general headquarters of the Order

In 1637 Grand Master Lascaris came to Gajn Tuffiea to lay the foundation stone of Gajn Tuffiea Tower Grand Master Lascaris also built other watch towers at nejna Qawra and Binemma He also built Saint Agathas Tower the red tower dominating Melliea Bay

Towards the end of the Orders reign coastal entrenchments were built over Mixquqa Bay Golden Bay near modernday Golden Sands Hotel These were meant to prevent enemy troops from landing on the sandy beach below

From 1902 onwards a number of farmers in Manikata and Gajn Tuffiea lost a vast amount of agricultural land which was taken over by the Admiralty for the construction of a Royal Marines Training Centre The Gajn Tuffiea Camp consisted of shooting ranges and residential quarters for soldiers their families and camp officials During World War One 19141917 the camp was covered in tents and used as a military hospital to cure wounded soldiers that were brought here from the war front People from Manikata used to work in this emergency hospital as nurses 

In 1935 Benito Mussolini the Fascist ruler of Italy invaded Abbisinia modern Ethiopia in Africa The British suspected that Mussolini would attempt to invade Malta So they built a number of coastal defences called beach posts These were built of concrete and camouflaged with rubble walls Two such beach posts were built in Manikata in 1935 one near Gajn Tuffiea Tower and one near the Razzett talQasam When the Second World War eventually broke out more beach posts were built along the coast These were provided with a search light in order to spot enemy aircraft Over Gajn Tuffiea Gardens an antiaircraft battery was also built Due to the presence of the Admiralty camp Manikata was often a target during airraids The residents used to take shelter in rockcut airraid shelters in caves or in Roman tombs

Manikata is home to about 1000 inhabitants New houses apartments and villas have been built recently People from different parts of the Maltese islands have come to live here in search of serenity and beautiful surroundings Many local villagers are fulltime or parttime farmers Their fields are found in the surrounding areas known as ilnien ta Gajn Tuffiea Gajn Tuffiea Gardens ilWila ta Gajn Tuffiea Gajn Tuffiea meadow ilMiieb woodland and ixXagra lamra The red garrigue Every last Sunday in August the parish celebrates the feast of StJoseph On the eve of the parish feast the local community celebrates Lejla Sajfija gaiffa a Summer Breeze Night where the villagers put their best talents and products on show including songs drama paintings hand crafts vegetables fruits honey wine olive oil

In the northeast of the Manikata church there is a medium barren land called TalQarga This land contains a number of archaeological remains mainly cartruts old quarry and walls built of large stones In the land there is a girna and in the west of the structure there is a wall some 8 metres long and in it there are five large stones Parallel to this wall there is another wall which has six large stones On top of the hill there is another wall and it there are three large stones the largest one is 075m length and 06m breath Apart from this wall there are another two built from large stones It seems that during the Bronze Age period in this area there was a prehistoric village and it was defended by several walls against their enemies The idea of building a village on a hill and surround it by a defensive wall is a typical characteristic of the Bronze Age Period Bor inNadur This site has evidence of hut foundations and has the longest defensive wall of the Bronze Age Period Bor inNadur wall is the best preserved prehistoric fortification in Malta

A pillbox can be found built in Manikata at the rear of Gajn Tuffiea Camp Pillboxes were the last type of fortification to be built in Melliea and Malta These types of military structures were constructed in nearly every part of the Island It seems that the largest number of pillboxes was built in Melliea and fortunately the largest number of them survived to this day The first building programme of pillboxes occurred in 1935

Gajn Tuffiea Tower was built in 1637 on the top of the cliffs at the western edge of Gajn Tuffiea Bay During the Middle Ages ilMahras maintained a watchpost in Gajn Tuffiea probably in the same site where the tower was built This is one of the seven towers built by Grand Master Lascaris during the times of the Knights of Malta This tower has a longish shape and the ground floor room is larger than the second floor one It was armed with pdr cannon and was manned by four men a captain and three men

Unfortunately the cliffs around this Tower are eroding very badly Serious cracks are visible on the surface of the cliffs near the Tower and huge holes can be seen on the wall of the cliffs This tower may eventually collapse when the terrain on which its built gives in

The Old Chapel of St Joseph was built in 1920 when there were only twelve families living in Manikata A number of people from this tiny village helped to build this chapel Locals recall how the soft honeycoloured stone was brought from Qasam Barrani quarry while stronger stone for the arches was brought from quarries in the north of Mosta But with the growth of Manikata to over five hundred people the chapel of St Joseph which seated only 100 became too small for the religious needs of the locals

In 1961 it was decided to build a new and larger church the rector Fr Manwel Grima approached architect Edwin England Sant Fournier to prepare a design for the new church However shortly afterwards Edwin handed over the job to his son Richard England The building of the new church of Manikata faced numerous problems In 1962 the first stone was laid by Archbishop Sir Michael Gonzi but after the death of Fr Grima the church remained half built for five years Finally Manikatas new church was finished and blessed on 29 November 1974 by Archbishop Sir Michael Gonzi more than ten years after he officially had laid the first stone

The architect Richard England who built the church took his inspiration from the girna which one sometimes sees in the middle of a field a small stone building put up by farmers to store in it their implements

On the outskirts of Manikata there were two military camps in the 1960s One was home to Royal Malta Artillery and the other was a British Army camp which hosted many different regiments including the Royal Marines These army camps are no longer active

Salvatore Mancuso
Salvatore Mancuso Gmez also known as el Mono MancusoSantander Lozada or Triple Cero ie Triple Zero or 000 among other names born August 17 1964 in Montera Crdoba is a Colombian paramilitary leader once second in command of the United SelfDefense Forces of Colombia AUC paramilitary group The paramilitary groups commanded by Mancuso fought the guerrillas mainly EPL FARC and ELN and financed their activities by receiving donations from land owners drug trafficking extortions and robbery

The AUC committed numerous atrocities and massacres against presumed guerrilla members and the civilian population Mancuso was initially jailed in a Maximum Security Prison in Itag Antioquia after a peace process that led to his demobilization and then transferred to a prison in the city of Ccuta to help establish the whereabouts of some of the victims In a surprise move by the Colombian government Mancuso along with 13 other top members of the AUC was extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges

Mancuso was born in Montera the provincial capital of Crdoba Department in the northern Colombian Caribbean Region His father was an Italian immigrant from Sapri and his mother a Montera native He is the second of six children He studied civil engineering in the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana and later farming administration in the Escuela de Formacin Tcnica Agrcola in Bogot He also studied English at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania

He became a prominent landowner in Crdoba Department and in 1995 he joined the Autodefensas Campesinas de Crdoba y Urab paramilitary group citing being tired of guerrilla extortion and abuses that the Colombian authorities failed to prosecute The attacks by the guerrillas to the estate owners in the region brought as a consequence the formation of illegally armed selfdefense groups to confront them This new movement had the sympathy of some sectors of the Colombian Government such as politicians and some security forces including thencurrent and former members of the Colombian National Army The group was originally under the command of Carlos Castao with Mancuso as his main Lieutenant

The paramilitary groups in Colombia later expanded and in April 1997 created what was known as Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia AUC an umbrella organization under the leadership of the Autodefensas Campesinas de Crdoba y Urab led by Mancuso and Castao Following the death of Castao Mancuso became the strong man along with Castaos brother Vicente and consequently the main leader in the peace process with the Colombian government of president lvaro Uribe

His name has been involved in the command of at least eight paramilitary groups that perpetrated several massacres such as Mapiripn On September 24 2002 Salvatore Mancuso and Juan Carlos Sierra Ramirez were formally charged by the Colombian and the American governments for narcotrafficking The US Government applied for his extradition to the United States in order to be judged by an American court Marcuso was so unconcerned about it that he attended the ceremony of the Bloque Bananeros demobilization following the peace process with the Colombian State on November 24 2004 The extradition application was initially accepted by government of Colombia but soon was suspended to complete the demobilization process of the AUC Mancuso demobilized officially and surrendered to the Colombian authorities in the Bloque Catatumbos demobilization ceremony on December 10 2006 Gonzo author Matthew Thompson describes his 2006 meeting with Mancuso in Montera in My Colombian Death 2008

On January 15 2007 Mancuso admitted his crimes to a Colombian court following a deal that his attorneys were pursuing to preclude his extradition to the United States for drug trafficking According to the countrys Justice and Peace Law Mancuso should reveal trafficking routes and drug contacts in order to completely fulfill the deal

During his Colombian imprisonment Mancuso had his own website and criticized the Colombian government led by lvaro Uribe Vlez on numerous occasions Many politicians members of the National Army and government officials he claimed had links with the AUC

In the early morning of May 13 2008 Mancuso and thirteen other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holgun they had been refusing to comply to the countrys Peace and Justice law and were therefore extradited to the United States During his first appearance before the District of Columbia Court Mancuso refused to speak after having said his name His lawyer pleaded not guilty for him

The National Movement of State Crimes a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence has asked to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims since they have not told all of the truth have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims and have not dismantled their criminal structures 

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia stated that  according to Colombian law the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previouslysuspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the Law of Justice and Peace and for the loss of the benefits established therein

The InterAmerican Commission stated that this affects the Colombian States obligation to guarantee victims rights to truth justice and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice systems regular criminal procedures It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders  A 2016 investigation by the New York Times found that the extradited paramilitaries including Mancuso had been given special treatment by the US justice system serving shorter sentences than would be expected for drugtrafficking offences of that magnitude a number of judges and prosecutors involved in trying the cases publicly stated their admiration for the political cause of the AUC which they saw as a mitigating factor

After his extradition to the United States Colombian paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process On November 18 2008 Revista Semana reported on Mancusos declarations about the 1997 El Aro massacre in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the Colombian military and police

Mancuso testified that in the early 2000s the AUC had met with antiChavez factions in Venezuela to discuss the AUC possibly operating against the Chavez government

Immediately after his extradition Colombian police seized Mancusos luxury ranches farms and plots of land with a combined property value of US25 million

On June 5 2008 Several Colombian media reported police in Montera found a suitcase allegedly containing Mancusos shadow administration revealing more property owned by the warlord through secret associates

2007 Major League Baseball AllStar Game
The 2007 Major League Baseball AllStar Game was the 78th midseason exhibition between the allstars of the American League AL and the National League NL the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball The game was held on July 10 2007 at ATT Park the home of the NLs San Francisco Giants It marked the third time that the Giants hosted the All Star Game since moving to San Francisco for the 1958 season The 1961 and 1984 All Star Games were played at the Giants former home Candlestick Park and the fourth overall in the Bay Area with the Giants bay area rivals the Oakland Athletics hosting once back in 1987 and the second straight held in an NL ballpark

The American League defeated the National League by a score of 54 Ichiro Suzuki won the MVP award for the game for hitting the first insidethepark home run in AllStar history As per the 2006 Collective Bargaining Agreement the American League champion which eventually came to be the Boston Red Sox received home field advantage in the 2007 World Series The victory was the 10th consecutive excluding the 2002 tie for the AL and their 11game unbeaten streak is only beaten by the NLs 11game winning streak from 1972 to 1982 in AllStar history

As with each AllStar Game since 1970 the eight starting position players with no designated hitter due to playing in an NL stadium of each league were elected by fan balloting The remaining players were selected by a players vote each leagues team manager and a second fan balloting to add one more player to each roster In all 32players were selected to each leagues team not including players who decline to play due to injuries or personal reasons

The Giants were awarded the game on February 9 2005 The game marked the first time since 1962 that one league hosted consecutive AllStar Games after Pittsburgh Pennsylvania hosted the game in 2006

The game was the fifth straight AllStar Game to decide homefield advantage in the World Series The AL entered the game on a tengame unbeaten streak nine wins with one tie in 2002 The NL was looking for their first win since the 1996 game in Philadelphia

Umpires for the game were announced on June 14 Bruce Froemming the most tenured current umpire in Major League Baseball was named crew chief for the game It was also revealed that day that Froemming would retire following the 2007 season

The National League got things started in the bottom of the first when Jos Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and proceeded to steal second He scored on an RBI single by Ken Griffey Jr to give the NL a 10 lead Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for in the bottom of the third when with Reyes on second he lofted a high fly ball to left field but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordez The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a twoout single by Ivn Rodrguez However the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning The AL would score one inning later when after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall Instead of caroming straight to Griffey the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffeys right This allowed Ichiro to score on what is still the only insidethepark home run in AllStar Game history The homer gave the AL a 21 lead and resulted in Ichiros MVP win

The lead would be augmented in the sixth when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires call The NL got a run back in the bottom of the inning when Carlos Beltrn led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey The AL added some insurance runs in the eighth when Vctor Martnez hit a tworun home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 52 lead

The American Leagues closers then entered the game with Jonathan Papelbon pitching a scoreless bottom of the eighth In the ninth JJ Putz tried to earn the save and began by inducing a weak popup and striking out Brian McCann Pinchhitter Dmitri Young rolled a ground ball deep in the hole to Brian Roberts but he could not come up with it Alfonso Soriano followed with a tworun home run to right field to cut the NLs deficit to one After Putz walked J J Hardy AL manager Jim Leyland replaced him with Francisco Rodrguez However Rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked Derrek Lee on a checkswing 32 pitch and then Orlando Hudson to load the bases In a move that drew criticism La Russa elected not to pinchhit his last player on the bench Albert Pujols and instead let Aaron Rowand hit Rowand lofted a fly ball to right field that was caught by Alex Ros to close the game earning the American League their tenth consecutive victory

The State Farm Home Run Derby was held the night before the AllStar Game July 9 and broadcast on ESPN Four players from each league competed to hit as many home runs as they could in each round to advance and eventually win the contest This year a fiveswing swingoff would be used to break ties occurring in any round This became necessary when Albert Pujols and Justin Morneau tied for fourth in the first round The champion of last years Derby Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies competed even though he was not named to the NL AllStar roster

In the finals Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated Alex Ros of the Toronto Blue Jays by a score of 32 Guerrero hit 17 home runs in all second only to Ros 19 Guerrero also hit the longest blast of the competition a drive to left field that just missed hitting a giant replica glove and baseball set up on the concourse beyond the left field bleachers

ATT Park is distinguished by having the San Francisco Bay beyond its right field bleachers The body of water located adjacent to the ballpark is known as McCovey Cove named for legendary Giants slugger Willie McCovey McCovey Cove is known for having many fans sitting in the water in kayaks and boats hoping to retrieve a long home run ball hit there Though dozens of fans waited in the cove during the Derby no home runs were actually hit into the water either on the fly or off the promenade next to the right field seats though one foul ball hit by Prince Fielder did reach the water This was largely due to the three lefthanded competitors all exiting in the first round as well as wind currents blowing toward left field Prior to the AllStar break a total of 58 home runs were hit into the cove on the fly during the parks history

Gold balls were utilized whenever any player had one out remaining during his round Any home runs hit with the balls meant Major League Baseball and State Farm would pledge to donate money to the Boys  Girls Clubs of America Due to the change in sponsors from Century 21 to State Farm each balls value was reduced to US17000 to reflect the 17000 State Farm agents in the United States and Canada In all twelve gold ball home runs were hit which along with a 50000 bonus constituted 254000 raised for charity

Ciudad Vieja Montevideo
Ciudad Vieja  Old City is the name of the oldest part of the city of Montevideo capital city of Uruguay Nowadays Ciudad Vieja is a barrio neighbourhood or district of this city In the last couple of years it has gone through a major transformation that has made it the main nightlife centre in town It is in this area where most of the nightclubs are and also it hosts the Mercado del Puerto a traditional venue for Uruguayan food and beverages The main port of Uruguay being the main Big Draft port in southern South America is located in Ciudad Vieja

Part of this transformation is due to the campaign made by the mayor since this part of the city had been in a state of abandonment for decades

Until 1829 it was surrounded by a wall that protected it from possible invasions After the wall was torn down the only part of it that was kept was its gateway which is up to this day an emblem of this part of town Some streets recall the presence of the wall like Ciudadela citadel or Brecha breach which has this name because it was near but at this point that the British managed to open a breach on the wall during the 1807 British invasion The old street Sarand was turned into a pedestrian walkway in 1992 which increased its commercial and tourist attractiveness In 2005 it was extended to beyond the Constitution Square

Ciudad Vieja has the most beautiful buildings from the colonial era and the first decades of independence The Cabildo built between 1804 and 1812 the Sols Theatre the Metropolitan Cathedral and several museums like the Museo Torres Garca are among the most impressive ones Also several design shops and recycled loft floors flourish in the streets near the port

Several temples have been built in the historic heart of the city

The National Meat Institute INAC a government agency has its headquarters here

Patriote popular assemblies
The Patriote popular assemblies gathered supporters and leaders of the Patriote movement and the Parti patriote in 1837 Lower Canada The assemblies concentrated in the Montreal and Montrgie region saw votes on resolutions and speeches of some of Lower Canadas most reputed orators

The resolutions and the speeches often protested against the Russell Resolutions and what the Patriotes saw as the injustice of the colonial government that imposed its will by force and without the direct democratic participation of the people A number of occasions honored Patriote leader LouisJoseph Papineau The text of the resolutions were often prepared by members of a permanent central committee in Montreal Speeches also appealed to either economic boycotts of British products or to an armed uprising Papineau believed in the former while Wolfred Nelson became a proponent of the latter

Often allusions were also made to the great liberty of the United States of America and the possible support for Lower Canada that could arise in the neighbouring republic The American Revolution was indeed a major influence of the Patriote movement and its rebellion Ultimately the United States would be of little help to the coming Lower Canada Rebellion despite plans by American northeastern citizens to provide weapons and the passive role that country played hosting the Frres chasseurs and the hunted and banished Patriotes notably Papineau They eventually proclaimed their neutrality and in January 1838 American President Martin Van Buren even cautioned Americans against any assistance or protection declaring that anyone who would compromise the neutrality of the United States would expose themselves to arrestation and punishment

Following the conclusion of World War II Korean weather support was managed by the 20th Weather Squadron headquartered in Japan The lone Air Force weather detachment in Korea was closed in September 1949

Mobile units of the 20th returned to Korea the next year at the start of the Korean War The 30th Weather Squadron was soon reactivated with its headquarters in Korea to support the Fifth Air Force and other United Nations Forces Within one month the units headquarters were forced to retreat south from Seoul to Taegu It remained in Taegu until July 1951 when it returned to Seoul In 1954 the headquarters moved to Osan Air Base

After the end of the Korean War the 30th Weather Squadron began to turn over several of its locations to the Republic of Korea ROK Air Force In 1957 headquarters of the 30th moved from Korea to Japan to oversee the weather detachments in Korea and Japan with the inactivation of the 20th Weather Squadron In 1957 the 30th was assigned to the 10th Weather Group In 1959 the 30th was inactivated and its detachments assigned directly to the 10th Weather Group The 10th Weather Group was inactivated in 1960

From 1960 to 1964 the remaining USAF weather units in Korea reported directly to the First Weather Wing located at Hickam AFB Hawaii In 1964 the 20th Weather Squadron was reactivated at Fuchu Air Station Japan and again took responsibility for managing the USAF weather units in Korea In 1974 20th Weather Squadron headquarters moved to Yokota AB Japan and continued to manage USAF weather support in Korea until it was inactivated on 1 September 1976

Because the 51st Weather Squadron was not under the operational control of the 51st Fighter Wing at Osan AB the decision was made in July 1993 to replace it with the reactivated 5th Weather Squadron which had a long lineage of battle decorations from the Pacific Theater in World War II and the Vietnam War

Another USAF restructuring of Numbered Air Forces and a drive toward standardized naming conventions caused the Air Force to inactivate the 5th Weather Squadron and to activate the 607th Weather Squadron in December 1994 Today the 607th Weather Squadron is part of the 607th Air Support Operations Group 7th Air Force Pacific Air Forces

Faqir Mohammed
Maulvi Faqir Mohammed PashtoUrdu  1970 is a member of the Mamund tribe in Bajaur Agency and until March 2012 a deputy leader of the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group TehrikiTaliban Pakistan He was reported as killed on 5 March 2010 during a helicopter gunship attack on militants by the Pakistani military although he denied the reports as false In July 2011 he resurfaced on the air broadcasting radio shows out of Afghanistan
He was captured in Afghanistan on February 17 2013

He was born in Chopatra in Bajaur Agency Pakistan Until the age of 20 he was a student unknown for any militancy He began his education studying in a local madrassa under Maulana Abdus Salam His first mentor was Maulana Sufi Mohammad to whom he was introduced in 1993 at the age of 22 Sufi Mohammad is the founder of TehreekeNafazeShariateMohammadi TNSM or Movement for the Enforcement of Islamic Laws

He has one wife in a tribal society where polygamy is not uncommon

Mohammed was a staunch activist of TNSM He and his two sons were captured in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban in late 2001 and were held in Dera Ismail Khan jail in southern Pakistan However he successfully fled back to Pakistan where his knowledge of the territory has been useful to AlQaeda operatives

His house was raided by Pakistani security agencies hunting a highvalue alQaeda target in 2005 Public sympathy raised him into a position of leadership in the Bajaur Agency His house was raided again on 22 January 2006 and three of his relatives were arrested He is a wanted man due to suspected contacts with Taliban and AlQaeda militants Faqir has publicly stated that he has close ties to Ayman alZawahiri
For his part Faqir Mohammed strongly denies any presence of alQaeda or Taliban leadership in the area and says According to Pashtun tradition we will definitely exact revenge on America Ayman alZawahiri never came here but if he wanted to come we will welcome him and it will be a great pleasure for us to be his host Daily Jang 23 January 2006 President Pervez Musharraf however is insistent that alQaeda fighters were probably killed in a suspected CIA air strike that killed 18 civilians in Bajaur Agency earlier this monthnow that we have started investigating the reality on the ground yes we have found that there are foreigners there that is for sure The Nation 25 January 2006

He commented on the Chenagai airstrike which occurred in October 2006

Though not a tribal chief or elder he has a security team and 1520 followers Faqir and his entourage travel in the Bajaur region with impunity

However his house was burnt down by tribal elders as is custom He was warned in January 2006 that failure to surrender to authorities would result in his house being burnt down again

He is third in command of the Pakistani Taliban umbrella group TehrikiTaliban Pakistan TTP formed in December 2007 under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud and prefers the title Commander Faqir

On February 23 2009 Faqir Mohammed declared in a 30minute radio broadcast that his followers would begin a unilateral ceasefire The speech came only a few hours after the Pakistani military announced a halt to operations in the nearby Swat valley where it had been battling the Swati division of the TTP under the leadership of Maulana Fazlullah

After Baituallah Mehsuds reported death in August 2009 Maulana Faqir Mohammed announced to the BBC that he would assume temporary leadership of the TTP and that Muslim Khan would serve as primary spokesperson He also maintained that Baitullah had not been killed but rather was in ill health Faqir further elaborated that decisions over leadership of the umbrella group would only be made in consultation and consensus with other TTP leaders The congregation of Taliban leaders has 32 members and no important decision can be taken without their consultation he told the BBC He reported to the AFP that both Hakimullah Mehsud and WaliurRehman had approved his appointment as temporary leader of the militant group Neither militant had publicly confirmed Faqirs statement and analysts cited by Dawn News believed the assumption of leadership actually indicated a power struggle

Two days later Faqir Mohammed retracted his claims of temporary leadership and said that Hakimullah Mehsud had been selected leader of the TTP

After the alleged death of Hakimullah Mehsud in midJanuary 2010 Faqir Mohammed was one of the highest level leaders Malik Noor Jamal alias Maulana Toofan was reported to have been appointed as head of the TTP after Mehsuds death but his leadership may not have been entirely accepted as there were also reports of deadly clashes between Toofans men and those of a TTP leader in Kurram Pakistan launched an air attack on a building where it was thought that Faqir Mohammed was having a meeting with Taliban figures Fateh Mohammad and Qari Ziaur Rehman Fateh Mohammed was quickly confirmed as dead but the death of the other two was not known immediately Within days Faqir Mohammed gave a telephone interview and claimed that he was not present at the attack and that all senior officials had survived

Faqir Mohammed launched attacks on Pakistani border posts from Afghanistans eastern Kunar province across the border with Pakistans Bajaur Agency and was hosted by Qari ZiaurRahman Mohammed claimed responsibility for a 4 July 2011 attack on a paramilitary checkpoint and for similar attacks in June 2011 on several border villages in Bajaur During a radio broadcast Mohammed stated Our fighters carried out these two attacks from Afghanistan and we will launch more such attacks inside Afghanistan and in Pakistan

In early March 2012 the TTP announced that Faqir had been demoted from his role as naib amir and would be considered a common fighter The main TTP spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan reported that Faqir Mohammed had been conducting peace talks with the Pakistani government without the approval of TTP leadership

On 18 February 2013 Maulvi Faqir was arrested along with his four accomplices by Afghan Intelligence Officials while he was trying to enter Pakistans Tirah Valley from Afghanistans Nangarhar province

The Highrise of Pcs in Hungarian Pcsi Magashz was a highrise residential building of 84 meters height and 25 floors in Pcs Hungary It was built between 1974 and 1976 by Baranya County State Construction Industry Company Baranya Megyei llami ptipari Vllalat When it was inhabited it had 800 residences In 1989 however it was determined that the buildings inner structure was deteriorating to a dangerous extent The building was evacuated There have been some plans to renovate and use the building for various purposes but none of these were ever realized By 2003 the building had fallen into a critical condition so it was reinforced but it remained out of use It was the tallest outofuse building in Central Europe until its deconstruction in 2016

The reinforced concrete structure of Magashz was built using Yugoslavian IMS post tensioning technology

This technology was used to create residential and public buildings in Hungary since the early 1970s The idea behind IMS was constructing premade floor slabs and columns connecting them afterwards The gaps between elements were filled with a sealant called PU paste This filling material however was known to cause chloride corrosion over time damaging the beams and in Yugoslavia they used an inhibitor material and also separated the paste from the tensioned posts with a 1mm thin plastic sheet but in Hungary they skipped these despite only a very small amount of inhibitor wouldve been necessary Because of this the building became unstable and the inhabitants had to move out by the year 1989

In 2003 the local government paid 360 million Hungarian Forints for structural repairs The building was sold for an Austrian company the Porr Hungria Kft to make it a dormitory for the University of Pcs in the PPP program The company stepped back from the agreement in 2007

In the fall of 2007 the city made an unsuccessful tender to convert the building into an office for the local government Magashz was sold again in 2008 to the La Torre 2008 Kft that accumulated significant debt over the years since

No progress has been made in the utilization of the building until 2011 when the idea of selling Magashz to the company resund Holding incurred so that it would be demolished and a municipal building would be constructed in its place that would be rented by the city for 30 years

On 25 April 2013 the Second Cabinet of Viktor Orbn held a session in Pcs Here Viktor Orbn made a promise to mayor Zsolt Pva that the government will give one billion Hungarian forints for the demolition of Magashz if the city acquires the ownership of the building

On 4 October 2013 the La Torre 2008 Kft was acquired by a citizen of Pcs the 76 years old pensioner Hossz Zoltn Dnesn The court of KomromEsztergom ordered the liquidation of the company on 16 October

On 22 October 2013 the declaration of demolition for the building was issued giving a sixmonth deadline for the owner

Finally in March 2016 the demolishing started and the last walls of the building disappeared in October 2016

ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company
The ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company ran both passenger and automobile ferry service across the Chesapeake Bay from 1919 to 1952 The initial service was between Annapolis Maryland on the western shore and Claiborne Maryland on the eastern shore In July 1930 a second shorter route was added between Annapolis Maryland and Matapeake on Kent Island Maryland Business increased so rapidly at that point that another ferryboat was added In May 1938 the Claiborne route was changed to run from Claiborne to Romancoke Maryland on the lower end of Kent Island from which passengers could then connect to the Matapeake to Annapolis run In 1943 the Annapolis United States Naval Academy absorbed the property where the ferry terminal had been so service was switched from Annapolis to a new terminal at Sandy Point on the western shore By May 1951 the ferries were handling 1 million vehicles and 2 million passengers annually Ferry service stopped running in 1952 when the Chesapeake Bay Bridge was completed

The first ClaiborneAnnapolis run was June 19 1919 with the sidewheeler Gov Emerson C Harrington named for the 48th Governor of Maryland and later President of the ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company As governor Harrington had been instrumental in getting the ferry started In 1915 the State Roads Commission had appropriated 50000 to establish a stateowned ferry With the beginning of World War I planning was put on hold until 1919 At that time a group of businessmen headed by J P Mehaham of St Louis and Frank McNamee of Albany and at the urging of Gov Harrington formed a private company named the ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Inc The state funds were instead diverted toward subsidizing the new private company The Old Harrington as the boat became known made two round trips daily crossing the Chesapeake Bay in 1 hour 20 minutes

In 1921 the company was in bankruptcy but Gov Harrington his term as Governor over became President of the company and instituted reforms to make it more profitable Not until 1924 did the company begin to see receipts exceed expenses In 1921 a bus route was added to carry passengers to Easton Hurlock and Cambridge In 1928 the company was reorganized and renamed the ClaiborneAnnapolis Ferry Company

The Gov Emerson C Harrington was retired in 1937 and replaced by the Gov Harry W Nice a doubleender which could hold up to 68 cars Other boats were to include the General Lincoln Majestic Albert C Ritchie John M Dennis Gov Harry W Nice Gov Emerson C Harrington II Governor Herbert R OConor and the B Frank Sherman the last named for the companys General Manager from 19241952

Serious discussion about building a bridge across the Chesapeake Bay had been around since at least 1907 but did not take hold until the 1930s Since the bridge would put the ferry out of business the State decided it had an obligation to the ferry owners to purchase the company In 1941 the company was purchased for 1023000 by the Maryland State Roads Commission now the Maryland State Highway Administration and was renamed the Chesapeake Bay Ferry System

At the time the company was purchased by the State Roads Commission it had approximately 120 employees

Service on the ferry was continued across the Chesapeake Bay until July 30 1952 the same day the new Chesapeake Bay Bridge was opened During a final run by the John M Dennis a few weeks before the bridge opening it accidentally rammed the new bridge Variations on the cause of the accident can be found between newspaper accounts and recollections by family members of the ships Captain Edward C Higgins The last run from Claiborne to Romancoke was on December 31 1952 by the Gov Emerson C Harrington II

Karaganov is known as the progenitor of the Karaganov Doctrine which states that Moscow should pose as the defender of human rights of ethnic Russians living in the near abroad for the purpose of gaining political influence in these regions After Karaganov published an article advocating this stance in 1992 Russias foreign policy position linked Russian troop withdrawals from the Baltics with the end of systemic discrimination against Russians in these countries

In addition to his Doctrine Karaganov has advocated for a united SinoRussian strategy to unify a Eurasian bloc He argues that the Eurasian Economic Union EEU and Chinas One Belt One Road Initiative OBOR will work together to promote economic integration throughout the region Many experts disagree with this judgement claiming that China as a far more powerful economy will simply dominate this Eurasian bloc This would counter Russian ambitions to regain their foothold as a global power

Penalty shot
A penalty shot or kick is a play used in several sports whereby a goal is attempted during untimed play Depending on the sport when a player commits certain types of penalties the opposition is awarded a penalty shot or kick attempt The rules on how a player attempts a penalty shot or kick also varies between sports

Penalty shots or kicks are sometimes grouped into the larger penalty shootout which is used as a tiebreaker to decide games in several sports

In association football a penalty kick is awarded to the opponent when a direct free kick foul has been committed by a team within its own penalty area The shot is taken from the penalty mark which is from the goal line and centred between the touch line while the goal is defended only by the opposing teams goalkeeper If the match is tied after 90min of regulation and 30min of extra time a penalty shootout is used to determine the winner Penalties are taken from the spot but no rebounds are allowed

A penalty shot is awarded to the fouled team in bandy following a foul usually punishable by a freeshot but that has occurred within their opponents penalty area

The situations when a penalty shot is to be made is stated in Rule 14 of the Bandy Playing Rules published by the Federation of International Bandy The execution of a penalty shot is regulated in Rule 15

If a match is at a draw at full time a penalty shot competition can be arranged in order to determine a winning team either after an extension of the match which still is at a draw or instead of an extension This is regulated in Rule 16

In Gaelic football a penalty kick may be awarded if a defender commits a foul within the large rectangle enclosing the goal The penalty kick is taken from the ground from the centre of the 11m line Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals

In ice hockey a penalty shot is awarded to a player in a good shooting position denied a chance at a goal by the foul of an opponent All players are required to leave the ice rink as the player who got fouled faces off solely against the goaltender of the opposite team The puck is placed at the center of the ice rink as the player has twenty seconds to retrieve the puck and attempt to score a goal against the goaltender The penalty shot ends as soon as the puck either crosses the goal line is blocked by the goaltender stops moving moves in the opposite direction of the goal line or if the shooter loses possession of the puck

Penalty shots are awarded

If a side commits a penalty infringement the opposition can take the option of a place kick at goal from where the infringement occurred A successful penalty kick is worth two points in rugby league and three points in rugby union

A penalty shot or throw is awarded when a defender commits a major foul within the five meter area that prevents a likely goal

In field hockey a penalty stroke or a penalty corner is awarded after a foul

Free throws are the equivalent of the penalty shot in basketball free throws are much more common than penalty shots in other sports due to the much higher rate of scoring in that game

Gridiron football does not have any sort of explicit equivalent to the penalty shot scenarios where an illegal act deprived someone of a score are handled through the unfair act clause which allows officials the right to assess any penalty they see fit including awarding the score automatically

Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia
The Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia also known as the Genocide of the Serbs   Genocid nad Srbima included the extermination expulsion and forced religious conversion of hundreds of thousands ethnic Serbs by the genocidal policies of the Ustashe regime in the Independent State of Croatia NDH between 1941 and 1945 during World War II The Ustashe regime systematically murdered approximately 300000 to 500000 Serbs out of whom up to 52000 died at the Jasenovac concentration camp according to current estimates

Ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs can be traced back to the Great Schism of 1054 During the time of the Austrian Empire many Croats came to resent the privileges granted to Serbs living in the Military Frontier of the Habsburg Monarchy Following the collapse of AustriaHungary in the final days of World War I the Croat and Slovenedominated State of Slovenes Croats and Serbs was established Having fought on the side of the Central Powers during the war ethnic Croats and Slovenes  who formed the majority of the states population  were viewed unfavourably by western nations and as such they failed to gain recognition from the Great Powers This left them no choice but to join a union largely dominated by ethnic Serbs which came to be known as the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes Upon its creation the state was composed of six million Serbs 35 million Croats and 1 million Slovenes Being the largest ethnic group the Serbs favoured a centralized state whereas Croats Slovenes and Bosnian Muslims did not

Approved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian constitution of 1903 the socalled Vidovdan Constitution established the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes as a parliamentary monarchy under the Serbian Karaorevi dynasty Belgrade was chosen as the capital of the new state assuring Serb and Orthodox Christian political dominance In 1928 Croatian Peasant Party HSS leader Stjepan Radi was assassinated on the floor of the countrys parliament by a Montenegrin Serb leader and Peoples Radical Party NRS politician Punia Rai The following year King Alexander I proclaimed the 6 January Dictatorship and renamed his country the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to deemphasize its ethnic makeup Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called banovinas six of which had ethnic Serb majorities In 1931 the king issued a decree which allowed the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only proYugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it Marginalized farright and farleft movements thrived The Ustae a Croatian fascist party emerged as the most extreme movement of these The Ustae were driven by a deep hatred of Serbs and Serbdom and claimed that Croats and Serbs were separated by an unbridgable cultural gulf which prevented them from ever living alongside each other They organized the socalled Velebit uprising in 1932 assaulting a police station in the village of Bruani in Lika The police responded harshly to the assault and harassed the local population In 1934 the Ustae cooperated with Bulgarian Hungarian and Italian rightwing extremists to assassinate Alexander while he visited the French city of Marseille Alexanders cousin Prince Paul took the regency until Alexanders son Peter II turned eighteen Ustae leader Ante Paveli believed that the assassination would cause Yugoslavia to disintegrate Instead countries that had assisted the organization such as Italy and Hungary cracked down on its members arrested them and destroyed their training camps at Yugoslavias behest According to historian Slavko Goldstein the Ustae planned to commit a genocide against ethnic Serbs for years prior to the outbreak of World War II One of Pavelis main ideologues Mijo Babi wrote in 1932

Croatian opposition to a centralized Yugoslavia continued following Alexanders assassination culminating with the signing of the CvetkoviMaek Agreement by Croatian politician Vladko Maek and Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragia Cvetkovi on 26 August 1939 By signing the agreement Belgrade sought to accommodate moderate Croats through the creation of a largely autonomous Banovina of Croatia which covered 27 percent of Yugoslavias territory and included 29 percent of its population It also ensured that Maek became Yugoslavias deputy premier Ultimately the agreement was not successfulit led to other Yugoslav ethnic groups demanding a status similar to that of Croatia and failed to satisfy rightwing Croats such as those that had joined the Ustae who wanted a fully independent Croatian state The Ustae were enraged by the very notion of Maek having negotiated with Belgrade denouncing him as a sell out Rightwing Croats quickly orchestrated antiSerbian incidents across the newly formed Banovina and in June 1940 a Croatian NationalSocialist Party was established in Zagreb On 25 March 1941 Yugoslavia bowed to German pressure and signed the Tripartite Pact in an effort to avoid war with the Axis powers Two days later a group of Serbian nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers organized a coup dtat to depose Prince Paul and the government of Dragia Cvetkovi Peter was declared to be of age and was elevated to the throne Upon hearing news of the coup Adolf Hitler immediately ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia

In April 1941 the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis powers and the puppet state known as the Independent State of Croatia NDH was created ruled by the Ustae regime The ideology of the Ustae movement was a blend of Nazism Catholicism and Croatian ultranationalism The Ustae supported the creation of a Greater Croatia that would span to the Drina river and the outskirts of Belgrade The movement emphasized the need for a racially pure Croatia and promoted the extermination of Serbs who were viewed as ethinic foreigners Jews and Gypsies

A major ideological influence on the Croatian nationalism of the Ustae was the 19thcentury nationalist Ante Starevi Starevi was an advocate of Croatian unity and independence and was both antiHabsburg and antiSerb He envisioned the creation of a Greater Croatia that would include territories inhabited by Bosniaks Serbs and Slovenes considering Bosniaks and Serbs to be Croats who had been converted to Islam and Eastern Orthodox Christianity and considering the Slovenes to be mountain Croats

Starevi argued that the large Serb presence in the territories that were claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement which had been encouraged by the Habsburg rulers along with the influx of groups like Vlachs who took up Eastern Orthodox Christianity and identified themselves as Serbs The Ustae used Starevis theories to promote the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia and they recognized Croatia as having two major ethnocultural components Catholic Croats and Muslim Croats because the Ustae saw the Islam of the BosnianMuslims as a religion which keeps true the blood of Croats Armed struggle genocide and terrorism were glorified by the group Alexander Korb wrote

 
After Nazi forces entered into Zagreb on April 10 1941 Pavelis closest associate Slavko Kvaternik proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia NDH on a Radio Zagreb broadcast Meanwhile Paveli and several hundred Ustae volunteers left their camps in Italy and travelled to Zagreb where Paveli declared a new government on 16 April 1941 He accorded himself the title of Poglavnik   The Independent State of Croatia was declared to be on Croatian ethnic and historical territory

The NDH combined most of modern Croatia all of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern Serbia into an ItalianGerman quasiprotectorate NDH authorities led by the Ustae militia then implemented genocidal policies against the Serb Jewish and Romani populations living in the new state The Ustashe cruelty and sadism shocked even Nazi commanders

Viktor Guti made several speeches in early summer 1941 calling Serbs former enemies and unwanted elements to be cleansed and destroyed and also threatened Croats who did not support their cause

In 1941 the usage of the Cyrillic script was banned and in June 1941 began the elimination of Eastern Serbian words from the Croatian language as well as the shutting down of Serbian schools Ante Paveli ordered through the Croatian state office for language the creation of new words from old roots some which are used today and purged many Serbian words

In the summer of 1941 Ustashe militias and death squads burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian Serbs in the countryside in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools Men women children were hacked to death thrown alive into pits and down ravines or set on fire in churches Some Serb villages near Srebrenica and Ozren were wholly massacred while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between Vlasenica and Kladanj

A large number of massacres were committed by the Ustashe Some of the more notable ones were

The Ustashe set up temporary concentration camps in the spring of 1941 and laid the groundwork for a network of permanent camps in autumn The creation of concentration camps and extermination campaign of Serbs had been planned by the Ustashe leadership long before 1941 In Ustashe state exhibits in Zagreb the camps were portrayed as productive and peaceful work camps with photographs of smiling inmates Croatia was the only Axis satellite to have erected camps specifically for children

Serbs Jews and Romani were arrested and sent to concentration camps such as Jasenovac Stara Gradika Gospi and Jadovno There were 2226 camps in NDH in total Special camps for children were those at Sisak Gornja Rijeka and Jastrebarsko while Stara Gradika held thousands of children and women

The largest and most notorious camp was the JasenovacStara Gradika complex the largest extermination camp in the Balkans An estimated 100000 inmates perished there most Serbs Vjekoslav Maks Luburi the commanderinchief of all the Croatian camps announced the great efficiency of the Jasenovac camp at a ceremony on 9 October 1942 and also boasted We have slaughtered here at Jasenovac more people than the Ottoman Empire was able to do during its occupation of Europe
Bounded by rivers and two barbedwire fences making escape unlikely the Jasenovac camp was divided into five camps the first two closed in December 1941 while the rest were active until the end of the war Stara Gradika Jasenovac V held women and children The Ciglana brickyards Jasenovac III camp the main killing ground and essentially a death camp had 88 mortality rate higher than Auschwitzs 846 A former brickyard a furnace was engineered into a crematorium with witness testimony of some including children being burnt alive and stench of human flesh spreading in the camp Luburi had a gas chamber built at Jasenovac V where a considerable number of inmates were killed during a threemonth experiment with sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B but this method was abandoned due to poor construction Still that method was unnecessary as most inmates perished from starvation disease especially typhus assaults with mallets maces axes poison and knives The srbosjek Serbcutter was a glove with an attached curved blade designed to cut throats Large groups of people were regularly executed upon arrival outside camps and thrown into the river Unlike Germanrun camps Jasenovac specialized in brutal oneonone violence such as guards attacking barracks with weapons and throwing the bodies in the trenches The infamous camp commander Filipovi dubbed fra Sotona brother Satan and the personification of evil on one occasion drowned Serb women and children by flooding a cellar Filipovi and other camp commanders such as Dinko aki and his wife  the sister of Maks Luburi used ingenious torture There were throatcutting contests of Serbs in which prison guards made bets among themselves as to who could slaughter the most inmates It was reported that guard and former Franciscan priest Petar Brzica won a contest on 29 August 1942 after cutting the throats of 1360 inmates Inmates were tied and hit over the head with mallets and halfalive hung in groups by the Granik ramp crane their intestines and necks slashed then dropped into the river When the Partisans and Allies closed in at the end of the war the Ustashe began mass liquidations at Jasenovac marching women and children to death and shooting most of the remaining male inmates then torched buildings and documents before fleeing

The Ustashe viewed religion and nationality as closely linked while Roman Catholicism and Islam Bosnian Muslims were viewed as Croats were recognized as Croatian national religions Eastern Orthodoxy was deemed inherently incompatible with the Croatian state project They saw Orthodoxy as hostile because it was identified as Serb On 3 May 1941 a law was passed on religious conversions pressuring Serbs to convert to Catholicism and thereby adopt Croat identity This was made on the eve of Pavelis meeting with Pope Pious XII in Rome The Catholic Church in Croatia headed by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac greeted it and adopted it into the Church internal law The term Serbian Orthodox was banned in midMay as uncompatible with state order and substituted it with GreekEastern faith By the end of September 1941 about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy 335 priests had been expelled

Ustashe propaganda legitimized persecution partly based on historical CatholicOrthodox struggle for domination in Europe and Catholic intolerance towards the schismatics Following Serb insurgency provoked by Ustashe terror killing and deportation campaign the State Directorate for Regeneration launched a program in the autumn of 1941 aimed at mass forced conversion of Serbs Already in the summer the Ustashe had closed or destroyed most of the Serbian Orthodox churches and monasteries and deported imprisoned or murdered Orthodox priests and bishops The conversions were meant to Croatianize and permanently destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church The Vatican was not opposed to the forced conversions On 6 February 1942 Pope Pious XII privately received 206 Ustashes in uniforms and blessed them giving symbolical support to their acts On 8 February 1942 envoy to the Holy See Rusinovi said that the Holy See joyed over forced conversions Cardinal Luigi Maglione the Holy See secretary encouraged the Croatian bishops in a 21 February 1942 letter to speed up the conversions and also stressed that the Orthodox term be replaced with terms apostates or schismatics Many fanatic Catholic priests joined the Ustashe blessed and supported their work and participated in killings and conversions

In 194142 some 200000 or 240000250000 Serbs were converted to Roman Catholicism although most temporarily Converts would sometimes be killed anyway often in the same churches they were rebaptized 85 of the Serbian Orthodox clergy was killed or expelled In Lika Kordun and Banija alone 172 Serbian Orthodox churches were closed destroyed or plundered On 2 July 1942 the Croatian Orthodox Church was founded in order to replace the institutions of the Serbian Orthodox Church after the matter of forced conversion had become extremely controversial

Many Catholic bishops and priests in Croatia openly supported the Ustashe actions and also there were no condemnations of the crimes public or private by the Catholic hierarchy The Croatian Catholic Church and Vatican in fact viewed policies against Serbs as advantegous to Roman Catholicism Nevertheless historian Tomasevich praised some of the public statements and deeds made by archbishop Aloysius Stepinac but noted that there were shortcomings in statements and actions regarding genocidal actions against the Serbs and the Serbian Orthodox Church In his diary Stepinac said that Serbs and Croats are of two different worlds north and south pole which will never unite as long as one of them is alive along with other similar views Croatias rehabilitation of Stepinac in 2016 met negative reaction in Serbia and Republika Srpska

An estimated 120000 Serbs were deported from NDH to Germanoccupied Serbia and 300000 fled by 1943 The general plan was to have prominent people deported first so their property could be nationalized and the remaining Serbs could then be more easily manipulated By the end of September 1941 about half of the Serbian Orthodox clergy 335 priests had been expelled

During the war and during Titos Yugoslavia various numbers were given for overall war casualties Estimations by Holocaust memorial centers also vary As concluded by historian Rory Yeomans the most conservative estimates put the lower number of 300000 and possibly as many as 500000 Serbs killed by Ustashe death squads executed or perished at concentration camps Tomasevich said that the exact number of victims in Yugoslavia is impossible to determine Sabrina P Ramet estimated at least 300000 Serbs massacred by the Ustae Demographer Bogoljub Koovi author of the most serious study of World War II victims in Yugoslavia estimated 370410000 Serbs who died in NDH The number of victims at the Jasenovac concentration camp remains a matter of debate but current estimates put the number at around 100000 about half of which were Serbs

In Serbia and in the eyes of Serbs the Ustashe atrocities constituted a genocide Some Western and Jewish authors acknowledge it as a genocide or if not calling it explicitly genocide call Ustashe policies and acts genocidal R Lemkin also called Hungarian and Bulgarian policies against Serbs genocidal

Catholic extremism was at the heart of Ustae policy and this meant that many Serbs in the NDH were given the option of either converting to Catholicism or face deportation to a concentration camp Serbs who refused to renounce the Orthodox Christian faith ultimately faced death in concentration camps across the NDH especially at Jasenovac concentration camp In the postwar era the Serbian Orthodox Church considered that the Serbian victims of this genocide were martys As a result the Serbian Orthodox Church celebrates Holy New Martys of Jasenovac Concentration Camp on September 13

After World War II most of the remaining Ustashe went underground or fled to countries such as Australia Canada the United States and Germany with the assistance of Roman Catholic clerics and grassroots supporters

The Yugoslav communist government did not use the Jasenovac camp as was done with other European concentration camps most likely due to SerbCroat relations Titos government attempted to let the wounds heal and forge brotherhood and unity in the peoples Tito himself was invited to and passed Jasenovac several times but never visited the site

With the Partisan liberation of Yugoslavia many Ustashe leaders fled and took refuge at the college of San Girolamo degli Illirici near the Vatican Catholic priest and Ustashe Krunoslav Draganovi directed the fugitives from San Girolamo The US State Department and CounterIntelligence Corps helped war criminals to escape and assisted Draganovi who later worked for the American intelligence in sending Ustashe abroad Many of those responsible for mass killings in NDH took refuge in South America Portugal Spain and the United States Luburi was assassinated in Spain in 1969 by an UDBA agent Artukovi lived in Ireland and California until extradited in 1986 and died of natural causes in prison Dinko aki and his wife Nada lived in Argentina until extradited in 1998 Dinko dying in prison and his wife released Draganovi also arranged Gestapo functionary Klaus Barbies flight

In the Croat diaspora the Ustashe became heroes Ustashe migr terrorist groups in the diaspora such as Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood and Croatian National Resistance carried out assassinations and bombings and also plane hijackings throughout the Yugoslav period


Some Croats including politicians have attempted to minimise the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against Serbs in the World War II puppet state of Germany the Independent State of Croatia

By 1989 the future President of Croatia Franjo Tuman who had been a Partisan during World War II had embraced Croatian nationalism and published  in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the Ustae during the Second World War In his book Tuman claimed that fewer than thirtythousand people died at Jasenovac Tuman also estimated that a total of 900000 Jews had perished in the Holocaust Tumans views and his governments toleration of Ustaa symbols frequently strained relations with Israel Nonetheless in his book he did confirm that genocide happened

An example of ultranationalist antiSerb sentiment in contemporary Croatian public life is Thompson a Croatian rock band that has been protested against on numerous occasions for having sung Ustae songs most notably Jasenovac i Gradika Stara People publicly displaying Ustae affiliation at Thompson concerts in Croatia and elsewhere is a frequent occurrence leading to complaints from the Simon Wiesenthal Center

In 2006 a video was leaked showing Croatian President Stipe Mesi giving a speech in Australia in the early 1990s in which he said that the Croats had won a great victory on April 10th the date of the formation of the Independent State of Croatia in 1941 and that Croatia needed to apologize to no one for Jasenovac Later on Mesi apologized for his indecent statement and stated that he undoubtedly considered antifascism to be the basis of modernday Croatia appreciated Yugoslav Partisans and considered it necessary to reaffirm antifascism as a human and civilization commitment in the function of the unavoidable condition for the building of a democratic Croatia a country of equal citizens

On 17 April 2011 in a commemoration ceremony Croatian President Ivo Josipovi warned that there were attempts to drastically reduce or decrease the number of Jasenovac victims adding faced with the devastating truth here that certain members of the Croatian people were capable of committing the cruelest of crimes I want to say that all of us are responsible for the things that we do At the same ceremony then Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor said there is no excuse for the crimes and therefore the Croatian government decisively rejects and condemns every attempt at historical revisionism and rehabilitation of the fascist ideology every form of totalitarianism extremism and radicalism Pavelis regime was a regime of evil hatred and intolerance in which people were abused and killed because of their race religion nationality their political beliefs and because they were the others and were different

In 2008 in Melbourne Australia a Croat restaurant held a celebration to honour Ustae leader Ante Paveli The event was an outrageous affront both to his victims and to any persons of morality and conscience who oppose racism and genocide Dr Efraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center stated According to local press reports a large photograph of Paveli was hung in the restaurant Tshirts with his picture and that of two other commanders in the 194145 Ustae government were offered for sale at the bar and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia was celebrated Zuroff noted this was not the first time that Croatian migrs in Australia had openly defended Croat Nazi war criminals 
It is high time that the authorities in Australia find a way to take the necessary measures to stop such celebrations which clearly constitute racist ethnic and antiSemitic incitement against Serbs Jews and Gypsies

The Ustae had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during World War II into Swiss bank accounts Of a total of 350 million Swiss Francs about 150 million was seized by British troops however the remaining 200 million ca 47 million dollars reached the Vatican In October 1946 the American intelligence agency SSU alleged that these funds are still held in the Vatican Bank This matter is the crux of a recent class action suit against the Vatican Bank and other defendants

World War II and especially its ethnic conflicts have been deemed instrumental in the later Yugoslav Wars 199195

Israeli President Moshe Katsav visited Jasenovac in 2003 His successor Shimon Peres paid homage to the camps victims when he visited Jasenovac on 25 July 2010 and laid a wreath at the memorial Peres dubbed the Ustaes crimes to be a demonstration of sheer sadism

The Jasenovac Memorial Museum reopened in November 2006 with a new exhibition designed by a Croatian architect Helena Paver Njiri and an Educational Center designed by the firm Produkcija The Memorial Museum features an interior of rubberclad steel modules video and projection screens and glass cases displaying artifacts from the camp Above the exhibition space which is quite dark is a field of glass panels inscribed with the names of the victims

The New York City Parks Department the Holocaust Park Committee and the Jasenovac Research Institute with the help of thenCongressman Anthony Weiner DNY established a public monument to the victims of Jasenovac in April 2005 the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of the camps The dedication ceremony was attended by ten Yugoslavian Holocaust survivors as well as diplomats from Serbia Bosnia and Israel It remains the only public monument to Jasenovac victims outside the Balkans

To commemorate the victims of the Kragujevac massacre the whole of umarice where the killings took place was turned into a memorial park There are several monuments there the monument to the murdered schoolchildren and their teachers the Broken Wing monument the monument of pain and defiance and the monument One Hundred for One the monument of resistance and freedom Serbian poet Desanka Maksimovi wrote a poem about the massacre titled Krvava Bajka A Bloody Fairy Tale

Paolo Giordano I Orsini
Paolo Giordano Orsini 1541  13 November 1585 was an Italian nobleman and the first duke of Bracciano from 1560 He was a member of the Roman family of the Orsini

The son of Girolamo Orsini and Francesca Sforza he was grandson on his fathers side of Felice della Rovere illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II and Gian Giordano Orsini and on his mothers side of Count Bosio Sforza and Costanza Farnese an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III

On 3 September 1558 he married Isabella de Medici daughter of Cosimo I de Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany at Poggio a Caiano Paolo Giordano lived mostly in Rome and his castle at Bracciano rather than with his wife who stayed mostly at Florence In 1571 he took part to the battle of Lepanto A year later in October 1572 he served as a general of the Spanish infantry in a campaign that tried to reclaim the garrison of Navarino in the Peloponnese

On 16 July 1576 his wife died unexpectedly at the Medici villa of Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday According to her brother the grand duke Francesco I de Medici this occurred while she was washing her hair in the morning  She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees having immediately fallen dead This official version of events was not generally believed and the Ferrarese ambassador Ercole Cortile obtained information that Isabella was strangled at midday by her husband in the presence of several named servants

Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family her cousin Leonora having died of a similar accident only a few days before Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed his wife in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with his cousin Troilo Orsini or that he acted on instructions of Isabellas brother the grandduke One scholar Elisabetta Mori has argued that Isabella de Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici

After these events Paolo Giordano returned to Rome where he started a relationship with Vittoria Accoramboni wife of Francesco Peretti the nephew of the future Pope Sixtus V Peretti was assassinated it was believed by Paolo Giordanos order in April 1581 Wanted by both the Papal and Florentine police Paolo Giordano took refuge in northern Italy first in Venice and then in Abano and Sal with his mistress whom he married on 20 April 1585 He died at Sal on 13 November 1585

On 22 December Vittoria was herself assassinated by Ludovico Orsini of the Monterotondo line on the instigation of Grand Duke Francesco The Medici Francesco and Cardinal Ferdinando wished to secure movable assets in possession of Vittoria for their nephew Virginio Orsini Paolo Giordanos son from his first marriage and principal heir

Ned Raggett of Allmusic wrote of their influences rather than simply cloning Depeche Modes own style in the fashion of bands like Camouflage the integration of that approach with God Lives Underwaters own murky rock is even better than before Marc Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly wrote Whether this is a Weenlike exercise in genre parody or an earnest effort is debatable but either way its good weird fun Annie Marie Cruz of CMJ New Music Monthly called it a tolerable album filled with nothing you havent heard before Chuck Eddy of Spin wrote that the album uses less guitars than their previous releases and recommended it to fans of OK Computer though he found it too lacking in aggression

Serasker
Serasker or seraskier   is a title formerly used in the Ottoman Empire for a vizier who commanded an army

Following the suppression of the Janissaries in 1826 Sultan Mahmud II transferred the functions of the old Agha of the Janissaries to the serasker The latter now became a distinct office at the head of the Ottoman military combining the functions of a commanderinchief and a minister of war He also took over the Janissary Aghas former duties regarding the upkeep of order in Istanbul Indeed as the police system developed and expanded with the empires progressive centralization it became one of the main duties of the serasker until 1845 when it became a separate agency

The seat of the serasker and his department babi seraskeri or serasker kapsGate of the serasker initially was in the Eski Saray but were transferred to dedicated buildings in 1865 In 1879 the office was renamed to Ministry of War Harbiye Nezareti until 1890 when it reverted to its old name it was finally renamed again to Ministry of War in 1908

To Kill the ChildLeaving Beirut
To Kill the ChildLeaving Beirut is a 2004 digital download and a Japanonly CD single written and performed by Roger Waters

The first song of the single runs at 3 minutes and 31 seconds The lyrics open with the image of a child sleeping in the glow of a Donald Duck light a reference to Waters prior song The Tide Is Turning Waters goes on to ask why a culture whose primary concerns are luxury consumption and petty values would kill the child The song ends with a plea to protect children from the crusadewaging bigots and bully boys  Slugging it out in the yard

The second track of the single runs at 12 minutes and 29 seconds Most of the songs lyrics are derived from a short story about Waters hitchhiking excursion in Lebanon when he was a teenager These passages intoned in monologue over a descending synthesizer ostinato are interspersed with more recently penned refrains outlining Waters reaction to United States and United Kingdom involvement in the Iraq War Waters performed the song at every show on his The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour replacing the spokenword recitation with a visual backdrop of the story as a graphic novel

Waters condemnation of George W Bush at one point the songs lyrics claim that Texas education must have fucked him up received negative reactions from audience members during his show at New Jerseys PNC Bank Arts Center on 6 September 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City on 12 September 2006 and in Tampa Florida on 19 May 2007 however audience reactions during the 5 October 2006 performance at the Hollywood Bowl were overwhelmingly positive with many patrons rising to their feet and cheering The song also received a positive reaction during its American performances at the Boston Massachusetts and Camden New Jersey Tweeter Centers in New York on 30 May 2007 as well as in other cities worldwide particularly Mumbai and Dubai Ironically during his first show in Dallas Texas on 2 May 2008 the line referring to George Bush and the Texas education was met with uproarious applause His last show on the American leg of the tour in Houston on the 4th was met with a fairly mixed reaction

While many fans have embraced the songs lyrical content which is sympathetic towards the people of Lebanon some have objected to Waters political stance In 2006 Waters performed a concert in Neve Shalom Israel in front of a crowd of 50000 During the concert which included Leaving Beirut in the setlist Waters expressed his belief that Israel had to tear down the walls of the Israeli West Bank barrier pictured in the singles cover art to make peace with its neighbours The morning after Waters concert in Neve Shalom editorial writer Ben Dror Yemini wrote in the Israel newspaper Maariv

The song has also received some criticism for its musical content and style one review of the 10 October show at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View California claimed that the song floundered musically despite being lyrically one of Waters best postFloyd works

John Plessington
John Plessington c 1637  19 July 1679 also known as John Plesington William Scarisbrick and William Pleasington was an English Catholic priest who was executed by the English Crown for violating the ban on the presence of Catholic priests in the kingdom He is now honored as one of the Roman Catholic Forty Martyrs of England and Wales

He was born at Dimples Hall Garstang Lancashire the son of Robert Plessington a Royalist Roman Catholic and Alice Rawstone a family thus persecuted for both their religious and political beliefs He was educated by the Jesuits at Scarisbrick Hall then at the Royal College of Saint Alban at Valladolid Spain and then at Saint Omer Seminary in France He was ordained in Segovia Spain on 25 March 1662 He returned to England in 1663 ministering to covert Catholics in the areas of Holywell and Cheshire often hiding under the name John Scarisbrick He was also tutor at Puddington Old Hall near Chester Upon arrest in Chester during the Popish Plot scare caused by Titus Oates he was imprisoned for two months and then hanged drawn and quartered for the crime of being a Catholic priest From the scaffold at Gallows Hill in Boughton Cheshire he spoke the following
Plessington was beatified in 1929 by Pope Pius XI and canonized and made one of the Forty Martyrs on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI
There is now a school called St John Plessington in England which won TES School of the Year 2010 out of England Wales Ireland and Scotland

There is a memorial tablet to him located in the entrance porch of St Werburghs Catholic Church Grosvenor Park Road Chester just a short distance from the spot he was executed on In 1980 his name was added to the base of the granite obelisk nearby that was erected in 1898 for the Protestant martyr George Marsh in Boughton which has the following inscription

In the early 21st century a set of human bones found in an old trunk in Wales came to be regarded as possibly being Plessingtons remains They had been found in the late 19th century wrapped in 17thcentury clothing in a pub in Holywell Flintshire which had been known to be a secret gathering place for the Catholics of the region to worship covertly This had been the region where he had carried out his ministry before his arrest Showing signs of violence the bones had been considered those of some anonymous martyrs of the period and entrusted to a community of the Society of Jesus in nearby Tremeirchion

When a grave believed to have been Plessingtons was opened in 1962 as part of the process for his beatification it was found to contain the remains of a younger man Interest later focused on this set of remains In 2015 Mark Davies Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury started a campaign to raise the funds for the testing of the DNA of the bones

Zoya Akhtar said in an interview that she wrote the first draft seven years ago while relaxing on Palolem beach in Goa In an interview she said
I hand wrote it and it was some ridiculous epiclength when I came back and transcribed it on my laptop The first film is the easiest to write because its usually what the person knows their personal graphs milieu and feelings Luck By Chance is not about established actors but those who are waiting for things to happen Farhans character is fresh off the boat while Konkanas does bit roles looking for a big break

The production team went through a host of names like Madhuri Dixit Saif Ali Khan Karisma Kapoor Kajol Devgn and Tabu Having seen a lot of struggling actors come to Mumbai to make a living out of Bollywood Zoya found it was easy to write the script for the film without any research She was inspired to write this movie by a lot of Bollywoodinspired movies like Guddi Rangeela and Om Shanti Om

Javed Akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film incorporating as Zoya puts it his bizarre sense of humour Farhan had to reportedly train to get six pack abs for the film He was trained by Cheetah Yagnesh who appeared on the film as Farhans characters trainer

Filming faced a lot of problems including the unpredictable Mumbai rains which halted a song shoot with Hrithik Roshan The rains washed out the entire set and eventually the entire tent began to leak Zoya was afraid that this would lead to shortcircuit and so all the lights had to be switched off

According to Farhan principal photography for the film was completed in October

Zoya Akhtar cast her brother Farhan to play the lead role after it was suggested to her by director Reema Kagti She became convinced after seeing Farhans performance in The Fakir of Venice She said in an interview Farhan was the perfect choice for the role in Luck By Chance because he knows the industry in and out He is smart and bright and both of us have been working together for years Problems arose with the huge casting of the film Zoya said I had to really think it out when I was deciding on these multiple actors that I wanted in the film It was tough to decide especially because I wanted the right actors who could play themselves and still look believable as part of the film Then there are other good actors like Boman Irani and Saurabh Shukla who are playing characters in the film Next to be cast were her parents Javed Akhtar and Shabana Azmi along with such veteran stars as Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia Zoya said We could have had Shabana Azmi as the diva but I needed a mainstream heroine Only a leading lady would do Dimple has played it edgy Shes all warm soft sunshine and then theres a flip and shes hard cold steely Isha Sharvani teams up again with Hrithik Roshan after appearing together in an ad Juhi Chawla joined the cast playing Minty the wife of producer Rommy Rolly

The producers decided to go with subtle promotion letting audiences explore the film by themselves The main trailer for the movie was released in the last week of December It introduced the main characters and set the pace for what the plot was about BigFlix a part of Reliance BIG Entertainment Ltd was given the task of promoting the movie The first bit of promotion came from the music wherein winners were given signed albums by Farhan Akhtar and Konkona Sen Sharma They promoted the whole movie across the nation in all 112 stores in 10 cities as well to the international audiences through its videoondemand VOD site The prerelease promotional activities included online marketing and publicity of the films music videos trailers downloads previews preview shows contests and continued with other promotional activities postrelease like meetandgreet events with the star cast at select cities

A unique promotional campaign was launched by producers Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani called Auto By Chance They introduced 10 Auto by Chance threewheelers in suburban Mumbai suburbs that would transport people for free to the destination of their choice in the suburbs The promotion was run in conjunction with Big FM radio station and Godrej One passenger would be interviewed live by an RJ and go on air with his experience of getting lucky and enjoying the free ride The Indian gaming portal Zapakcom created a microsite for the movie with a game Luck by Chance  Lucky Break

The movie was initially scheduled to be released 23 January 2009 alongside Raaz  The Mystery Continues but was pushed to 30 January Luck by Chance was released on 900 screens worldwide in 27 countries Of this over 700 screens were in India and the rest were in overseas markets such as the United States Canada UK UAE Australia South Africa and New Zealand

The film was well received by critics Anupama Chopra of NDTV wrote Zoya pokes fun at Bollywood but she does it with a great affection There are some lovely little moments like the star daughter in a super short skintight outfit struggling to touch her producers feet without splitting a seam But what makes Luck By Chance compelling is the layers beneath the laughs Though the first half wobbles precariously as the script struggles to find a momentum but thankfully the narrative flows better in the latter half and culminates in a satisfying bittersweet end In the review at UAE Daily the United Arab Emirates reviewer said One of the prime reasons why Luck By Chance works is because of the writingRight from the characters to the individualistic scenes to the way Zoya puts them in a sequence Luck By Chance is easily one of the most cohesive scripts this side of the Atlantic If Zoyas writing is superb her execution of the written material deserves distinction marks The Times of India said Luck By Chance highlights how the film industry give regards to everything else but the story when making a movie and ironically weaves a fascinating story using that paradox Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOLin cited some drawbacks and said Luck By Chance provides you some smiles throughout the movie However it fails to leave you with the content smile that a feelgood movie ideally aims to do

The movie achieved 71 percent positive rating by seven critics on the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said It might seem as if Bollywood couldnt possibly satirize itself  the genre is already so overthetop  but Zoya Akhtar manages the trick deftly in Luck by ChanceA fabulous circustheme musical number pulls out all the stops but a scene in which an acting teacher explains why Hindi stars have to be more talented than those in Hollywood is a subtle comic gemIt is Mr Akhtar whose understated performance holds together this farranging cameofilled film He manages to remain sympathetic even while wreaking romantic havoc Frank Lovece of Film Journal International characterized it as The Player meets All About Eve in this seriocomic satire of the Bollywood film industry by a firsttime director whose collaring of over a dozen major Hindi stars for cameos speaks well of its biting accuracy while Kyle Smith of the New York Post found it gently humorous and almost totally lacking in the cynicism selfhatred and ennui that characterizes insideHollywood flicks

The movie had a slow start at the box office and registered 25 to 30 attendance According to trade analyst and critic Joginder Tuteja the occupancy at the theatres came down to 50 Outside India the movie failed to perform per expectations

In the US Luck by Chance debuted at number 32 In its opening weekend it collected 217439 approximately Rs 106 crores on 61 screens a perscreen average of 3556 In the UK Luck By Chance debuted at number 21 and collected 73822 approximately Rs 5095 lacs on 50 screens with a perscreen average of 1476 The movie did poorly in Australia and was a flop in India grossing 3914500 at the box office Worldwide the film grossed 4504365

Isabella de Medici
Isabella Romola de Medici 31 August 1542  16 July 1576 was the daughter of Cosimo I de Medici first Grand Duke of Tuscany and Eleonora di Toledo She was raised and educated in a humanist manner with her siblings including Francesco de Medici who succeeded their father as the Grand Duke of Tuscany To secure a relationship with the powerful Roman Orsinis Isabellas father arranged her marriage to Paolo Giordano I Orsini when she was 16 She remained in her fathers household after her marriage giving her an unusual degree of independence for a woman of her period Following the death of her father Isabella was probably murdered with the complicity of her husband and brother and in retribution for her relationship with Paolo Giordanos cousin Troilo Orsini

Isabella was born in Florence where with her brothers and sisters she lived first in the Palazzo Vecchio and later in the Palazzo Pitti spending much of her time as a child at fathers ancestral country home Villa di Castello The Medici children were educated at home by tutors in a range of subjects such as classics languages and arts From an early age Isabella showed a great love for music which in her adulthood she used as means for selfexpression according to biographer Caroline Murphy A great beauty she had a lively highspirited and impulsive character that was commented on by courtiers

In 1553 at age 11 Isabella was betrothed to 12yearold Paolo Giordano Orsini in line for the Duchy of Bracciano in southern Tuscany a liaison Isabellas father felt necessary to secure his southern border and his relationship the ancient Roman Orsini family The two married in 1558 in a semiprivate ceremony at Villa di Castello Paolo left the following day Concerned by the spending habits of his new soninlaw Cosimo decided to keep his daughter and her 50000 scudi dowry in Florence giving her greater freedom and control over her own affairs than was customary for Florentine women of the time 

Following her mothers death she acted as first lady of Florence for a time displaying the de Medici aptitude for politics She suffered several miscarriages and remained childless until her late twenties Her daughter Francesca Eleonora known as Nora was born in 1571 and eventually married her cousin Alessandro Sforza Her son Virginio was born in 1572 and eventually inherited his fathers dukedom 

Isabellas freespirited personality created rumours with regard to the nature of her relationship with Troilo Orsini Paolo Giordanos cousin who was charged with looking after her while her husband tended to military duties 

On 16 July 1576 Isabella died unexpectedly at the Medici villa in Cerreto Guidi during a hunting holiday According to her brother the grandduke this occurred while she was washing her hair in the morning  She was found by Signor Paolo Giordano on her knees having immediately fallen dead However the official version of events was not generally believed and the Ferrarese ambassador Ercole Cortile obtained information that Isabella was strangled at midday by her husband in the presence of several named servants Isabella was the second sudden death in an isolated country villa in the Medici family her cousin Leonora having died of a similar accident only a few days before Most historians assume that Paolo Giordano killed Isabella in reprisal for carrying on a love affair with Troilo Orsini or that he acted on instructions of the Grandduke Francesco Isabellas brother One scholar Elisabetta Mori has argued that Isabella de Medici died of natural causes and that the rumour that Paolo Giordano murdered her was spread by enemies of the Medici

Ned Brown Forest Preserve
The Ned Brown Forest Preserve popularly known as Busse Woods adjoining Elk Grove Village and Schaumburg in Illinois is a unit of the Cook County Forest Preserve system It is named after Edward Ned Eagle Brown A section of the northeast quadrant of the forest preserve is the Busse Forest Nature Preserve which was registered as a National Natural Landmark in February 1980 Busse Forest Preserve Busse Woods was named for Cook County Commissioner William Busse in 1949

Busse Woods the heart of the forest preserve is a mature Great Lakes hardwood forest A segment of the woods the Busse Forest Nature Preserve is listed as a national natural landmark as a surviving fragment of flatwoods a type of dampground forest formerly typical of extremely level patches of ground in the Great Lakes region Parcels of land with slow rates of precipitation runoff into adjacent wetlands and streams were likely to develop into flatwoods A flatwoods forest is characterized by red maple swamp white oak and black ash trees The black ash trees of Busse Woods are threatened by the emerald ash borer which was reported in Illinois for the first time in 2006

Other parts of Busse Woods are betterdrained and include species more typical of the forests of northern Illinois such as the basswood hickory sugar maple and white oak the latter species being the state tree of Illinois

There are of paved bicycle trail the Busse Woods Trail through the forest preserve a loop and two spurs providing pedestrian and bicycle access to the preserve In contrast to the natural area the northwest and southwest quadrants of the preserve are dominated by Busse Lake a artificial reservoir that serves as a floodcontrol catchment for Salt Creek and by the tall skyscrapers of eastern Schaumburg

The Friends of Busse Woods a nongovernmental organization began operations in 2008 It cooperates with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County to oversee stewardship partnering operations at Busse Woods Partnership operations include invasive species management trash removal and native plant reseeding and restocking The operations are carried out by volunteer stewards

Orion abort modes
NASAs Orion multipurpose crew vehicle MPCV was planned as the first American spacecraft since Project Apollo to use an escape system in the event of a launch abort something its predecessor the Space Shuttle had for only its first four orbital test flights in 19811982 Like the Apollo command and service module CSM the Orion CEV would use the launch escape system LES a solidfueled tractor rocket that would be able to pull the Orion crew module away from a malfunctioning Space Launch System SLS rocket during the initial launch phase Based on the launch escape system found on the SovietRussian Soyuz spacecraft the LAS designed and manufactured by ATK for the Orion CEV would be larger than the Soyuz version and will have more thrust than the Atlas 109D booster that carried astronaut John Glenn into orbit in 1962

The earlier Apollo system had various abort modes depending on altitude velocity and other circumstances Likewise the Orion will have similar modes of operation for its launch performance aborts Some of these may not use the LAS itself but would use the second stage of the Ares I or even the Orion vehicles own propulsion system the Aerojet AJ10 engine instead

Initially designed to land on solid ground like that of the early and current Soviet and Russian manned spacecraft Vostok Voskhod and Soyuz with a water landing as a backup in August 2007 NASA tentatively redesigned the Orion for water landings splashdowns as the primary mode of landing with ground landings as the emergency backup  Under the advice of the Exploration Systems Architecture Study ESAS report NASA will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on Apollo but with some procedures carried over from the Shuttle

The method of abort either using the LAS or the second stage of the Space Launch System booster depends on how far into the flight the spacecraft and crew are traveling

NASA has acquired several MRAPs to station near the launch pad should there be time for the crew to evacuate the vehicle One will be occupied by emergency rescue personnel while the other will stand empty behind a blast shelter Pad emergency egress enables astronauts and engineers to quickly escape the perimeter of the rocket Both ziplines and roller coasters were at one time studied for this purpose

During the first 120 seconds of flight up to the jettisoning of the solidfueled boosters at  the Orion crew module CM will separate from the rest of the rocket propelled by the LAS Unlike the Apollo Launch Escape System which used a pair of canards and the weight of the spacecraft to flip the vehicle over for landing the Orion LAS has a set of steering rockets that will steer the spacecraft away from the malfunctioning SLS as well as prepare the spacecraft for both separation and splashdown The tower will then be jettisoned 14 seconds later and the hypergolic fuel on the Orion CM would be automatically released at a predetermined altitude

After the LAS is jettisoned the Orion crew and service modules CSM will separate as a whole from the SLS and either use its large AJ10 engine or smaller control engines to maneuver from the rocket Similar to a Space Shuttle transAtlantic TAL abort profile the Orion will use the AJ10 engine to propel the spacecraft to a desired separation point in which then the Orion CM would land in either western Spain or Morocco on due east ie lunar flights or in Ireland or the United Kingdom on ISSbound flights A splashdown in the eastern Atlantic Ocean would only be a contingency

The SLS would propel the Orion CSM into an initial orbit upon which the spacecraft will immediately separate and then perform a retrofire that will allow the Orion CM to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the US West Coast or make a ground landing at either Edwards Air Force Base in California or White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico This is similar in profile to the Shuttles abort once around AOA profile

If the SLS suffers lessthanideal performance during the initial orbit insertion it can be restarted 45 minutes later to place the Orion CSM into a less than ideal orbit that can be corrected with the onboard propellant reserves later in the flight This is similar to the Shuttles Abort To Orbit ATO profile but depending upon the stable orbit reached it may require NASA to end the mission with a landing at either Edwards or White Sands within a 24hour period

The four abort modes would also be used if the Max Launch Abort System MLAS a proposed alternative to the LAS is flown in place of the LAS The MLAS which resembles the LAS but without the Soyuzlike rocket tower uses a strengthened boost protective cover but with the main rockets placed inside of the BPC itself

Hairy Hands
The Hairy Hands is a ghost storylegend that built up around a stretch of road in Dartmoor in the English county of Devon which was purported to have seen an unusually high number of motor vehicle accidents during the early 20th century

The legend of the Hairy Hands is set in Postbridge Dartmoor The road is now known as the B3212

According to the story surrounding them the Hairy Hands are a pair of disembodied hands that appear suddenly grab at the steering wheel of a moving car or the handlebars of a motorcycle and then force the victim off the road In some cases the hands are described as being invisible

Since around 1910 drivers and cyclists have reported suffering unusual accidents along the road between Postbridge and Two Bridges In many cases the victims reported that their vehicle had jolted or swerved violently and steered off the side of the road as if something had taken hold of the wheels and wrenched it out of their control

In most instances the victims ran into a verge and survived Their experiences remained a local curiosity until June 1921 when Dr EH Helby the medical officer for Dartmoor Prison was killed when he lost control of his motorcycle combination Two young girls children of the prison governor who had been riding in the sidecar survived Several weeks after Dr Helbys death there was another incident in which a coach driver lost control injuring several passengers who were thrown out of their seats Then on 26 August 1921 an army Captain reported that a pair of invisible hands had taken hold of him and forced his motorcycle off the road after which the story was picked up by newspapers in London and the story became known nationwide

In Supernatural Dartmoor by Michael Williams there is a story told by journalist and author Rufus Endle He claimed that while driving near Postbridge on an unstated date a pair of hands gripped the driving wheel and I had to fight for control He managed to avoid a crash and the hands disappeared as inexplicably as they had come He requested that Williams not publish the story until after his death for fear of ridicule

Not all reported incidents occurred in moving vehicles In one incident in 1924 a woman camping on the moor with her husband reported seeing a hairy hand attempting to gain access to her caravan during the night She reported that the hand retreated after she made the sign of the Cross

After the story of the Hairy Hands appeared in the national press several investigations were carried out into the road It was eventually determined that the accidents were most likely due to the camber of the roads surface which reached dangerous levels in places and was duly altered

According to local sceptics most of the accidents were caused by people who were unfamiliar with the area driving too fast down narrow country roads with high walled sides resulting in them either losing control or misjudging the road and running off its edges

Most variations of the legend of the Hairy Hands do not specify the origins of the hands or attribute to them any specific purpose other than driving motorists off the road A few local versions of the story attribute the hands to an unnamed man who died in an accident on the road

It Begins Again
It Begins Again is the tenth studio album recorded by Dusty Springfield and the ninth released Recorded during the middle of 1977 It Begins Again was her first completed and released album since Cameo five years earlier Two of the albums titles Turn Me Around and A Love Like Yours Dont Come Knocking Every Day were tracks from the abandoned 1974 Longing sessions and Springfield decided to record new versions of both songs for It Begins Again placing Chi Coltranes Turn Me Around as the opening track

It Begins Again which was Springfields debut album for the United Artists label in the US and Mercury Records in the UK was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Englishman Roy Thomas Baker at the time best known for helping create the four first albums by Queen Musically It Begins Again was however geared towards the American adult contemporary pop and disco markets Contributing on the album were some of the most renowned American session musicians of the era such as Jay Graydon Jeff Baxter Joe Sample Ed Greene and David Paich and it featured backing vocals by Pattie Brooks Dianne Brooks and Brenda Russell  all acclaimed recording artists and composers in their own right The songs on the album were also written by a number of notable composers and lyricists among others Nona Hendryx Lesley Gore Ellen Weston Dean Parks Peter Allen and Carole Bayer Sager Barry Manilows Sandra often singled out as the highlight of the set is a gentle piano ballad that portrays the life of a suburban housewife who minutely details her daily chores all the while assuring both herself and the listener that I swear I love my husband and I swear I love my kids  yet in the last verse she reveals that she one day found herself cutting her wrists doing the dishes quite by mistake It was real touch and go for a while

Containing a diverse range of styles It Begins Again was seen as somewhat experimental by Springfield herself as well as music critics who generally gave it favourable reviews Despite the critical reception the hopeful album title as well as a series of promotional performances made in both the US and the UK promoting the uptempo singles A Love Like Yours and Thats the Kind of Love Ive Got for You It Begins Again only briefly made the charts in Britain peaking at No 41 and did not chart in the US Springfield stated that she had wanted to try something different but felt that she now needed to move into a different style a commercial lightweight RB which resulted in the following album Living Without Your Love

In 2002 MercuryUniversal Music UK released the album on CD for the first time then also including Tom Moultons extended remix of Thats the Kind of Love Ive Got for You originally only released as a promotional 12 single which took advantage of the popularity of disco at the time The song which was the closing track on It Begins Again was however the only true disco song on the album The 12 version was somewhat popular with US deejays and the track in fact managed to reach No 31 in the US Hot Dance Club Play chart

When the Pet Shop Boys in 2005 released their instalment in the mix album series  they both included a Dusty Springfield track Neil Tennant chose her 60s classic Goin Back  and Chris Lowe rather surprisingly the ballad Id Rather Leave While Im in Love from It Begins Again

In Rio de Janeiro TV Tupi was broadcast on Tupi Channel 6 and had its own station and studios there In Braslia TV Tupi was retransmitted by TV Braslia on Channel 6 In Salvador TV Tupi was retransmitted by TV Itapoan on Channel 5 Other TV Stations were formed by the Rede de Emissoras Associadas Network of Associated Broadcasters all Tupi affiliates and directly operated stations

Named for the Tupiniquim tribe in Brazil Rede Tupi was a pioneer in television programming in South America setting the tone for the best dramas news programming sports theater and entertainment in the 1950s and 1960s such as TV de Vanguarda Vanguard TV O Reprter Esso The Esso Reporter Alo Docura Clube dos Artistas 195280 Beto Rockfeller O Mundo e das Mulheres The World for Women and many more It led the way for the establishment of television stations throughout Brazil and in 1960 beat other stations in broadcasting via satellite the first Brazilian TV network to achieve such a feat in honor of the formal opening of Brasilia

Its success prompted other nations in the continent to have television stations The network added new talent to Brazilian show business which was then a thriving industry depending on movies and radio During the 1960s its programs revolutionized television through animation humor comedy and childrens shows plus the telenovelas that gave rise to the 1965 launch of its rival network in Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo

Tupi had its own mark in news Rede Tupi de Noticias Tupi News Network became one of its successful broadcasts The newscast was unique because it was broadcast three times each night Ana Maria Braga was the main presenter It had three sections sports local news and nationalworld news

In 1964 it became Brazils second television network to broadcast in color following Rede Excelsior in 1962 After its founders death in 1968 the network due to a crisis with its owners transitioned itself becoming the first national television network in 1970 composed of its two main stations Channels 4 and 6 its 7 other stations and 17 affiliate stations nationwide

Tupi in 1972 joined other Brazilian stations in the move to full color TV broadcasts On March 31 that very year Tupis special program Mais Cor em Sua Vida More Color in Your Life officially kicked off its color transmissions and debuted a new logo in celebration replacing the old number 6 logo used in Rio during its monochrome days

After 29 years of continuous broadcast Rede Tupi became defunct on July 16 to 18 1980 when its two stations in So Paulo Tupi Channel 4 and Rio de Janeiro Tupi Channel 6 shut down together with its 7 other stations nationwide by order of the federal government of Brazil  a military dictatorship at the time The Department of National Telecommunications did not approve the planned extension of Rede Tupis television concession The Rio station signedoff for the last time on midday of the 18th following the other stations the previous day The final days of broadcasts at the networks Rio de Janeiro studios including the 18hour long vigil were covered by various networks in Brazil including Rede Bandeirantes

Tupis So Paulo Porto Alegre and Belm channels became the nuclei of SBT Brazilian Television System then TVS TV Studios Channel 4 of the Grupo Silvio Santos Silvio Santos Group of Silvio Santos later in August 1981 Its Rio outlet became the nucleus of Rede Manchete Manchete Network Channel 9 of the Bloch Editores Bloch Editors publishing group of Adolpho Bloch in June 1983

DKW F102
The DKW F102 is a passenger car that was produced from August 1963 by the German manufacturer Auto Union Superseding the Auto Union 1000 it was the last model branded as a DKW by the manufacturer and also the last West German production car equipped with a twostroke engine 

 The last European built Auto Union 1000 and 1000S models were produced in July 1963 and the DKW F102 was presented as a replacement model in September 1963 although volume production of 2door F102s began only in March 1964 with four door cars joining them on the production line in January 1965 

It was the last model developed before the Volkswagen takeover Under Volkswagen control the F102 provided the basis for the later Audi F103 models the Audi and later Audi 72 plus 60 75 80 and Super 90

The F102 featured stateoftheart twostroke technology for its time and a unibody of modern design Nevertheless the market of the 1960s shunned twostroke engines as oldfashioned The F102 in consequence sold below the companys expectations and was the source of huge financial losses Due to this situation Volkswagen was forced to implement a radical change in 1965 The production of twostrokeengines was ended with the last F102s produced in March 1966 by when 52753 or 53053 had been produced The F102 was redesigned to accommodate a fourcylinderfourstrokeengine At this point the name of DKW was abandoned and the F102 mutated into the Audi F103 the first new Audi model since 1938

Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl
Triruthenium dodecacarbonyl is the chemical compound with the formula RuCO Classified as metal carbonyl cluster it is a dark orangecolored solid that is soluble in nonpolar organic solvents The compound serves as a precursor to other organoruthenium compounds

The cluster has D symmetry consisting of an equilateral triangle of Ru atoms each of which bears two axial and two equatorial CO ligands OsCO has the same structure whereas FeCO is different with two bridging CO ligands resulting in C symmetry

RuCO is prepared by treating solutions of ruthenium trichloride with carbon monoxide usually under high pressure The stoichiometry of the reaction is uncertain one possibility being the following

The chemical properties of RuCO have been widely studied and the cluster has been converted to hundreds of derivatives High pressures of CO convert the cluster to the monomeric ruthenium pentacarbonyl which reverts to the parent cluster upon standing
The instability of RuCO contrasts with the robustness of the corresponding FeCO The condensation of RuCO into RuCO proceeds via initial ratelimiting loss of CO to give the unstable coordinatively unsaturated species RuCO This tetracarbonyl binds RuCO initiating the condensation

Upon warming under a pressure of hydrogen RuCO converts to the tetrahedral cluster HRuCO RuCO undergoes substitution reactions with Lewis bases
where L is a tertiary phosphine or an isocyanide

At high temperatures RuCO converts to a series of clusters that contain interstitial carbido ligands These include RuCCO and RuCCO Anionic carbido clusters are also known including RuCCO and the bioctahedral cluster RuCCO RuCO derived carbido compounds have been used to synthesize nanoparticles for catalysis These particles consist of 67 atoms and thus are all surface resulting in extraordinary activity

Druginduced lupus erythematosus
Druginduced lupus erythematosus DIL or DILE is an autoimmune disorder similar to systemic lupus erythematosus SLE caused by chronic use of certain drugs These drugs cause an autoimmune response the body attacks its own cells producing symptoms similar to those of SLE There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases hydralazine procainamide and quinidine While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain Generally the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs

Signs and symptoms of druginduced lupus erythematosus include the following

These signs and symptoms are not side effects of the drugs taken which occur during short term use DIL occurs over longterm and chronic use of the medications listed below While these symptoms are similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus they are generally not as severe unless they are ignored which leads to more harsh symptoms and in some reported cases death

The processes that lead to druginduced lupus erythematosus are not entirely understood The exact processes that occur are not known even after 50 years since its discovery but many studies present theories on the mechanisms of DIL
A predisposing factor to developing DIL is Nacetylation speed or the rate at which the body can metabolize the drug This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme Nacetyltransferase A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators In addition these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators These metabolites byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein Monocytes one type of white blood cell detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL
Of the drugs that cause DIL hydralazine has been found to cause a higher incidence Hydralazine is a medication used to treat high blood pressure Approximately 5 of the patients who have taken hydralazine over long periods of time and in high doses have shown DILlike symptoms Many of the other drugs have a low to very low risk to develop DIL The following table shows the risk of development of DIL of some of these drugs on a high to very low scale




Antinuclear antibodies are usually positive in drug induced Lupus AntiNeutrophil Cytoplasmic antibodies ANCA can also be positive in association with certain drugs Furthermore AntiHistone antibodies can also be positive in drug induced lupus

AntiHistone antibodies are positive in up to 95 of patients with drug induced lupus The most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine procainamide isoniazid methyldopa chlorpromazine quinidine and minocycline

It is important to recognize early that these drugs are causing DIL like symptoms and discontinue use of the drug Symptoms of druginduced lupus erythematosus generally disappear days to weeks after medication use is discontinued Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs will quicken the healing process Corticosteroids may be used if more severe symptoms of DIL are present

Lady Knox Geyser
The Lady Knox Geyser is a geyser in the Waiotapu area of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand It is named after Lady Constance Knox the second daughter of Uchter Knox 15th Governor of New Zealand The geyser is induced to erupt daily at 1015am by dropping a surfactant into the opening of the vent Eruptions produce a jet of water reaching up to 20m and can last for over an hour depending on the weather The visible spout is made of rocks placed around the base of the spring to enhance the eruption over the years silica from the eruptions has built up to give a white coneshaped appearance

Because the geyser was discovered early in the 20th century it has no Mori name unlike almost every other thermal feature in New Zealand

In 1901 the first open prison in New Zealand was established at Waiotapu its object to accommodate some of the betterbehaved prisoners from around the jails of the Rotorua Lakes District

It was a gang of those prisoners who first discovered the clearing in which the geyser is situated and that the spring could be made to erupt by adding soap discovered when they first added soap to the hot water to wash their clothes

Horse Latitudes poetry collection
Horse Latitudes is tenth collection of poetry from the Northern Irish poet Paul Muldoon It was published by Faber and Faber on 19 October 2006 It consists of 19 sonnets each named for a battle beginning with the letter B

Its name stems from the areas north and south of the equator in which sailing ships tend to be becalmed and where sailors traditionally and possibly apocryphally threw horses overboard to lighten the ship and conserve food supplies see Horse latitudes The title was previously employed by Doors singer Jim Morrison for a song on the Strange Days album

Like many of Muldoons recent collections Horse Latitudes contains a long poem  in this case a sonnet sequence ostensibly describing battle scenes through time and place The collection also features several other characteristic features of Muldoons work such as fixed poetic forms and deft technique combined with a seemingly casual approach full of puns slantrhymes and wordplay The collection is based on serious themes and emotions Muldoon has reportedly said that the battle of Baghdad is implied by omission consistent with the themes of evasion silence and censorship

This collection contains the poem Sillyhow Stride written in memory of Warren Zevon

In his review of Horse Latitudes James Fenton of The Guardian described the work as disconcerting and praised Muldoon for the brilliance of his verbal transformations

Jim McCue of The Independent described Muldoon as a good poet in the doldrums saying that after 48 trips to the dictionary he felt the books erudition is for show and wordplay stands in for meaning instead of standing up for it

The New York Times noted the clever and obscure references which Muldoon used to convey the anger and sadness in his poetry and said the poems weird levity only darkens the tone The review of Robert Potts in The Telegraph echoed this saying the ludic nature of Muldoons work has occasionally irritated less patient readers but that his fun does not preclude his seriousness Potts also praises Muldoon for his absolute control of pitch and tone his slinky rhythms and winking jests

The Irish incarnation of The Independent said understanding Muldoon is often about as easy as to imagine Finnegans Wake outselling the Farmers Journal but added however much the subjectline veers in the end it comes home surprisingly enough to simplicity and clarity Reviewer Brian Lynch mentioned the intensely personal subject matter of his familys cancer history and the juxtaposition between this and the battles through history He concluded Muldoon more often than not manages by dint of skill to bring the private and public momentarily into balance to achieve the calm associated with the oceanic standstill found at the latitudes of the title

Inland Center
Inland Center is a regional shopping mall owned and operated by Macerich located in San Bernardino California along the southwest border adjacent to Interstate 215 and the city of Colton Within one mile of three bordering cities on the southern end of San Bernardino Redlands Colton and Loma Linda Inland Center is a single level mall anchored by Macys Sears Forever 21 and JCPenney plus 110 specialty shops and services

Originally constructed by Homart Development Company and opened in 1966 Inland Center Mall was built on top of the former Urbita Springs lake The mall started off with three major anchor buildings May Company The Broadway and Sears

The mall experienced a number of changes in the 1990s In 1993 the May Company store closed leaving the mall with only two anchors The Broadway and Sears which reduced overall traffic after merging with May Departurement Stores In 1996 a fourth anchor building was annexed in front of the malls main entrance along with a fourstory parking structure The store was RobinsonsMay Later that year Macys bought out The Broadway and converted its threestory building to a Macys location In 1999 Gottschalks moved into the old May Co building after it purchased The Harris Company and closed its store in the Carousel Mall also located in San Bernardino despite local efforts to keep Harris at their original location

In 2000 the main entrances were renovated placing trees and benches at all entrances and a new mall sign along with a new remodeled Food Court next to Sears where the old Millers Outpost was located In 2006 Macys bought out RobinsonsMay and since having two anchors on the same property was redundant decided to close the old Broadway building in favor of the more modern built RobinsonsMay building at its current location

The vacant Broadway building was sold to Mervyns in 2007 for renovation and a proposed opening in September 2008 but the Mervyns company was liquidated around that time after filing for Chapter 7 Also in October 2008 construction was made to seal off the vacant and smaller second level of the mall to public traffic In 2009 Forever 21 announced it would move into the vacant building that was partially renovated by Mervyns Gottschalks closed its doors in July 2009 after they too filed for Chapter 11 liquidation JCPenney announced that they will open at the Former Gottschalks building

In 2013 Macerich Corporation installed over 4000 solar panels on the corridor rooftops to reduce their dependence on electricity during operating hours EV Charging Stations were also installed in the parking lots at the major entrances In 2015 Sears Holdings spun off 235 of its properties including the Sears at Inland Center into Seritage Growth Properties In 2016 JCPenney opened a store in the former Gottschalks building

In 2006 the original Macys store which occupied a dated The Broadway location was closed and the more modern RobinsonsMay was converted to Macys as part of the Federated Department Stores merger with May Department Stores Mervyns was to take over the old anchor space but failed to open after their bankruptcy finalized in 2009

Construction was also completed in 2007 to seal off the lower level demolishing a staircase and glass elevator that took customers to the lower level of the mall that remained vacant after Oshmans Sporting Goods and the old video arcade closed down in prior decades After construction was completed the upper level floor was made solid and a Childrens Play Area themed after US Route 66 was built near the old staircase location

On January 2008 parking lots adjacent to the parking structure and a small portion of the underutilized western parking areas of the mall were used in the recent SANBAG and CalTrans I215 expansion project The Inland Center Drive overpass reopened next to the mall in April 2010

During 2009 two adjacent pads to Inland Center owned by Macerich corporation were razed and placed for sale On North Mall Blvd and E Street Formerly a Citibank branch and South Mall Blvd and E Street Formerly Buffalo Ranch Restaurant

A distinctive feature of Inland Center is the large cement vault in the center of the mall serving as its main entrance prior to 1988 The vault today serves as the walkway between Macys and Forever 21 with smallerformat stores along each side and a perpendicular main walkway with fullsize inline stores crossing the vault to reach Sears and JCPenney

The mall currently hosts four anchors the most recent being J C Penney Upon opening in 1966 the mall contained Sears The Broadway and May Company The two anchors aside from Sears both ceased to exist by 1995 being replaced by Macys RobinsonsMay and Gottschalks respectively By 2009 the mall had remained at two anchors due to the closure of the southern wing Gottschalks until the opening of Forever 21 at the Broadway building Today the malls four anchors occupy the former tenants and remains as such

<doc id="7702085" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702085" title="Pharyngula blog">
Pharyngula blog
Pharyngula a blog founded and written by PZ Myers is hosted on ScienceBlogs 20052011 in full and 2011present in part and on FreeThoughtBlogs 2011present In 2006 the science journal Nature listed it as the topranked blog written by a scientist based on popularity The blog addresses a range of topics including Myers academic specialty biology It has become particularly wellknown for Myers writing style characterized by sarcasm and for his criticism of intelligent design and creationism In 2009 Hemant Mehta ranked Pharyngula the most popular atheist blog based on subscriber levels and other factors

According to Alexa Internet Pharyngulaorg was started on June 19 2002 It started out as an experiment in writing instruction for a class Students were required to submit miniessays to be published online After the project was finished Myers still had the webpublishing software and started to use it personally The blog is named after his favourite stage in embryonic development the pharyngula stage Pharyngula moved to hosting at ScienceBlogs in 2005

In 2007 Myers reviewed Stuart Pivars book Lifecode which argues that selforganization at the embryonic and fetal stages determines the development and final structure of organisms Myers reviewed the book negatively stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivars imagination and had no basis in actual evidence After some discussion in the comments threads of Pharyngula Pivar sued Myers for libel Within a week Pivar withdrew the lawsuit stating that the real issue got sidelined and that his problem was more with Seed Media Group

In June 2008 Myers commented on national press reports that a University of Central Florida student took a host Eucharist wafer from a Catholic Mass in response to forcible attempts to stop him from carrying it back to his seat where he claimed he planned to show it to a fellow student who was curious about the Catholic faith After death threats were directed against the student by some who were offended by the students behavior Myers composed his first blog post on the topic
After describing the harassment leveled against the student he asked readers to acquire for him consecrated Eucharistic hosts which he might show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare and could treat with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web Bill Donohues Catholic League responded with a letter demanding the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature take action against Myers Proponents of this action noted that Myerss blog could be reached from his university web page Myers has received several death threats and much hate mail over the controversy

In August 2011 Myers and others founded a new blog network FreethoughtBlogs to host Pharyngula and other blogs in the atheistsecular field According to Myers the move was made as an acceptable compromise between him and National Geographic who at that time would be taking a more active role in hosting the ScienceBlogs stable and therefore bringing their standards  practices which are different from the more freewheeling policies of Seed Media and would cause a culture clash Myers stated that NatGeo and I have worked out an acceptable compromise This site on Freethoughtblogs is not in any way associated with National Geographic and that he would only crosspost to his original site on ScienceBlogs whatever I write that I feel is compatible with the more conservative ethos of National Geographic As such since August 2011 the complete Pharyngula has appeared on FreethoughtBlogs and a limited selection of those posts  the more sciencefocused ones  are crossposted to the ScienceBlogshosted version

In September 2012 Myers announced that blogger and environmentalist Chris Clarke would become Pharyngulanowikinowikis coauthor Clarke left the blog in August 2013 partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of Pharyngula commenters 

Myers often criticizes intelligent design creationism and pseudoscientific movements and posts on subjects such as science religion politics superstition and education His experience in evolutionary developmental biology and as a teacher provides depth to the subjects of science and education One theme that arises regularly is that of cephalopods creatures that Myers finds quite fascinating

In particular Myers frequently offers specific criticisms of creationism including intelligent design as well as the Discovery Institute Answers in Genesis and other groups that promote pseudoscientific ideas For example in February and March 2007 he focused many of his posts on creationist neurosurgeon Michael Egnor who had recently joined the Discovery Institute In addition to Myers criticisms of Egnors arguments on evolution and Intelligent Design Myers criticized the Discovery Institutes reliance on someone whose expertise wasnt relevant to evolution

In early April 2007 Myers participated in an April Fools Day joke arranged by The Pandas Thumb which manufactured a website spoofing the Discovery Institutes page on which Egnor admitted that his association with the Discovery Institute was itself an April Fools joke This elaborate prank succeeded in fooling many of his readers while others succeeded in spotting jokes in the design of the false Discovery Institute page and concluded that this admission was itself the prank He made a point the following day that he perceived it as getting exceedingly difficult to believe some creationists were for real cf Poes Law and highlighted a quote by Stephen Meyer

In June 2005 Myers criticized a cartoon by biblical literalist Jim Pinkoski which claimed that the Biblical line There were giants in the earth in those days Genesis 64 was literally intended to convey that early humans were much taller than their modern counterparts Pinkoski placed Adam at tall and Noah at tall What Myers found most interesting about this cartoon however was the note on it which read literally NOTE If you doubt this is possible how is it there are PYGMIES  DWARFS 

Myers argued that the existence of pygmies and dwarfs now is a non sequitur when it comes to whether humans were tall 6000 years ago If Pinkoskis claims were valid humans would perhaps continue to decrease in height and approach that small size at some time in the future but this does not mean those small humans would exist now barring the use of time travel a claim Pinkoski never makes Myers went on to mock the irrelevance of this argument with parodies such as


The phrase has since been picked up by various bloggers to ridicule creationist arguments and is also popular with commenters at The Pandas Thumb The phrase is generally capitalized and bolded to match how it originally appeared in Pinkoskis cartoon

Myers has voiced the position that many of the responses to Richard Dawkins The God Delusion are what he calls Courtiers Replies Replying to critics who felt that Dawkins ignored sophisticated versions of modern theology Myers compared them to courtiers fawning on the legendary emperor who had no clothes

In other words critics complain about Dawkins not studying aspects of theology that are irrelevant to whether or not God exists in the same way as scholarly writings about imperial fashion are irrelevant when the emperor is naked Dawkins himself quoted the Courtiers Reply in a debate with Alister McGrath He also referenced the Courtiers Reply in the preface to The God Delusionnowikinowikis 2007 paperback edition

Another recurring trope has been Myers reaction to the label fundamentalist atheist bestowed by some upon him Dawkins and others who espouse similar views Myers writes
The new atheism I dont like that phrase either is about taking a core set of principles that have proven themselves powerful and useful in the scientific world  youve probably noticed that many of these uppity atheists are coming out of a scientific background  and insisting that they also apply to everything else people do These principles are a reliance on natural causes and demanding explanations in terms of the real world with a documentary chain of evidence that anyone can examine The virtues are critical thinking flexibility openness verification and evidence The sins are dogma faith tradition revelation superstition and the supernatural There is no holy writ and a central idea is that everything must be open to rational evidencebased criticism  its the opposite of fundamentalism

Eventually Myers summarized his stance by invoking Blakes Law named for Pharyngula commentator Blake Stacey As formulated by Stacey in 2007 based in concept on Godwins Law
In any discussion of atheism skepticism etc the probability that someone will compare a vocal atheist to religious fundamentalists increases to one

Myers is strongly feminist and has written about discrimination against women

Myers has made frequent use of the phrase deep rifts to satirize perceptions that atheism could experience a religious schism over disagreements on marketing atheism or the role of science and religion Myers does not deny there are some differences of opinion between prominent atheists but contends this is a good thing and is attributed to the freethinking nature of atheism

Pacific Press Publishing Association
The Pacific Press Publishing Association or Pacific Press for short is one of two major Seventhday Adventist publishing houses in North America It was founded in 1874 by James White in Oakland California and is now located in Nampa Idaho Its titles include theological works as well as books on topics such as vegetarianism and home schooling It owns its own printing operation It is owned by the North American Division of Seventhday Adventists

The Seventhday Adventist Church was formally organized and named in 1863 It began to realize its great mission to go into all the world and preach the gospel Consequently Elders JN Loughborough and DT Bourdeau came to California in 1866 And by May 1871 there were 130 Adventists in California in the San Francisco and Santa Rosa area

Late in 1872 James and Ellen White and their two sons Willie and James Edson came to California in the interest of the newly established work of the church on the Pacific Coast Plans were laid for the establishment of a health institute and a branch publishing house However no funds were available nor was a site yet secured

One day while crossing the ferry from San Francisco to Oakland Mrs White through inspiration spoke to her husband Somewhere in Oakland she said is the place to locate the paper

So in 1874 James White began to publish the Signs of the Times in Oakland It was printed under the aegis of Elder James White Editor and Proprietor The date of the first issue June 4 1874 The subscription price 200 a year to all those able to pay the subscription price and free to all others as far as the paper is sustained by donations of liberal friends of the cause These were the terms

In the fall of 1874 at a camp meeting in Yountville the president of the California Conference Elder Loughborough presented the need of a publishing house to the people assembled That day 19414 was given in gold and in pledges There were less than 500 members in the congregation

Soon construction of a plant on Castro Street in Oakland began This became known as the Pacific Seventhday Adventist Publishing Association Equipment installed included a fourroller airspring drum cylinder press powered by an upright donkey engine a paper cutter a book trimmer and some new type Soon the Signs of the Times circulation had passed 4000

By 1887 the investment of Pacific Press had grown to 200000 and the annual business totaled 150000 From its beginning the Press prospered The press became well known on the West Coast for its quality work and prompt delivery of printing orders

Around the start of the 20th century the subscription list of Signs of the Times was nearly 50000 Retail sales of the book department amounted to 94000 However commercial work continued to occupy an important place in production At times denominational work was set aside to accommodate the commercial It was felt that commercial work was necessary to keep the machinery going and profits coming in

Mrs White encouraged management to move away from the city which was developing so rapidly around the plant The town of Mountain View wished to raise its status in the state The town leaders upon hearing that the Pacific Seventhday Adventist Publishing Association in Oakland which had gained a fair and growing reputation was looking for a more rural atmosphere in which to establish itself offered the Press five choice acres of land as well as a pair of lots for a church or meeting house

The Press accepted the offer of the of land and in 1904 they moved to Mountain View Along with the plant came the families As a result real estate in Mountain View began to advance and area business grew

A brick building soon took shape on the land donated by the town and work began to come in from customers who patronized the plant in Oakland Mrs White implored Management to rely on God alone and give up the commercial work that had followed them from Oakland and had received priority over church publications

At 518 in the morning of April 18 1906 a great earthquake convulsed the whole bay area The walls of the plant crumbled Its offices were in shambles Yet within a few days the presses were running again

On July 20 three months after the earthquake on a Friday about midnight a fire of undetermined origin broke through the roof in the northeast corner of the photoengraving room In two hours the entire building had become a blazing inferno Although the fire was finally subdued it was not entirely extinguished and it broke out a second time This time scarcely a charred board remained The paper stock of the plant finished books type plates manuscripts  all were destroyed

Suddenly all the warnings of Mrs White came to mind Soon after the fire the Board of Directors stopped commercial work at the Pacific Press

In 1955 ownership of Chapel Records was transferred from the Pacific Union Conference of SeventhDay Adventists to Pacific Press Publishing Association

In 1982 the press lost an appeal in a case against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission wherein the court denied that the press could obtain a Title VII exemption to the employment code that would allow them to treat male and female employees differently

By the early 1980s the costofliving index in the densely populated San Francisco Bay area made it almost impossible for young families to work at the plant This among other reasons made it expedient to move the plant from Mountain View In 1983 the Board of Trustees along with the General Conference Committee voted that the plant be sold and a move made to another area

Nampa Idaho was chosen as the location for the new plant The new building contained of floor space Relocation to Idaho began in June 1984 and was completed in the late winter of 198485

The move to Idaho was an advantageous one From the humble beginning in 1874 when the first Signs of the Times was issued with Elder James White editing the paper setting the type and printing the pages and with his son as a delivery boy the institution has grown to become the employer of over 250 workers at a plant larger than three football fields and generating an annual income of over 40 million Pacific Press is the largest bulk mailer in Idaho

In 1994 Pacific Press began management of literature evangelist work with the establishment of the HHES Home Health Education Services Division Currently the HHES manages literature evangelist programs for Pacific Union North Pacific Union and Mid America Union

The Retail Division for management of Adventist Book Centers was begun in 1996 The Division operated retail locations in the US and Canada and operated a bookmobile program in the mountain states region In August 2013 the Pacific Press board voted to return management of the stores operated by the Retail Division to the local Seventhday Adventist conferences Pacific Press closed the last of its Retail Division in the United States in the second half of 2014 Operations in Canada are expected to be closed by year end

4 3 2 1 LL Cool J song
4 3 2 1 is a song by LL Cool J featuring Method Man  Redman Canibus and DMX from LL Cool Js seventh album Phenomenon as the second single It was released on December 9 1997 for Def Jam Recordings and was produced by LL Cool J and Erick Sermon A remix was made with an additional verse from American southern hip hop artist Master P Both the original song minus Canibus and the remix with Canibus and Master P had accompanying music videos The song peaked at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 number 10 on the Hot Rap Singles and number 24 Hot RBHipHop Songs

The song is notable for starting the LL Cool J vs Canibus feud LL took offense to the lines L is that a mic on your arm Let me borrow that which referenced his tattoo of a microphone on his arm  and which Canibus claimed was his own way of showing the rap veteran respect  and wrote an indirect diss to Canibus

The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers  You hold the rusty sword I swing the Excalibur

And also

Now lets get back to this mic on my arm  If it ever left my side itd transform into a time bomb  You dont wanna borrow that you wanna idolize  And you dont wanna make me mad na you wanna socialize

Before the song was released LL Cool J asked Canibus to change his lines Canibus claims that LL vowed to modify his own lines as well but the latter denied this and pointed out that nobody would know who he was talking about if only Canibuss line was changed The original version eventually leaked and fans started to piece the lines together Canibus would respond to the diss with Second Round KO LL would then respond to that diss with the Ripper Strikes Back On his 2000 GOAT album LL thanked Canibus for inspiration In addition despite appearing on the song Canibus was omitted from the original music video for the song due to the feud but was later included in the music video for the remix version

This song features a vocal sample from LL Cool Js Rock the Bells off of the album Radio Another prominent sample featured in 4 3 2 1 is from the Beastie Boys song You Gotta Fight for Your Right To Party And Superrapin by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious 5

Yoga Vasistha
Yoga Vasistha  IAST  is a philosophical text attributed to Valmiki although the real author is unknown The complete text contains over 29000 verses The short version of the text is called Laghu Yogavasistha and contains 6000 verses The text is structured as a discourse of sage Vasistha to Prince Rama The text consists of six books The first book presents Ramas frustration with the nature of life human suffering and disdain for the world The second describes through the character of Rama the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation The third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through a spiritual life one that requires selfeffort and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories These two books are known for emphasizing free will and human creative power The fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama

Yoga Vasistha teachings are structured as stories and fables with a philosophical foundation similar to those found in Advaita Vedanta is particularly associated with drstisrsti subschool of Advaita which holds that the whole world of things is the object of mind The text is notable for expounding the principles of Maya and Brahman as well as the principles of nonduality and its discussion of Yoga The short form of the text was translated into Persian by the 15thcentury

Yoga Vasistha is famous as one of the historically popular and influential texts of Hinduism Other names of this text are MahaRamayana Arsha Ramayana Vasiha Ramayana YogavasisthaRamayana and Jnanavasistha

The name Vasistha in the title of the text refers to Rishi Vasistha The term Yoga in the text refers to the underlying Yogic theme in its stories and dialogues and the term is used in a generic sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation in the style of Bhagavad Gita

The long version of the text is called Brihat Yoga Vasistha wherein Brihat means great or large The short version of the text is called Laghu Yoga Vasishta wherein Laghu means short or small The longer version is also referred to simply as Yoga Vasistha and by numerous other names such as Vasiha Ramayana

The date or century of the texts composition or compilation is unknown and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature other schools of Indian philosophies Scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second Estimates range states Chapple from as early as the sixth or seventh century to as late as the fourteenth century

The surviving text mentions Vijnanavada and Madhyamika schools of Buddhism by name suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established or about 5thcentury The translation of a version of the text in 14th to 15thcentury into Persian has been the basis of the other limit among scholars such as Farquhar in 1922

Atreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded Gaudapada and Adi Shankara because it does not use their terminology but does mention many Buddhist terms Dasgupta a contemporary of Atreya states that the text includes verses of earlier text such as its III1650 is identical to one found in Kalidasas Kumarasambhava thus the text must be placed after the 5thcentury Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara but neither mention the other which probably means that the authors of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara placing the text in about 7th to early 8thcentury The shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the Kashmiri scholar Abhinanda who has been variously dated to have lived in 9th or 10thcentury

Mainkar states that Yoga Vasistha probably evolved over time The first work states Mainkar was the original ancient work of Vasistha that was an Upanishad with Brahamanical ideas a work that is lost This text was suggests Mainkar was expanded into Moksopaya in or after 6thcentury which is now commonly known as LaghuYogavasistha The Laghu shorter version was then expanded into the full editions over time in the centuries that followed the completion of LaghuYogavasistha The syncretic incorporation of Buddhism and Hinduism ideas happened in the LaghuYogavasistha edition states Mainkar while ideas from Kashmiri Shaivism particularly the Trika school were added to the growing version by the 12thcentury Similar serial expansion revisions and interpolation is typical in Indian literature Peter Thomi has published additional evidence in support Mainkars theory on Yoga Vasisthas chronology

The oldest surviving manuscript of the Moksopaya or Moksopaya Shastra has been dated to have been composed in Srinagar in the 10th century AD

The text is traditionally attributed to Valmiki the author of Ramayana

The author of the shorter version the LaghuYogavasistha is generally considered to be Abhinanda of Kashmir

The text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses but similar message The full editions contain over 29000 to a few with 32000 verses and in some editions about 36000 verses An abridged version by Abhinanda of Kashmir son of Jayanta Bhatta is Laghu Little Yogavasistha and contains 6000 verses

The verses of Yoga Vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient Indian literature called Grantha In this genre each Shloka verse in the text is designed to equal 32 syllables while conveying its message A Grantha can be sung and depending on its meter set to specific Raga music This genre is found in Bhakti movement literature and Yoga Vasisthas Advaita theories and monism influenced the Grantha literature of Sikhism whose primary scripture is called Guru Granth Sahib

The Yoga Vasistha is a syncretismsyncretic work containing elements of Vedanta Yoga Samkhya Saiva Siddhanta Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism thus making it according to Chapple a Hindu text par excellence including as does Hinduism a mosaicstyle amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions

The text consists of six books

The Nirnaya Sagar version of Yoga Vasistha manuscript has 1146 verses in the first Book 807 in second 6304 verses in third 2414 verses in the fourth book 4322 in the fifth while the last is longest with 14296 verses for a cumulative total of 29289 verses

This is one of the longest Hindu texts in Sanskrit after the Mahabharata and an important text of Yoga It consists of Contents and stories of the Yoga Vasisthanumerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its ideas and message The text shows the influence of Advaita Vedanta and TrikaSaivite Trika school In terms of Hindu mythology the conversation in the Yoga Vasishta is placed chronologically before the Ramayana

The traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation The conversation between Vasistha and Prince Rama is that between a great enlightened sage and a seeker of liberation The text discusses consciousness cosmology nature of the universe and consciousness the ultimate dissolution of body the libertyliberation of the tman Hinduismsoul and the nondual nature of existence

The Yoga Vasistha states that there are four characteristics that mark someone ready for spiritual journey who 


Yoga Vasistha teachings are divided into six parts dispassion qualifications of the seeker creation existence dissolution and liberation It sums up the spiritual process in the seven Bhoomikas

In Chapter 2 of Book VI titled as The story of Iksvaku the text explains the state of mokshanirvana liberation as follows Liberation is peace Liberation is extinction of all conditioning Liberation is freedom from every kind of physical psychological and psychic distress This world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light To one who has attained selfknowledge this world does not appear as samsara but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness

Martin v City of Struthers
Martin v Struthers 319 US 141 1943 is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a law prohibiting the distribution of handbills from door to door violated the First Amendment rights of a Jehovahs Witness specifically their freedom of speech The ruling was 54 and deemed trespassing laws a better fit for the town imposing the ordinance

In 1943 a woman from Struthers Ohio by the name of Thelma Martin went knocking on doors to pass out Jehovahs Witness leaflets to people in her city Martins visits were not well received by some households which led to her arrest

She was convicted in the Mayors Court and fined for violating a Struthers Ohio city ordinance which made it illegal to knock on doors to distribute handouts to that contained information about religious meetings Martin confessed to handing out invitations to their religious meetings The city ordinance was created to keep solicitors from coming to peoples home and causing a disturbance

The US Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the lower court The Court held that the First Amendment protects both the right to distribute literature and the right to receive it and stated that the distribution of literature is protected even if it creates the minor nuisance for a community of cleaning litter from its streets Justice Hugo Black writing the opinion of the court stated

While door to door distributers of literature may be either a nuisance or a blind for criminal activities they may also be useful members of society engaged in the dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tradition of free discussion 

The ordinance does not control anything but the distribution of literature and in that respect it substitutes the judgment of the community for the judgment of the individual householder It submits the distributor to criminal punishment for annoying the person on whom he calls even though the recipient of the literature distributed is in fact glad to receive it 

In any case the problem must be worked out by each community for itself with due respect for the constitutional rights of those desiring to distribute literature and those desiring to receive it as well as those who choose to exclude such distributors from the home 

We conclude that the ordinance is invalid because it is in conflict with the freedom of speech and press

Therefore Martin won her right to distribute information

Justices Reed Roberts and Jackson dissented Justice Reed wrote that
The most  that can be or has been read into the ordinance is a prohibition of free distribution of printed matter by summoning inmates to their doors There are excellent reasons to support a determination of the city council that such distributors may not disturb householders while permitting salesmen and others to call them to the door Practical experience may well convince the council that irritations arise frequently from this method of advertising The classification is certainly not discriminatory

To prohibit such a call leaves open distribution of the notice on the street or at the home without signal to announce its deposit Such assurance of privacy falls far short of an abridgment of freedom of the press

LAssemble des sixcomts painting
LAssemble des sixcomts French for The Assembly of the Six Counties also known as Manifestation des Canadiens contre le gouvernement anglais  SaintCharles en 1837 Demonstration of the Canadiens against the English government at SaintCharles in 1837 is a large oil painting executed on canvas by Ontario artist Charles Alexander Smith in 1890

It depicts the Assembly of the Six Counties an event in 1837 part of the history of Quebec and the Patriote movement It is displayed in the permanent exhibition of the Muse national des beauxarts du Qubec in Quebec City

The picture includes many elements of what is known about the Patriote movement and their time It features a number of Patriote leaders upon the stage at the right with accurate appearance Patriote leader LouisJoseph Papineau is shown in a speech to the crowd At the bottom right stand three flags From the left the first represents the influence the Patriotes received from the French Revolution the second is the Patriote flag and the third embodies the admiration of the Patriote for the American Revolution The Patriote flag remains a visual leitmotiv across the composition

The right field profusely displays maple leaves a symbol of the French Canadians of the time they have now been discarded by their modernday Qubcois and Quebec nationalist successors because of their appropriation by the Canadian federation In the same section is the Coat of arms of Quebec leaning upon the wooden stage structure one anachronistic detail as this version contemporary to the paintings execution is the first arms of Quebec postConfederation granted in 1868

The crowd mesmerized and invigorated at the same time by Papineaus much celebrated oratory skills holds many signs reading nationalist and independence slogans Many in attendance wear the tuques and ceintures flches belts characteristic of the Patriote symbology The Colonne de la libert stands tall in the background the one from Henri Juliens and the contemporary replica appear much shorter Finally a very young girl at the immediate leftofthemiddle evocatively stares at the spectator

Smith was commissioned to paint it for display in the chamber of the Legislative Assembly in the Parliament of Quebec City However the government of Premier of Quebec CharlesEugne Boucher de Boucherville did not accept it and the work was passed unto various owners before finally becoming part of the Muse national des beauxarts du Qubec collection

Located in Room 10 it is a part of the permanent exhibition of Quebec historyrelated art called Je me souviens Quand lart imagine lhistoire Je me souviens motto of Quebec When Art Imagines History The picture has seen restoration Nowadays a great number of books related to the Patriotes or their era in Quebec use the painting often cropped to illustrate their cover page

In a similar fashion initial plans to erect a statue in honour of LouisJoseph Papineau on the Quebec City Parliament Hill were aborted because of the thencontroversial aspect of what was seen as a revolutionary figure A smaller statue was instead made for interior display in the Parliament and a monument such as the one originally envisioned was inaugurated in the 2000s

The Assembly of the Six Counties gathered Patriote leaders and approximately 4000 followers in SaintCharles Lower Canada presentday Quebec on October 23 and October 24 1837 Presided by Wolfred Nelson it is the most famous of the various popular assemblies held during that year protesting the Russell Resolutions It was a prelude to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 that sought the independence of a Lower Canadian republic Speakers were united in their protest of the British colonial government but as one part supported economic boycotts of British products the other appealed to an armed uprising

Born Mechel Salpeter Gordon was the youngest son of immigrants from Poland His older brother Cliff used the stage name of Gordon and Max then used it also Cliff an entertainer in vaudeville died at age 32 in 1913

Then in his early 20s Gordon within months formed a vaudeville agency with Albert Lewis his late brothers former vaudeville and burlesque partner They specialized in providing sketches for shows and their material and performers eg Phil Baker and Lou Holtz played the Keith and Orpheum circuits It was on May 24 1921 the tail end of this period months before the team produced their first play that Gordon wed Mildred Bartlett of Amsterdam New York Bartlett gave up her acting career she performed in films under the name Raye Dean a few months before the wedding at the request of her fiance

Gordon soon became one of New Yorks most successful producers from the Roaring Twenties and Depressionera on into the Eisenhower years One of his first great hits came when he presented with Lewis the original stage incarnation of The Jazz Singer which ran from September 1925 to June 1926 The year following the stock market crash of 1929 Marx the jig is up is how he famously relayed the news to his friend and frequent tip recipient Gordon became an independent producer  By 1932 broke and suffering from a nervous collapse such friends as George Kaufman offered him fifteen 
hundred of the sixteen hundred dollars Kaufman had at that time and Harpo Marx came to see him in the hospital with his pockets stuffed with cash and strewed it over the bed
It was in these years that Gordon gradually became playwright Kaufmans producer of choice  10 shows in 25 years starting in 1931 with the Astaires final musical The Bandwagon Gordon had even greater luck with the married playwrights Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin For Kanins Born Yesterday  it ran 1642 performances producer Gordon even had a hand in discovering its star Judy Holliday The minute she walked in I knew she was it

His reputation during this era was immortalized in Cole Porters song Anything Goes from the musical of the same name

Helicoverpa armigera
The cotton bollworm corn earworm or Old World African bollworm Helicoverpa armigera also known as the scarce bordered straw in the UK where it is a migrant is a moth the larvae of which feed on a wide range of plants including many important cultivated crops It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species It should not be confused with the similarly named related species Helicoverpa zea

This species comprises two subspecies Helicoverpa armigera armigera is widespread in central and southern Europe temperate Asia and Africa Helicoverpa armigera conferta is found in Australia and Oceania The former subspecies has also recently been confirmed to have successfully invaded Brazil and has since spread across much of South America and reached the Caribbean It is a migrant species able to reach Scandinavia and other northern territories

The cotton bollworm is very variable in both size and colour The body length varies between with a wingspan of  The fore wings are yellowish to orange in females and greenishgray in males with a slightly darker transversal band in the distal third The external transversal and submarginal lines and the reniform spot are diffused The hind wings are a pale yellow with a narrow brown band at the external edge and a dark round spot in the middle

The female cotton bollworm can lay several hundred eggs distributed on various parts of the plant Under favourable conditions the eggs can hatch into larvae within three days and the whole lifecycle can be completed in just over a month

The eggs are spherical and 04 to 06mm in diameter and have a ribbed surface They are white later becoming greenish

The larvae take 13 to 22 days to develop reaching up to 40mm long in the sixth instar Their colouring is variable but mostly greenish and yellow to redbrown The head is yellow with several spots Three dark stripes extend along the dorsal side and one yellow light stripe is situated under the spiracles on the lateral side The ventral parts of the larvae are pale They are rather aggressive occasionally carnivorous and may even cannibalise each other If disturbed they fall from the plant and curl up on the ground

The pupae develop inside a silken cocoon over 10 to 15 days in soil at a depth of  or in cotton bolls or maize ears

The cotton bollworm is a highly polyphagous species The most important crop hosts are tomato cotton pigeon pea chickpea rice sorghum and cowpea Other hosts include groundnut okra peas field beans soybeans lucerne Phaseolus spp other Leguminosae tobacco potatoes maize flax Dianthus Rosa Pelargonium Chrysanthemum Lavandula angustifolia a number of fruit trees forest trees and a range of vegetable crops In Russia and adjacent countries the larvae populate more than 120 plant species favouring Solanum Datura Hyoscyamus Atriplex and Amaranthus genera

The greatest damage is caused to cotton tomatoes maize chick peas alfalfa and tobacco The economic threshold of harmfulness in central Asia is three to five larvae per hundred plants of longstaple cotton and eight to 12 larvae per hundred plants on mediumstaple cotton In cotton crops blooms that have been attacked may open prematurely and stay fruitless When the bolls are damaged some will fall off and others will fail to produce lint or produce lint of an inferior quality Secondary infections by fungi and bacteria are common and may lead to rotting of fruits Injury to the growing tips of plants may disturb their development maturity may be delayed and the fruits may be dropped Control measures include the use of NOCTOVI adulticide attract and kill formulation growing of resistant varieties weeding interrow cultivation removing crop residues deep autumn ploughing winter watering to destroy the pupae the use of insecticides or biological control through the release of entomophages such as Trichogramma spp and Habrobracon hebetor Monitoring is possible by the use of sex pheromone traps Development of Bt cotton genetically modified to produce Bacillus thuringiensis toxin improved yields of lint

The Grace song
The Grace is a song written by Canadian recording artist and producer Daniel Victor in August 2005 and appears on the Neverending White Lights debut album 

The song was written with the intent of using Canadian singerperformer Dallas Green of Alexisonfire as the featured vocalist In a lastminute attempt to lift the sound of the album Victor came up with The Grace during a late night writing session only a month before the album went into stores After capturing Dallas Greens vocal parts in Toronto Ontario the song was promptly mixed and released in Canada

Every instrument and part in the song was performed and recorded by Daniel Victor in his home studio in Windsor Ontario Canada except for the violin parts Commenting on the songs name Victor stated that its about someones thoughts that dying could be a positive thing a good transition to get away from the worldand the person in the song is trying to figure out where he really belongs in this world with the help of his angelsquoted from an email reply written to a fan Themes of life and death are the main focus of Victors debut album and this song is no exception Its original title was The Grace of a Happy Death

As the first single from the album it received extensive radio play across the country eventually charting 3 on Rock Radio and 1 the Rock Audience Chart It also reached 1 on many popular radio station countdowns including Edge 102 in Toronto for 2 weeks

The music video is a cinematic bluetinged love story between a man played by Victor and a fallen angel played by musician Emm Gryner in the Victorian era It hit 1 on MuchMusic in April 2006 and on MuchMoreMusic for two weeks that same month The Grace essentially launched Neverending White Lights into the Canadian spotlight

The video starts off with glimpses of statues of angels and a camera clicking as they are filmed It then leads to a scene of Victor mending the wings of a fallen angel in his home As he sews the feathers in a long and painful process tears roll down the angels cheeks Victor wipes them off gently with a feather Over the next few days as he finishes his work plays music to her and shows her the film of the statues hed taken earlier it is evident he falls in love with her Each day the angel puts on a white pendant with the figure of a woman on it and Victor shows her a good time But at last Victors work is done and the grateful angel with her new wings touches his face gingerly before disappearing She leaves the pendant behind Heartbroken Victor commits suicide and the angel reappears then and stays by his side grieving as the song ends with one final piano note

Sabbath School
Sabbath School is a function of the Seventhday Adventist ChurchSeventh Day Baptist Church of God SeventhDay some other sabbatarian denominations usually comprising a song service and Bible study lesson on the Sabbath It is usually held before the church service on Saturday morning but this may vary

It includes programs that are Bible based to foster Christian growth This period usually lasts for a period of 1 hour 40 minutes During this time the lesson study is also conducted

Sabbath School usually begins at 930am or 1030am on Saturday mornings before the worship service starts The Sabbath School service for adults typically has two portions The first portion begins with a song service followed by a mission emphasis and a short talk The second and larger portion is the lesson study Different churches conduct Sabbath School in many ways mostly teaching on the same topic or reading in a given week as each quarter of the year has a different theme that reflects Bible doctrinal or church lifestyle teachings The lesson booklet is called the quarterly 

Sabbath School may be conducted in one large class or the congregation may separate into smaller groups for discussion in the sanctuary or in different rooms Participation is not restricted to Church members Young people often meet separately After Sabbath School the church service begins usually at 1100am

On the last Sabbath of the quarter or the 13th Sabbath a special collection is taken for a missionary project During the 13th Sabbath Program youngsters may present a music or acting special based on the subject learned that quarter or explain the traditions and dress in the attire of the countries or world regions which offerings collected will benefit Communion Service preceded by footwashing may take place on or right after the 13th Sabbath 

A 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders estimated that 67 of Adventists including 63 of under18s attend Sabbath School nearly every week

Sabbath School teachers are usually lay people selected by a designated coordinator board or committee Normally the selection is based on a perception of character and ability to teach the Bible rather than formal training in education although some Sabbath School teachers have a background in education as a result of their occupation Some churches offer courses in teaching or hold teachers classes to go over the lesson for that Sabbath other churches allow volunteers who make a profession of faith to teach without training

Adult church members are provided with the Adult Bible Study Guide formerly known as Sabbath School Quarterly issued four times a year It is also known as the Quarterly and the Lesson It is published by Pacific Press Publishing Association Sabbath School quarterlies are Bible study guides that cover a specific topic or book of the Bible every quarter The quarterly is designed to be read during the week so that during Sabbath School the class members are ready to discuss questions and topics raised in that lesson in small groups The Adult Sabbath School always has a heavy focus on the Bible All Seventhday Adventists around the world use the same Sabbath School quarterly translated into the necessary languages with few exceptions such as Germany where members cover the same topic with different material the editor of the Adult Sabbath School lessons was Clifford Goldstein

At the same time as the adult study children attend classes for their age group Typical age group divisions are Beginner infants Kindergarten K Primary Grades 13 Junior Grades 46 Earliteen Grades 78 Youth High School and Collegiate College and Young Adult Each age division has its own specific quarterly which is titled by the class name up to Primary Juniors and Earliteens often share the same quarterly entitled PowerPoints Some Earliteen groups use a separate publication entitled Real Time Faith Youth use either Cornerstone Connections or Collegiate Quarterly CQ Some churches give the children a weekly magazine at the close of Sabbath School Kindergarten receives Our Little Friend Primary receives Primary Treasure Juniors and Earliteens receive Guide and the Youth receive Insight

FMX broadcasting
FMX is the name of a commercially unsuccessful noise reduction system developed in the 1980s for FM broadcasting in the United States

FM stereo broadcasting is known to incur up to a 23 dB noise penalty over that of monophonic FM broadcasting this is due to the combination of the triangular FM noise spectrum and the wider baseband bandwidth occupied by the stereo multiplex signal Developed at the CBS Technology Center FMX was intended to improve this characteristic for listeners in the fringe areas where the noise penalty would be worst This improvement was achieved by adding an amplitudecompressed version of the LR leftminusright or difference signal modulated in quadrature with the stereo subcarrier using a version of the CX noisereduction system originally developed at CBS for LP records

Upon his accession as Chairman of CBS Laurence Tisch closed the CBS labs in 1986 whereupon the FMX intellectual property was spun off to an investment group under the name Broadcast Technology Partners BTP

With about 50 stations using the technology and perhaps another 50 committed a controversy emerged in 1989 when MIT professor and Bose Corporation CEO Amar Bose and Bose engineer William Short released a critical study finding the system to have the potential to seriously degrade the quality of stereo reception whether received by FMX equipment or not According to the study the heavy compression of the LR audio caused interference in receivers under multipath conditions A BTP spokesman rebutted the finding saying that the Bose analysis exaggerated a worstcase scenario and actually employed flawed mathematics to attempt to prove their point Perhaps not coincidentally a patent application filed earlier by Bose disclosed an invention whose implementation was incompatible with the adoption of FMX while another  filed by Bose and Short around the time of the release of the critical study  sought to improve the performance of FMX under multipath conditions

Despite industrial supporters in both the broadcast and consumer electronics industries the system never achieved a critical mass and faded into obscurity However numerous related patents have since been applied for or granted referencing the original FMX patents

<doc id="7702566" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702566" title="Supercritical fluid chromatography">
Supercritical fluid chromatography
Supercritical fluid chromatography SFC is a form of normal phase chromatography that uses a supercritical fluid such as carbon dioxide as the mobile phase It is used for the analysis and purification of low to moderate molecular weight thermally labile molecules and can also be used for the separation of chiral compounds Principles are similar to those of high performance liquid chromatography HPLC however SFC typically utilizes carbon dioxide as the mobile phase therefore the entire chromatographic flow path must be pressurized Because the supercritical phase represents a state in which liquid and gas properties converge supercritical fluid chromatography is sometimes called convergence chromatography

SFC is used in industry primarily for separation of chiral molecules and uses the same columns as standard HPLC systems SFC is now commonly used for achiral separations and purifications in the pharmaceutical industry

SFC with CO utilizes carbon dioxide pumps that require that the incoming CO and pump heads be kept cold in order to maintain the carbon dioxide at a temperature and pressure that keeps it in a liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate The CO subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved SFC as a chromatographic process has been likened to a process having the combined properties of the power of a liquid to dissolve a matrix with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of a gas The result is that you can get a lot of mass on column per injection and still maintain a high chromatographic efficiency Typically gradient elution is employed in analytical SFC using a polar cosolvent such as methanol possibly with a weak acid or base at low concentrations 1 The effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed 500K plates per metre routinely with 5um material The operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate cosolvent composition system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed 40C for supercritical conditions to be achieved with CO In addition SFC provides an additional control parameter  pressure  by using an automated back pressure regulator From an operational standpoint SFC is as simple and robust as HPLC but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and a small volume of polar cosolvent If the outlet CO is captured it can be recompressed and recycled allowing for 90 reuse of CO

Similar to HPLC SFC uses a variety of detection methods including UVVIS mass spectrometry FID unlike HPLC and evaporative light scattering

A ruleofthumb is that any molecule that will dissolve in methanol or a less polar solvent is compatible with SFC including polar solutes CO has polarity similar to nheptane at its critical point but the solvent strength can be increased by increasing density or using a polar cosolvent In practice when the fraction of cosolvent is high the mobile phase is not truly supercritical but this terminology is used regardless

The mobile phase is composed primarily of supercritical carbon dioxide but since CO on its own is too nonpolar to effectively elute many analytes cosolvents are added to modify the mobile phase polarity Cosolvents are typically simple alcohols like methanol ethanol or isopropyl alcohol Other solvents such as acetonitrile chloroform or ethyl acetate can be used as modifiers For foodgrade materials the selected cosolvent is often ethanol or ethyl acetate both of which are generally recognized as safe GRAS The solvent limitations are system and column based

There have been a few technical issues that have limited adoption of SFC technology first of which is the high pressure operating conditions Highpressure vessels are expensive and bulky and special materials are often needed to avoid dissolving gaskets and Orings in the supercritical fluid A second drawback is difficulty in maintaining pressure backpressure regulation Whereas liquids are nearly incompressible so their densities are constant regardless of pressure supercritical fluids are highly compressible and their physical properties change with pressure  such as the pressure drop across a packedbed column Currently automated backpressure regulators can maintain a constant pressure in the column even if flow rate varies mitigating this problem A third drawback is difficulty in gasliquid separation during collection of product Upon depressurization the CO rapidly turns into gas and aerosolizes any dissolved analyte in the process Cyclone separators have lessened difficulties in gasliquid separations

Emerin
Emerin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EMD gene also known as the STA gene Emerin together with LEMD3 is a LEM domaincontaining integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane in vertebrates Emerin is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle In cardiac muscle emerin localizes to adherens junctions within intercalated discs where it appears to function in mechanotransduction of cellular strain and in betacatenin signaling Mutations in emerin cause Xlinked recessive EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy cardiac conduction abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy

It is named after Alan Emery

Emerin is a 290 kDa 34 kDa observed MW protein composed of 254 amino acids Emerin is a serinerich protein with an Nterminal 20amino acid hydrophobic region that is flanked by charged residues the hydrophobic region may be important for anchoring the protein to the membrane with the charged terminal tails being cytosolic In cardiac skeletal and smooth muscle emerin localizes to the inner nuclear membrane expression of emerin is highest in skeletal and cardiac muscle In cardiac muscle specifically emerin also resides at adherens junctions within intercalated discs

Emerin is a serinerich nuclear membrane protein and a member of the nuclear laminaassociated protein family It mediates membrane anchorage to the cytoskeleton EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy is an Xlinked inherited degenerative myopathy resulting from mutation in the EMD also known clinically as STA gene Emerin appears to be involved in mechanotransduction as emerindeficient mouse fibroblasts failed to transduce normal mechanosensitive gene expression responses to strain stimuli In cardiac muscle emerin is also found complexed to betacatenin at adherens junctions of intercalated discs and cardiomyocytes from hearts lacking emerin showed betacatenin redistribution as well as perturbed intercalated disc architecture and myocyte shape This interaction appears to be regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta

Mutations in emerin cause Xlinked recessive EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy which is characterized by early contractures in the Achilles tendons elbows and postcervical muscles muscle weakness proximal in the upper limbs and distal in lower limbs along with cardiac conduction defects that range from sinus bradycardia PR prolongation to complete heart block In these patients immunostaining of emerin is lost in various tissues including muscle skin fibroblasts and leukocytes however diagnostic protocols involve mutational analysis rather than protein staining In nearly all cases mutations result in a complete deletion or undetectable levels of emerin protein Approximately 20 of cases have X chromosomes with an inversion within the Xq28 region

Moreover recent research have found that the absence of functional emerin may decrease the infectivity of HIV1 Thus it is speculated that patients suffering from EmeryDreifuss muscular dystrophy may have immunity to or show an irregular infection pattern to HIV1

<doc id="7702640" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702640" title="Cephalophore">
Cephalophore
A cephalophore from the Greek for headcarrier is a saint who is generally depicted carrying their own head In Christian art this was usually meant to signify that the subject in question had been martyred by beheading Handling the halo in this circumstance offers a unique challenge for the artist some put the halo where the head used to be others have the saint carrying the halo along with the head and some split the difference
Associated legends often tell of the saint standing and carrying his own head after the beheading

The term cephalophore was first used in a French article by Marcel Hbert Les martyrs cphalophores Euchaire Elophe et Libaire in Revue de lUniversit de Bruxelles v 19 1914

The topos can be traced to two sources In a homily on Saints Juventinus and Maximinus John Chrysostom asserted that the severed head of a martyr was more terrifying to the devil than when it was able to speak He then compared soldiers showing their wounds received in battle to martyrs holding their severed head in their hands and presenting it to Christ The other source was the Western vita of Saint Denis founder of the see of Paris who was identified in the text with Dionysius the Areopagite
John the Baptist the best known beheaded saint is not considered a cephalophore since he did not hold his own head in his hands
Thus an original and perhaps the most famous cephalophore is Denis patron saint of Paris who according to the Golden Legend miraculously preached with his head in his hands while journeying the seven miles from Montmartre to his burying place Although St Denis is the best known of the saintly headcarriers there were many others the folklorist mile Nourry counted no less than 134 examples of cephalophory in French hagiographic literature alone Given the frequency with which relics were stolen in medieval Europe stories like this in which a saint clearly indicates their chosen burial site may have developed as a way of discouraging such acts of furta sacra

A cephalophoric legend of Nicasius of Rheims tells that at the moment of his execution Nicasius was reading Psalm 119 Psalm 118 in the Vulgate When he reached the verse Adhaesit pavimento anima mea My soul is attached unto dust verse 25 he was decapitated After his head had fallen to the ground Nicasius continued the psalm adding Vivifica me Domine secundum verbum tuum Revive me Lord with your words The theme of the speaking head is extended in the 8thcentury Passio of Saint Justus of Beauvais after the child had been beheaded by Roman soldiers his father and brother found the corpse sitting with his head in his lap Giving the head to his father Justus asked him to carry it to Auxerre that his mother Felicia might kiss it 

The legend of Aphrodisius of Alexandria was transferred to Bziers where his name was inserted at the head of the list of bishops In the hagiographic accounts Aphrodisius was accompanied by his camel As he was preaching a group of pagans pressed through the crowd and beheaded him on the spot Aphrodisius picked up his head and carried it to the chapel which he had recently consecrated at the site It is identified today as Place SaintAphrodise Bziers 
Saint Gemolo is said to have survived his decapitation and after collecting his head climbed on horseback He rode to meet his uncle a bishop on a small mountain before he finally died
A legend associated with Saint Gins de la Jara states that after he was decapitated in southern France he picked up his head and threw it into the Rhne The head was carried by the sea to the coast of Cartagena in Spain where it was venerated as a relic Cartagena was the center of this saints cult

In The Golden Legend Paul the Apostle at his martyrdom stretched forth his neck and so was beheaded And as soon as the head was from the body it said Jesus Christus which had been to Jesus or Christus or both fifty times When the head was recovered and was to be rejoined to the body as a relic in response to a prayer for confirmation that this was indeed the right head the body of Paul turned to rejoin the head that had been set at its feet

In legend the female saint Osyth stood up after her execution picking up her head like Saint Denis in Paris and other cephalophoric martyrs and walking with it in her hands to the door of a local convent before collapsing there Similarly Valerie of Limoges carried her severed head away to her confessor Saint Martial

Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne is often depicted with his head on his neckshoulders and carrying a second head in his hands However he is not a cephalophore The second head is that of Saint Oswald of Northumbria who was buried with him at Durham Cathedral

In Dantes Divine Comedy Canto 28 the poet meets the spectre of the troubadour Bertrand de Born in the eighth circle of the Inferno carrying his severed head in his hand slung by its hair like a lantern upon seeing Dante and Virgil the head begins to speak

The speaking severed head appears memorably in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight

The motif Head in Stith Thompsons MotifIndex of Folk Literature reveals how universal is the anomaly of the talking severed head Aristotle is at pains to discredit the stories of talking heads and to establish the physical impossibility with the windpipe severed from the lung Moreover he adds among the barbarians where heads are chopped off with great rapidity nothing of the kind has ever occurred Aristotle was doubtless familiar with the story of the singing disembodied head of Orpheus and Homers image of heads severed so rapidly they seemed still to be speaking and Latin examples could be attested A link between Latin poets and the Middle Ages in transmitting the trope of the speaking head was noted by Beatrice White in the Latin poem on the Trojan War De Bello Troiano by Joseph of Exeter Hector whirls in the air the severed head of Patroclus which whispers Ultor ubi Aeacides Where is Achilles Aeacides my avenger
Some modern authors link the legends of cephalophores miraculously walking with their heads in their hands to the Celtic cult of heads

Kenmare Resources
Kenmare Resources plc is a mining company based in the Republic of Ireland It is listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange 
Kenmare owns and operates the Moma mine Moma is the worlds largest titanium mineral deposit located 160km from the city of Nampula in Mozambique Africa

The company was founded by Charles and Michael Carvill in 1986 to exploit mineral wealth in Mozambique 

The Company acquired the licence for the Congolone heavy mineral sands deposit in 1987 In 1994 the Company began production of graphite at the licence In 1996 BHP became licence partner Over the coming years BHP would begin appraising the Namalope Pillivi and Mualadi deposits which would ultimately become the main focus of the mining project BHP pulled out of the mine in 1999 and by 2001 Kenmare had acquired the exclusive rights to the deposit
Work began constructing the mine in 2003 Production began in 2007 and commercial production commenced in 2009

A tailings dam from mineral processing failed on 8 October 2010 destroying a nearby native village and leaving one 4 year old child missing mining resumed the following month after some 300 homes had been rebuilt

The Companys principal asset is the Moma mineral sands mine formally known as the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine located in Moma Nampula Province Mozambique It has been in production since late 2007 The mine produces 7 of the worlds ilmenite the main source of titanium metal and titanium dioxide used as a white pigment in paint It also produces 4 of the worlds zircon a source of zirconium metal

The Moma mine also produces zircon the primary application for zircon is in the manufacture of opacifiers for ceramics

The mine is estimated to have a mine life of up to 150 years The total proved and probable ore reserves under the Namalope Pilivili and Nataka mining concession are estimated as at 31 December 2017 at 1742 million tonnes grading 28 ilmenite 019 zircon and 0061 rutile containing 48 million tonnes of ilmenite 32 million tonnes of zircon and 106 million tonnes of rutile The total ore resource excluding reserves held by the Group under a combination of exploration licences and mining concessions is estimated as at 31 December 2017 at 63 billion tonnes grading 24 ilmenite 016 zircon and 0052 rutile containing 149 million tonnes of ilmenite 10 million tonnes of zircon and 33 million tonnes of rutile

Products  Markets
The Moma mine produces three main products Ilmenite Zircon and Rutile It is also currently developing plans to produce Monazite

Ilmenite is a common accessory mineral in igneous rocks sediments and sedimentary rocks in many parts of the world Apollo astronauts found abundant ilmenite in lunar rocks and the lunar regolith Ilmenite is a black irontitanium oxide with a chemical composition of FeTiO3
Ilmenite is the primary ore of titanium a metal needed to make a variety of highperformance alloys Most of the ilmenite mined worldwide is used to manufacture titanium dioxide TiO2 an important pigment whiting and polishing abrasive
Ilmenite is the main source of titanium dioxide which is used in paints fabrics plastics paper sunscreen food and cosmetics
Kenmare produces 7 of the worlds ilmenite 

Zircon is a zirconium silicate mineral with a chemical composition of ZrSiO4 It is common throughout the world as a minor constituent of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks
Zircon is present in most soils and clastic sediments Zirconrich sediments are mined and the recovered zircon is used to produce zirconium metal and zirconium dioxide These are used in a wide variety of manufactured products and industrial processes
Zircon is mainly consumed as an opacifier and has been known to be used in the decorative ceramics industry

Rutile is a titanium oxide mineral that is most commonly found in granites pegmatites and metamorphic rocks It is also found in sands derived from the weathering of these rocks Rutile also forms as slender crystals within quartz and micas It is a common mineral in the alluvial sands that are dredged for magnetite and ilmenite
Rutile is used as a coating on welding rods It is also used as an ore of titanium a metal used where light weight and high strength are needed Some rutile is used in the production of pigments for paints

Monazite is a rare phosphate mineral with a chemical composition of CeLaNdThPO4SiO4 It usually occurs in small isolated grains as an accessory mineral in igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite pegmatite schist and gneiss These grains are resistant to weathering and become concentrated in soils and sediments downslope from the host rock When in high enough concentrations they are mined for their rare earth and thorium content
Monazite is an important source of thorium cerium and other rare elements Often mined as a byproduct from heavy mineral deposits
Kenmare does not yet produce Monazite however the company announced its intention to begin production in the future

Kenmares products are raw materials for the production of many consumer products The market for ilmenite zircon and rutile is a substantial one and is heavily linked to the performance of the global economy Kenmares sales profile is geographically diverse with 18 sold into the United States 25 into Europe and 57 into Asia principally China 

Against the backdrop of a bottleneck in global supply and a very favourable market the decision was taken in 2011 to undertake a major expansion of the mine The goal of the expansion was to raise production to 1m tonnes
As the project was being developed the market cycle turned By 2016 the mine had fallen into financial crisis due to a worldwide drop in mineral prices flooding in northern Mozambique and power outages in the Moma District region6 Prices for titanium fell by about a third between 2012 and 20157 and floods that caused power outages impacted the companys production8 

The mine briefly suspended operations in June 2015 in the face of industrial action by employees unhappy about the companys costcutting measures Successful negotiation between the union the company and the Ministry of Labour had resulted in agreement on somewhat less drastic measures involving fewer layoffs than originally announced The industrial action was not organized by the union Operations resumed in early July

By 2016 the mine had fallen into financial crisis due to a worldwide drop in mineral prices flooding in northern Mozambique and power outages in the Moma District region Prices for titanium fell by about a third between 2012 and 2015 and floods that caused power outages impacted the companys production 

In June 2014 following media speculation in Australia both Iluka and Kenmare Resources announced that the former Company had many an approach to Kenmare based on a paper transaction regarding a possible takeover No formal offer was made although a number of prices were put forward
The process carried on over an extended period during which Iluka returned with a lower offer  The Iluka approaches failed to attract support from Kenmares largest shareholder and Iluka ultimately ended the process in December 2015

As Iluka were announcing their decision to withdraw from takeover talks Kenmare management announced that the Oman Sovereign Wealth Fund had indicated an interest in investing 100m based on an overall restructuring arrangement being accepted by shareholders The deal which would ultimately be agreed saw the Omanis invest 100m of an overall 275 refinancing of the company Lenders to the Company agreed to substantially reduce debt Existing shareholders also experienced a write down as new shares were issued The overall impact of the restructuring was to leave the company with a substantially strengthened Balance Sheet placing the Company on a firm financial footing 

Since the completion of the Mine expansion production and shipments have risen to record levels Production in 2017 was just short of 1m tonnes Kenmare reported a return to profit in 2017 Full year profits after tax of 194m were reported by the Company On October 16th 2018 Kenmare announced their first dividend policy They indicated dividend payments would commence in 2019

In their interim results in August 2018 Kenmare announced a number of projects which had either been approved or were under active consideration The goal of these projects is to increase long term production to 12m tonnes of ilmenite and associated products These include the upgrade of an existing Wet Concentrator Plant development of a new Wet Concentrator Plant and a project to recover Monazite from existing operations

Grey peacockpheasant
The grey peacockpheasant Polyplectron bicalcaratum also known as Burmese peacockpheasant is a large Asian member of the order Galliformes It is the national bird of Myanmar

It is a large pheasant up to 76cm long and greyish brown with finely spotted green eyespots an elongated bushy crest bare pink or yellow facial skin white throat and grey iris bill and legs The sexes are rather similar but the female is smaller darker and less ornamented than the male The young resemble the female

The grey peacockpheasant is distributed in lowland and hill forests of Bangladesh Northeast India and Southeast Asia but excluding most of Indochina as well as the entire Malayan Peninsula The diet consists mainly of seeds termites fruits and invertebrates The female usually lays two eggs

Widespread throughout its large range the grey peacockpheasant is evaluated as a Species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species It is listed on CITES Appendix II restricting trade in wildcaught birds to preserve its stocks

Three subspecies are recognized today as good while an additional one is of unclear validity

One previous subspecies the Hainan peacockpheasant P b katsumatae has since been given approved species AS status by the IOC

Lowes grey peacockpheasant was described from a captive bird of unknown provenance Similar examples have turned up on occasion but the validity and  if distinct  home range of this taxon remains unknown It was theorized to inhabit western Assam or the eastern Himalayas but this is based on conjecture

The phylogeny of this species is fairly enigmatic mtDNA cytochrome b and Dloop as well as the nuclear ovomucoid intron G sequence data confirms that it belongs to a largely Continental Asian clade together with Germains peacockpheasant P germaini but also the brown southern species bronzetailed peacockpheasant P chalcurum and mountain peacockpheasant P inopinatum

The ovomucin sequence seems to have evolved convergently or with a decreased mutational rate on the grey and the bronzetailed peacockpheasant Though they are quite similar on the molecular level the distance and interspersed populations of their closest relatives argue against a much more recently shared common ancestry between them versus the other two northern peacockpheasants Also the cytochrome b and Dloop data does not support a closer relationship between P bicalcaratus and P chalcurum overall as it seems the four species ancestors separated during a very short timespan

Note however that in the absence of dedicated phylogeographic studies the molecular data is only of limited value in this species the most morphologically diverse and widespread peacockpheasant There is no data on the origin and number of specimens but it is unlikely that more than one or two individuals  possibly of captive origin and undeterminable subspecific allocation  were sampled All that can be reasonably assumed is that the grey peacockpheasant evolved on mainland Southeast Asia probably during the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene 361 million years ago

Overseas Tankship UK Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd
Overseas Tankship UK Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd commonly known as Wagon Mound No 1 is a landmark tort law case which imposed a remoteness rule for causation in negligence The Privy Council held that a party can be held liable only for loss that was reasonably foreseeable Contributory negligence on the part of the dock owners was also relevant in the decision and was essential to the outcome although not central to this cases legal significance

The Wagon Mound No 1 should not be confused with the successor case of the Overseas Tankship v Miller Steamship or Wagon Mound No 2 which concerned the standard of the reasonable man in breach of the duty of care

Overseas Tankship had a ship the Wagon Mound docked in Sydney Harbour in October 1951 The crew had carelessly allowed furnace oil also referred to as Bunker oil to leak from their ship The oil drifted under a wharf thickly coating the water and the shore where other ships were being repaired Hot metal produced by welders using oxyacetylene torches on the respondents timber wharf Morts Dock at Sheerlegs Wharf fell on floating cotton waste which ignited the oil on the water The wharf and ships moored there sustained substantial fire damage In an action by Morts Dock for damages for negligence it was found as a fact that the defendants did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know that the oil was capable of being set alight when spread on water The dock owners knew the oil was there and continued to use welders

The leading case on proximate cause was Re Polemis which held that a defendant can be deemed liable for all consequences flowing from his negligent conduct regardless of how unforeseeable such consequences are As this case was binding in Australia its rule was followed by the New South Wales Court of Appeal The defendant appealed to the Privy Council

The Privy Council found in favour of the defendant agreeing with the expert witness who provided evidence that the defendant in spite of the furnace oil being innately flammable could not reasonably expect it to burn on water The Board indicated Morts would probably have been successful if they had claimed damages for direct damage by the oil to the slipway but this was minor and not part of the damages claimed although success on this count may have saved Morts Dock and Engineering the costs of all the litigation for both parties across all three levels of court Viscount Simonds in his delivery for the Privy Council said that the Counsel for Morts had discredited their own position by arguing that it couldnt have been bunkering oil because it wouldnt burn on water The Privy Councils advice soundly disapproved the rule established in Re Polemis as being out of the current of contemporary thought and held that to find a party liable for negligence the damage must be reasonably foreseeable The council found that even though the crew were careless and breached their duty of care the resulting extensive damage by fire was not foreseeable by a reasonable person although the minor damage of oil on metal on the slipway would have been foreseeable

Viscount Simonds delivered the judgment of the Board and said

It is no doubt proper when considering tortious liability for negligence to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed to him by the defendant a breach of that duty by the defendant and consequent damage But there can be no liability until the damage has been done It is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded  Who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of nature But if it would be wrong that a man should be held liable for damage unpredictable by a reasonable man because it was direct or natural equally it would be wrong that he should escape liability however indirect the damage if he foresaw or could reasonably foresee the intervening events which led to its being done

It is a principle of civil liability subject only to qualifications which have no present relevance that a man must be considered to be responsible for the probable consequences of his act To demand more of him is too harsh a rule to demand less is to ignore that civilised order requires the observance of a minimum standard of behaviour

Up until this time the leading case had been Re Polemis where the central question was that of the directness of the chain of events between the triggering act being examined for negligence and the result The Council decided that rather than go with precedent authority they would determine a principle from a range of cases in a similar way as Lord Atkin did in Donoghue v Stevenson and their principle was primarily a single test for foreseeability which they argued was a logical link between the damage and the liability culpability Stated differently foreseeability was the logical link between and the test for breach of the duty of care and the damages This is the supreme test and may be rephrased as the liability of a consequence  was natural or necessary or probable The Lords made reference to hindsight indicating it is nothing like foresight and should play no role in assessing negligence There is authority to challenge this view of hindsight in Page v Smith Lord Lloyd stated In the case of secondary victims ie persons who were not participants in an accident the defendant will not be liable unless psychiatric injury is foreseeable in a person of normal fortitude and it may be legitimate to use hindsight in order to be able to apply the test of reasonable foreseeability

The Lords gave Morts the opportunity to sue in nuisance but there is no record of them testing this action in that tort The common law rules of causation have had their importance lessened by the promulgation of statute law in Australia Contributory negligence is now essential for many determinations and are covered by statutes such as the Civil Liability Act 1936 South Australia which has more recent counterparts in a number of jurisdictions including New South Wales

Community College of the Air Force
The Community College of the Air Force CCAF is a federal program offered by the United States Air Force which grants twoyear Associate of Applied Science AAS degrees in association with Air University CCAF serves approximately 300000 active guard and reserve enlisted personnel making CCAF the worlds largest community college system The college awards over 22000 associate in applied science degrees from 71 degree programs annually

The CCAF is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools through Air University

In the early 1970s the Air Force decided to attempt to gain accreditation and recognition for Air Force training programs Representatives of the Air Training Command ATC Air University and the United States Air Force Academy held numerous conferences in 1971 to discuss increased training for Air Force noncommissioned officers NCOs These conferences in turn recommended the foundation of an Air Force community college On 9 November 1971 Gen John D Ryan Air Force Chief of Staff approved the establishment of the Community College of the Air Force The Secretary of the Air Force approved the plan 25 January 1972 and the college was officially established on 1 April 1972 at Randolph AFB TX

Until the mid1970s the CCAF offered only certificate programs It became apparent that CCAF standards exceeded the minimum requirements of associate degree programs in civilian community colleges Therefore in 1975 the Air Force sought degreegranting authority for the college from Congress President Gerald R Ford signed Public Law 94361 on 14 July 1976 authorizing the AETC commander to confer the associate degree

Following an evaluation in October 1976 the US Commissioner of Education certified degreegranting authority in January 1977 The college awarded its first AAS degree in April 1977

When the Commission on Occupational Education Institution charter was limited in 1975 to nondegreegranting institutions the CCAF began seeking accreditation from the SACS Commission on Colleges The Commission on Colleges accredited the CCAF on 12 December 1980 In 2004 Air University became accredited by the SACS Commission on Colleges to award associate and masters degrees CCAF now shares in Air Universitys regional accreditation CCAF was separately accredited by SACS from 1980 to 2004

Currently the CCAF is only open to airmen but Congressman Sestak added language to the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act to open admission to all branches

The program combines the technical education offered by Air Force schools with a core of general education from regionally accredited civilian institutions and management education from Air Force or civilian sources

The CCAF offers Associates of Applied Science degrees in five broad career areas


Within those 5 broad areas the CCAF currently offers 67 specific degree programs

In June 2007 Air University announced a new program where fouryear colleges accept the entire value 60 credits of the CCAF Associate degree towards a bachelors degree requiring only 60 more credits typically upper division core classes This program is called the Air University AssociateToBaccalaureate Cooperative It has been publicized as a convenient way for an Airman to complete their 4year degree It has also served to boost the desirability of a CCAF degree as there is a notion among the enlisted members that a CCAF Associate degree only holds value in the Air Force community As of October 2009 the AUABC program included 42 civilian colleges and universities offering 209 bachelors degree programs Thirtysix of the ABC schools hold regional accreditation and six hold national accreditation through the Distance Education Accrediting Commission formerly the Distance Education and Training Council For additional information on accreditation please refer to the Council for Higher Education Accreditation CHEA or US Department of Education websites

HansEkkehard Bob
Hans Ekkehard Bob 24 January 1917  12 August 2013 was a German fighter pilot serving with the Luftwaffe During World War II Bob flew approximately 700 combat missions and claimed 60 victories 37 of which were on the Eastern Front

Bob joined the Luftwaffe in 1936 at the rank of a Fahnenjunker officer candidate and began his flight training on 1 June 1937

In 1939 prior to the Invasion of Poland Bob was transferred to the newly formed 3Jagdgeschwader 21 JG 21 later known as the Devils Squadron which was redesignated on 6 June 1940 into 9Jagdgeschwader 54 JG 54 It was equipped with the Bf 109 fighter an aircraft Bob would become very familiar with over the years  flying every model except the Kurfrst

During the French campaign on 10 May 1940 Bob claimed his first victory when he shot down a Gloster Gladiator over Tongeren in Belgium That August he was promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant On 10 October 1940 he was appointed Staffelkapitn of 7JG 54 for a short period he was soon appointed Staffelkapitn of 9JG 54

During the Battle of Britain 9JG 54 was activated as a Jabo unit targeting shipping vessels By November 1940 Bob had recorded 19 kills and was awarded the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes by Reichsmarschall Hermann Gring on 7 March 1941

On 21 March 1941 Bob survived unhurt a ditching into Cherbourg harbour with his B 131 training aircraft which had suffered engine failure After the Battle of Britain he participated in the Balkan campaign where he recorded his 20th and 21st victories JG 54 was reequipped with the new Bf 109 F and relocated to airfields in Prussia in preparation for Operation Barbarossa the invasion of Russia

On 23 June 1941 Hans Ekkehard Bob recorded his first victory in Russian airspace  a Tupolev SB twinengined bomber During this combat his Bf 109 F2 was hit by return fire resulting in a forced landing behind enemy lines He evaded capture and returned to his unit two days later Between 13 July and 30 October 1941 Bob made three more emergency landings due to aircraft combat damage behind enemy lines but in each case returned to his unit

On 29 September 1942 Bob had his 50th victory and was promoted to Hauptmann later that year Flying on the Eastern Front ended for Hans Ekkehard Bob and IIIJG 54 in February 1943 after he received orders from General der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland to change positions with elements of the then Frenchbased JG 26 This order was later cancelled but III Gruppe stayed on the Western Front separated from the rest of the Greenhearts serving initially in northern Germany with Jagdgeschwader 1

On 17 April 1943 Bob recorded his 57th victory the ramming of a USAAF Boeing B17 bomber near Bremen with his Bf 109 G6 He bailed out and survived the crash without injury On 1 August Bob was promoted to the rank of Major and was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of IVJG 54 He returned to the Eastern Front where he scored a further two victories

By May 1944 Bob was back at the Western Front as Gruppenkommandeur of IIJagdgeschwader 3 JG 3 based in the Normandy invasion front corridor flying Reichsverteidigung Defense of the Reich duties In August he was transferred to Erprobungskommando 262 where he learned to fly the Messerschmitt Me 262

In early 1945 his experience led to his becoming a member of General der Flieger Josef Kammhubers staff Bob was responsible for allocating newly built Me 262s to operational units Later he took command of I and IIEJG 2 and was responsible for practice and training former bomber pilots in flying the Me 262

Bob was one of the aces chosen to fly as a member of the jet fighter unit JV 44 led by Adolf Galland In the final days of World War II Bob was responsible for building a longer runway at Innsbruck airfield for the Me 262 jets At the capitulation on 8 May 1945 Bob was in Kappl a small village near Salzburg From Kappl he walked more than in six weeks to return to his home in Celle

Bob returned to civilian life working as a farm labourer In 1946 he founded his own transport company

Around this time he met Waldemar Wbke an old JV 44 comrade and a friend from his time in JG 54 Bob always told Wbkes history with a smile on his face Wbke still wore his old uniform and officer cap as he was questioned by a British officer Why are you wearing this old stuff Wbke replied Do I ask you if your grandma has hemorrhoids He never met Wbke again and Wbke later died in the early 1950s in Argentina the result of injuries sustained in an airliner crash

In 1956 Bob established the Celle Flying Club

From 30 September to 1 October 2000 Bob also was among the historical figures at the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Santa Monica California

Bob had been married to his wife Christa for over 50 years They had three children Roland Elmar and Delia He also had three other children with his first wife He died on 12 August 2013
