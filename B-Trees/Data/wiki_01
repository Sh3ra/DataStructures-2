Source routing
In computer networking source routing also called path addressing allows a sender of a packet to partially or completely specify the route the packet takes through the network In contrast in conventional routing routers in the network determine the path incrementally based on the packets destination Another routing alternative label switching is used in connectionoriented networks such as X25 frame relay ATM and MPLS

Source routing allows easier troubleshooting improved traceroute and enables a node to discover all the possible routes to a host It does not allow a source to directly manage network performance by forcing packets to travel over one path to prevent congestion on another

Many highperformance interconnects including Myrinet Quadrics IEEE 1355 and SpaceWire support source routing

In the Internet Protocol two header options are available which are rarely used strict source and record route SSRR and loose source and record route LSRR Because of security concerns packets marked LSRR are frequently blocked on the Internet If not blocked LSRR can allow an attacker to spoof its address but still successfully receive response packets

In IPv6 two forms of source routing have been developed The first approach was the Type 0 Routing header  This routing header was designed to support the same use cases as the IPv4 header options Unfortunately there were several important attacks against this routing header and its utilisation was deprecated A more secure form of source routing is being developed within the IETF to support the IPv6 version of Segment Routing

Softwaredefined networking can also be enhanced when source routing is used in the forwarding plane Studies have shown significant improvements in convergence times as a result of the reduced state that must be distributed by the controller into the network

When using source routing with Myrinet the sender of the packet prepends the complete route one byte for every crossbar to each packet header
Each crossbar examines the first routing byte of the packet
When using source routing that byte indicates a particular port of that crossbar when that port becomes available the router discards that routing byte and sends the rest of the packet out that port

Each packet traveling through a SpaceWire network can use path addressing source routing or logical addressing or some combination
The router examines the first data character of the packet when it indicates some specific port of the router the router discards that routing character and sends the rest of the packet out that port

Sauce Amricaine
Sauce amricaine is a recipe from classic French cookery containing chopped onions tomatoes white wine brandy salt cayenne pepper butter and fish stock It is sometimes known as sauce armoricaine which is the original name derived from Armorica the ancient name for a region of France including Brittany which is known for its fishing

Louis Saulnier gives the following recipe

Amricaine  Treat as for Lobster Amricaine Pound shells and meat in the mortar and incorporate equal quantity of fish velout add butter

As with many other classic dishes the original recipe has been adapted over time and almost every chef will prepare the sauce in a slightly different way Modern recipes usually include tarragon will use lobster stock rather than pounded lobster and often replace cayenne pepper with paprika

SaturnShuttle
The SaturnShuttle was a preliminary concept of launching the Space Shuttle orbiter using the Saturn V rocket It was studied and considered in 19711972

An interstage would be fitted on top of the SIC stage to support the external tank in the space occupied by the SII stage in the Saturn V It was an alternative to the SRBs

The addition of wings and some form of landing gear on the SIC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the Kennedy Space Center where technicians would then refurbish the booster by replacing only the five F1 engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights

The Shuttle would handle space station logistics while Saturn V would launch components 
This would have allowed a space station using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports to have been lifted with just a handful of launches The SaturnShuttle concept also would have eliminated the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters that ultimately precipitated the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986

Because the shuttle orbiter would be riding piggyback on the external tank and the need to prevent damage to the delicate thermal protection tiles the fiveengine variant of the SaturnShuttle would require the center engine to be shut down 45 to 50 seconds after launch while two of the outboard engines would have to be shut down prior to staging Once the SIC was jettisoned the three onboard highenergy Space Shuttle main engines would then propel the orbiter into LEO shutting down 65 minutes after ignition The external tank would then be jettisoned as on the actually flown shuttle configuration and the orbiter would then perform its mission

But because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President Richard Nixon to approve the shuttle program in 1972 NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the Titan III rocket instead of the SIC thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed

In 1994 enrollment in the school outgrew the capacity of its facilities at Faith Presbyterian As a result the schools lower grades K4 remained at Faith and the higher grades 58 the highest grade offered at the time moved to facilities at Watkinsville First Baptist Church WCAs first high school class graduated in the spring of 1999

The school completed the first phase of development at its present location a site in Oconee County in the fall of 1998 An additional expansion has been planned that would add a new gymnasium and bring the schools capacity to 500 students

The school enrolled 270 students across all grades for the 20112012 academic year

WCAs facilities include an administration building which also houses the library a lowerschool building which houses PreK through fifth grade an upperschool building with a gymnasium and a fitness center which houses the middle grades and Westminster High School a field house containing two class rooms and three athletic fields The gymnasium houses ten classrooms

Uniforms are required on four out of five days for middle through high school on casual Friday students can wear nontorn jeans and Tshirts A chapel is held every Thursday at separate times for K5 and 612 where all students sing and listen to a guest speaker

WCA is accredited by the Georgia Accrediting Commission and has a dual accreditation with the Southern Association of Independent Schools and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools

Northgate Mall San Rafael
Northgate Mall is a shopping mall located in San Rafael California north of the Golden Gate Bridge Its the largest of three shopping centers in San Rafael called Northgate It is managed by The Macerich Company It is the only enclosed regional shopping center in Marin County The malls anchors are Macys and Kohls with a vacant anchor last occupied by Sears It also contains a Century Theatres multiplex a food court and more than 90 specialty stores services and restaurants

The original anchor in the corner occupied by Macys was The Emporium which opened in 1964 When the rest of the mall opened in 1965 it had an openair design The mall was enclosed when it was renovated in 1987

MTR Properties Inc was the original owner Macerich bought the mall in 1985 before selling it to Merlone Geier Partners in 2017

On January 4 2018 Sears announced that its store at the mall will be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide The store closed in April 2018 Around the same time plans were announced that would transform the mall into a town center 

Macerich began renovating the mall in 2008 The proposed renovation has been controversial as housing advocates have pushed for inclusion of affordable housing in the project to replace the aging housing in the Canal Area while Macerich chose to proceed without triggering a fullscale environmental review

Relational dialectics
Relational dialectics is an interpersonal communication theory about close personal ties and relationships that highlights the tensions struggles and interplay between contrary tendencies The theory proposed respectively by Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery in 1988 defines communication patterns between relationship partners as the result of endemic dialectical tensions

Relationships are made in dialogue and they can be complicated and dialogue with similarities and differences are necessary Relational communication theories allow for opposing views or forces to come together in a reasonable way When making decisions desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are mentioned and lead to dialectical tensions Leslie A Baxter and Barbara M Montgomery exemplify these contradictory statements that arise from individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs such as opposites attract but birds of a feather flock together as well as twos company threes a crowd but the more the merrier This does not mean these opposing tensions are fundamentally troublesome for the relationship on the contrary they simply bring forward a discussion of the connection between two parties

The relational dialectic is an elaboration on Mikhail Bakhtins idea that life is an open monologue and humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications Baxter includes a list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that relationships are constantly changing and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention Although Baxters description of relational dialectics is thorough it is not exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways

Relational dialectics is the emotional and valuebased version of the philosophical dialectic It is rooted in the dynamism of the yin and yang Like the classic yin and yang the balance of emotional values in a relationship is constantly in motion and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite 

In the Western world the ideas of ying and yang link back to the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who argued that the world was in constant flux like fire with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process Mikhail Bakhtin a Russian scholar most known for his work in dialogism applied Marxist dialectic to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism He illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience For example he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference Bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces centripetal emotional forces tending towards unity and centrifugal emotional forces tending towards divergence Like the Yin and Yang Bakhtins forces have no ultimate resolution

Baxter took the deep structural analysis of Bakhtin and applied it to communication theory She found a TBangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated Later authors have added other axes

There are three main approaches to relational dialectics monologic dualistic and dialectic br

The first approach monologic approach frames contradictions as eitheror demonstrating that the contradictions are mutually exclusive or opposite of each other For example an individual can either like hot or cold weather They may not like not a mix of the weather conditions Monologic approach means as we move closer to one concept we move further away from the other br

The second approach dualistic approach frames contradictions as two separate entities showing that they are unrelated in nature When studying a relationship and one individual in the relationship is evaluated exclusive of his or her interaction with their partner then this is an example of dualistic approach br

The third approach the dialectic approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction bothand When two people are in a relationship one can desire to be open in the relationship exposing certain parts of his or her life with the other person At the same time that individual can also have a sense of selfprotection where they may not want to share everything about them with their partner Both of these feelings can exist within the individual at the same time

There are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics as well as four major assumptions Relational dialectics assumes that 1 relationships are not linear 2 relational life is characterized by change 3 contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life and 4 communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions

The four core concepts of relational dialectics include contradiction totality process and praxis

Contradictions are the core concept of relational dialectics It is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions A contradiction is formed whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent unity yet mutually negate one another negation For example in a relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance

Totality suggests that contradictions in a relationship are part of a unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation In other words the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other For example the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy  both work to condition and define the other

Process Relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social processes Movement activity and change are functional properties Rawlins1989 For example instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness In addition the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication Miller 2002 2005 

Praxis is a philosophical term for the concept of practical behavior or sometimes the experience of practicing In praxis the dialectic tensions are created and recreated through the active participation and interaction In other words the practical experience of having a relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and values of another As the relationship endures ones own needs and values become apparent Praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values dialectical tensions In turn the choices and actions themselves create recreate and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves

Research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships such as in marriage in the workplace etc Relational dialectics further includes the idea of Contextual Dialectics or rather the idea that every relationship exists within a specific place within a specific culture From there we also see the raise of public and privatereal and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what is seen on television in public life versus what is experienced in private lives Examples of this concept include the viewing of politicians as well as what is viewed on television shows According to West and Turner the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like Leave It to Beaver We receive an idealized message of what family life is like and then when we look at the families we live in we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life The tension between these two images forms this dialectic

According to the original relational dialectic model there were many core tensions opposing values in any relationship These are autonomy and connectedness favoritism and impartiality openness and closedness novelty and predictability instrumentality and affection and finally equality and inequality

Autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as a unique individual An example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete who wants to feel like heshe is a part of a team but also wanting to highlight hisher individual talents Favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as special For instance a professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades demonstrating favoritism Openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private When chatting with a boss about ones weekend there is the desire to be open however closedness is also at play as certain details are often left out because of the context Novelty and predictability suggest that there is a desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new When creating scheduled meetings for board members the predictability may lie in a fixed schedule however the novelty may be in scheduling a varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration Instrumentality and affection is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship An example of this would be being in a romantic relationship based on love and affection but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security Finally equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority A female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments 

According to the theory while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness certainty and openness in our relationships the communication is not a straight path towards these goals Conflicts often produce the exact opposites

The table above shows typical dialectical tensions experienced by relational partners based on research done by Baxter and Montgomery showing contrasting efforts in two different ways The column that displays examples of Internal Dialect shows ongoing tensions played out within a relationship The column that displays examples of External Dialect shows ongoing tensions between a couple and their community

Integrationseparation is a class of relational dialectics that includes connectionautonomy inclusionseclusion and intimacyindependence Some individual autonomy must be given up to connect to others

Stabilitychange is a class of relational dialectics that includes certaintyuncertainty conventionallyuniqueness predictabilitysurprise and routinenovelty Things must be consistent but not mundane There must be a balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep a relationship

Expressionnonexpression is a class of relational dialectics that includes opennessclosedness revelationconcealment candorsecrecy and transparencyprivacy In a relationship it is important to keep some things between the two parties while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about

According to Michaela Meyer relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes a continual maintenance and repair of these tensions As a result relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships Extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship Through studies of romantic relationships long distance relationships friendships and family relationships researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships

According to Marsha Linehan founder of DBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy some people have great difficulty resolving the dialectic tensions that arise in relationships Many people with personality disorders potentially caused or made worse by dysfunctional upbringing especially Borderline Personality Disorder BPD and some others perpetually vascilate between the poles of the dialectic conflict with resulting instability causing problems in living that are not mediated by other therapy modalities In DBTs biosocial theory some people have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior 

A study of 25 heterosexual married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses Larry Erbert found that the Openness v Closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants Research conducted by Baxter and Montgomery confirmed this finding and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships


Research has been conducted to examine the autonomyconnection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships In Erin Sahlestein and Tim Duns study they found that participants joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction Both antagonistic and nonantagonistic struggles were evident in these data Furthermore the study discovered that while normally breakups are retroactively studied the autonomyconnection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as a move from connection to autonomy

A study measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples revealed that while samesex couples experience similar challenges that oppositesex partners experience there are unique challenges that arise to these samesex couples These unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship

In a study that focused on dialectics in second marriages six tensions unique to remarriages emerged

Three tensions related to the remarried dyad


Three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks


Based on research by Sahlstein the uncertainty v certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in longdistance relationships Her work exposed uncertainty v certainty as a competing yet complementary need In interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships contradictions emerged For example couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain a level of spontaneity Within this three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged

William Rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to friendships The tension of instrumentality v affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship Within friendships importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for real friendships opposed to instrumentality for fake friendships Aristotles friendship of virtue notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point The dichotomy of instrumentality v affection cannot be ignored within friendships as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends This interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships While this remains true the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality v affection is applied

In the workplace

Blended Relationships are close friends that are a part of the same work environment Dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations It is not necessary however to have a friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose
 Sibling relationships 

Relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood As one sibling begins a new phase of life this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in hisher new lifestyle along with a new geographic separation both of which result in a change in communication As the newly absent sibling begins a new lifestyle beyond hisher home the preexisting sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions

In a study conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition all participants acknowledged that moving away from their siblings resulted in a discursive struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship Two specific discursive struggles were identified

While participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions 8 of the 19 participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brothers andor sisters

In a study focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchildstepparent relationship three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants

In another study researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents The participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while at the same time they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents The main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomyconnection dialectic stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents However these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another While the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening at the same time they also wanted to be protected resulting in a second dialectic of controlrestraint Through this study the researchers believe that opennesscloseness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships

One study focused on the relationship and communication between collegeaged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents found two underlying contradictions parenting and not parenting and openness and closeness Many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were Participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parents lack of familiarity with the childs everyday life

Relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care specifically endoflife care providing a system for caregiver communication that contains tensions and challenges The quality of the endoflife journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed Relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patientsfamily members during the process of endoflife care

When making choices about endoflife medical care family members friends or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden Decisionmakers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decisionmaking Family members in charge of making endoflife decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go recognizing the need to let a patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep a loved one alive

In a study that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the Maori culture during the endoflife journey it was found that despite the cultures focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony four communication tensions existed between caregivers family and friends and patients autonomy and connection conflict and connection isolation and connection and balancing the needs of self and other

The human grieving process is marked by relational dialectics After the death of a child bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their childs permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child Bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive

One study aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses found two discursive contradictions family members wishes vs patients wishes and emotionality vs rationality Through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of a loved one researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members patients and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go Participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of a loved one and with that experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality

Dialectical contradictions have also been found among parents who have lost a child One study found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of a child opennesscloseness and presenceabsence Parents experienced opennesscloseness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss yet they perceived the outcome as risky especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on Participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation When dealing with the presenceabsence dialectic bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child and the physical absence of the child Participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child the physical absence of the child was deeply felt However when people chose to remember the deceased child the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child

Understanding Autistic Communication

As relational dialects aim is to analyse competence during interaction it can suggest an approach to researching on communication competence among people which are with autism spectrum disorders Applying relational dialects theory to studying interactions of autistic individuals starts from approaching autistic individual as an actor during the interaction and deeming competence a result of the interaction This approach can delve into how social contexts expectations and roles contribute to the autistics competent communication The investigation of dialects includes integrationseparation expressionprivacy and stabilitychange enhance the understanding of the communication between people with autism spectrum disorders

Dialogue is typically a conversation between two or more people These conversations are what constitute relationships as communication is the very foundation of any relationship According to Cools the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism 1 the self and the other situated in contradictory forces 2 unfinalizability 3 the chronotope and the carnivalesque and 4 heteroglossia and utterance Similarity in dialogue the following components are the most important constitutive dialogue utterance chains dialectical flux aesthetic moment and critical sensibility

Constitutive dialogue

While some theorists along with Baxter may argue that communication is simply a feature in a relationship examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains a relationship instead According to Baxter a constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines or constructs the social world including our selves and our personal relationships From a constitutive perspective then persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication instead communication constitutes these phenomena When initial researchers studied relationships they found that similarities backgrounds and interests are usually what hold people together while selfdisclosure is the root of these components Dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue

Utterance chains

To understand utterance chains we must know that an utterance is what a person says in one turn of a conversation When utterances are linked to competing discourses they are considered utterance chains Baxter believes that there are four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard These are cultural ideologies relational history nonyet spoken response of partner or utterance and normative evaluation of third party to utterance Baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance we must also understand the discourse She posits in the broadest sense a discourse is a cultural system of meaning that circulates among a groups members and which makes our talk sensical for example in the United States the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as I need to find myself first before I commit to a serious relationship with another person

Dialectical flux

A dialectical flux is the unpredictable unfinalizable indeterminate nature of personal relationships Relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions Spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that Baxter and Montgomery have established to respond to this complexity Spiraling inversion is generally a nowin situation a struggle between two different thought processes For example if you were to do something your parents did not approve of you could lie about it but your parents might yell at you for lying And on the other hand you could tell them upfront and they could be completely quiet in shock Segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in a relationship that must be altered depending on the situation For example if you were working at your fathers shop as a parttime job he would be considered your father AND your boss This could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles

Aesthetic moment

Aesthetic moments are brief incidents in a relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue There is a temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue It is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships such as a first kiss or a reciting of wedding vows but these moments can be experienced by anyone

Critical sensibility

According to Griffin critical sensibility is an obligation to critique dominant voices especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints a responsibility to advocate for those who are muted This means that both sides of a dialogue are equal to one another No one person is more powerful or dominant than the other and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering This does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in Utterance Chains

When communicating we must understand that morals do not apply for all people Sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to There are several times where most people would justify a white lie or a lie that causes no harm For instance if your mother was in the hospital you could tell her she still looked beautiful even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better Other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have a positive or negative outcome are called consequential ethics According to Sissela Bok lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations Bok believes in the principle of veracity which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight Ethics plays a major role in the study of interpersonal communication particularly relational dialectics In an area where contradictions seem like the norm it is even more important to share the truth Incorporating varying and often times opposite view points is critical because communication is grounded in human nature which forces ethics

According to theorist Leslie Baxter there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory Baxter claims that her work has been too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties and claims that the theory needs a firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties Naturally occurring talk between relating parties could be qualitative work utilizing the observation method of relating parties or small groups Nonparticipative or participative observation would be appropriate for continued study of relational dialectics theory Baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between two voices Baxter posits that relational dialectics opposite infers binary opposites when many discourses can be competing at once Lastly Baxter shares that future research should focus on discourse through time such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over a longer period of time The latter would take significant time so it would be studies that incorporate earlier works compared to more recent work

WVAR first went on the air on November 16 1957 and first broadcast at 1280 AM under the call letters WMNF The original owner was Royal Broadcasting Company of which Herman Dotson served as president and Art Grunewald as general manager Studios were located along Cemetery Road in Richwood By 1959 the call letters were changed to WVAR as they remain today

On January 1 1965 WVAR was sold to R  S Broadcasting Carl Gainer was the new company president and Virgil Graves became General Manager In 1968 WVAR moved from its dial position of 1280kHz to 600kHz The station retained its daytimeonly broadcast hours and output power of 1000 watts

In 1991 WVAR moved its studios and offices to 713 Main Street in Summersville but would maintain a local presence in Richwood at 2 Rhododendron Drive formerly known as Cemetery Road On December 24 1996 after more than 30 years of ownership WVAR was sold by R  S Broadcasting to J  K Broadcasting The ownership change also resulted in the pairing of an FM sister station WAFD which had gone on the air earlier that year with a southern and country gospel format

In midFebruary 2003 an ice storm that ravaged the southern part of West Virginia toppled the WVAR broadcasting antenna atop Hinkle Mountain which overlooks Richwood In the following summer the station and its owner raised funds to erect a new antenna The station was closed with a dark license while funds were sought to replace it

On March 13 2007 J  K Broadcasting Inc sold WVAR to Summit Media Broadcasting LLC for 124 million in a transaction that included sister FM station WAFD in Webster Springs Summit Media also owns WDBSFM and WSGBAM Studios were moved to 202 Back Fork Street in Webster Springs

On May 15 2007 WVAR dropped its country format and began simulcasting sister WSGBAMs oldies format as The Mighty 1490 That October Summit Media filed an application with the FCC to waive main studio requirements for WVAR which would allow onair operations to be colocated with WSGB and other stations in Summit Medias ownership group

Two months later another application was filed informing the FCC that Summit Media had taken the station silent due to Summit Medias inability to successfully meet FCCrequired staffing needs at the Webster Springs studio The FCC granted the application to keep the station silent in January 2008 until granting permission for the studio waiver later that year However Summit Media kept the station silent for another year due to technical renovations being delayed due to the lack of available workforce

In November 2009 Summit Media filed an application to rebroadcast WVARs signal over FM translator W251AY licensed to Birch River The translator licensed to operate at 981 mHz broadcasts at 250 watts at a height of 256 m above average terrain The translator which has been on the air since 2004 had been previously used to rebroadcast the signal of sister FM station WDBS

Oboe Concerto Marcello
The Oboe Concerto in Dminor SD935 is an early 18thcentury concerto for oboe strings and continuo attributed to the Venetian composer Alessandro Marcello The earliest extant manuscript containing Johann Sebastian Bachs solo keyboard arrangement of the concerto BWV974 dates from around 1715 As a concerto for oboe strings and continuo its oldest extant sources date from 1717 that year it was printed in Amsterdam and a Cminor variant of the concerto SZ799 was written down

Bachs keyboard version was published as an arrangement of a concerto by Antonio Vivaldi in the 19th century In 1923 the Cminor version of the oboe concerto was published as a composition by Benedetto Marcello Alessandros brother In the second half of the 20th century several publications indicated Alessandro again as the composer of the piece as it had been in its early 18thcentury print and the oboe concerto was again published in its Dminor version

As well oboe concerto versions and versions based on Bachs arrangement kept repertoire in the 20th and 21st century

The Concerto in Dminor SD935 was published by Jeanne Roger in Amsterdam in 1717 as a Concerto a Cinque concerto in five parts for oboe soloist strings two violin and one viola parts and continuo composed by Alessandro Marcello No publication date appears in the print although the year of publication is depending on author sometimes given as ca 17141717 or 1716 it can be inferred from the consecutive testaments of the publishers father Estienne Roger and from the sequence of publication numbers The publication presents the melody lines unadorned that is it is left to the performing musician to embellish melodies with ornaments such as trills mordents and grace notes Alessandro Marcello published most of his works under a pseudonym Eterio Stinfalico the oboe concerto publication was an exception in that sense as it used his real name

In his Weimar period 170817 Johann Sebastian Bach arranged several concertos by Venetian composers most of them by Antonio Vivaldi for solo keyboard In July 1713 Prince Johann Ernst returned to Weimar from the Netherlands with several compositions by Italian masters Vivaldis Op3 Lestro Armonico had been published in Amsterdam in 1711 and there is little doubt that the Prince brought this edition containing twelve concertos to Weimar in 1713 as Bach apparently used this print for five of his solo keyboard arrangements The Prince who also composed Italianate concertos presumably encouraged Bach to produce solo keyboard arrangements of such works As the Prince left Weimar in July 1714 it is estimated that most of Bachs solo keyboard arrangements of Italian and Italianate concertos originated in the period from July 1713 to July 1714 That is at least those arrangements that could be performed on a harpsichord without pedalboard while the Weimar court organ which would be needed for arrangements including pedals such as BWV 592597 would have been unavailable for undergoing repairs in this period

Bachs manualiter arrangement BWV974 of the Marcello concerto was apparently not based on the Amsterdam edition but must have been based on a lost manuscript version of the concerto that circulated before it was printed The July 1713 to July 1714 timeframe may fit for the production of the arrangement of this concerto although an earlier or later date is possible too Bachs autograph of the solo keyboard arrangement is lost but the arrangement was copied around 1715 by Bachs second cousin Johann Bernhard as the third item in a manuscript containing 12 of Johann Sebastians keyboard transcriptions of Italian and Italianate concertos In 1739 Johann Bernhards son Johann Ernst wrote a title page for this collection suggesting that the collection contained Vivaldi arrangements for organ exclusively He may have intended this title page for the first concerto in the collection only which was indeed an arrangement of a Vivaldi concerto but an unknown hand later added the number XII before the title thus causing the misunderstanding that all 12 were Vivaldi arrangements Another copy of Bachs arrangement indicates Marcello without first name as the composer of the original work and JS Bach as the arranger That copy specifying harpsichord as the intended instrument for the arrangement originated after Johann Bernhards but may have been copied from an earlier stage of Bachs arrangement Another manuscript containing Bachs arrangement of Marcellos oboe concerto indicated JSB as composer on the title page without mentioning an earlier model or its composer for the composition

The ornamentation as indicated in Bachs keyboard version of the concerto works well on harpsichord but is less suitable for performance on an early 18thcentury oboe Nonetheless Bachs ornamentation has been used for 20thcentury publications of the oboe concerto  the ornamentation causes fewer problems when performed on a modern oboe Editions of the Dminor version of the oboe concerto with an ornamentation which is better in line with the possibilities of a baroque oboe have been proposed since the late 20th century

Another transcription of the concerto as concerto a 5 for oboe strings and continuo in Cminor is found in a 1717 manuscript The type of errors in this manuscript seems to suggest that the transposition from Dminor to Cminor may have been produced by its scribes while copying This manuscript writes the composers name as Marcello without specifying a first name as Alessandros brother Benedetto was far better known as a composer by the name Marcello later generations would interpret the title of the manuscript as referring to the better known of the Marcello composers

The piece has three movements

The concerto survives in different printed and manuscript versions one of these in C minor

The concerto has also been recorded played on a piccolo trumpet  a notoriously challenging transcription due to the breath control and tight embouchure required for its sustained passages in the higher register

FrankTamm formula
The FrankTamm formula yields the amount of Cherenkov radiation emitted on a given frequency as a charged particle moves through a medium at superluminal velocity It is named for Russian physicists Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm who developed the theory of the Cherenkov effect in 1937 for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1958

When a charged particle moves faster than the phase speed of light in a medium electrons interacting with the particle can emit coherent photons while conserving energy and momentum This process can be viewed as a decay See Cherenkov radiation and nonradiation condition for an explanation of this effect

The energy formula1 emitted per unit length travelled by the particle per unit of frequency formula2 is

provided that formula4 Here formula5 and formula6 are the frequencydependent permeability and index of refraction of the medium respectively formula7 is the electric charge of the particle formula8 is the speed of the particle and formula9 is the speed of light in vacuum

Cherenkov radiation does not have characteristic spectral peaks as typical for fluorescence or emission spectra The relative intensity of one frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency That is higher frequencies shorter wavelengths are more intense in Cherenkov radiation This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue In fact most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum

The total amount of energy radiated per unit length is

This integral is done over the frequencies formula11 for which the particles speed formula8 is greater than speed of light of the media formula13 The integral is convergent finite because at high frequencies the refractive index becomes less than unity and for extremely high frequencies it becomes unity

Consider a charged particle moving relativistically along formula14axis in a medium with refraction index formula15 with a constant velocity formula16 Start with Maxwells equations in Gaussian units in the wave form and take the Fourier transformation

formula17

formula18

For a charge moving with velocity formula8 the density and charge density can be expressed as formula20 and formula21 taking the Fourier transformation gives

formula22 

formula23

Substituting this density and charge current into the wave equation we can solve for the Fourierform potentials

formula24 and formula25

Using the definition of the electromagnetic fields in terms of potentials we then have the Fourierform of the electric and magnetic field

formula26 and formula27

To find the radiated energy we consider electric field as a function of frequency at some perpendicular distance from the particle trajectory say at formula28 where formula29 is the impact parameter It is given by the inverse Fourier transform

formula30

First we compute formula14component formula32 of the electric field parallel to formula33

formula34

For brevity we define formula35 Breaking the integral apart into formula36 the formula37 integral can immediately be integrated by the definition of the Dirac Delta

formula38

The integral over formula39 has the value formula40 giving

formula41

The last integral over formula42 is in the form of a modified Macdonald Bessel function giving the evaluated parallel component in the form

formula43

One can follow a similar pattern of calculation for the other fields components arriving at

formula44 and formula45

We can now consider the radiated energy formula1 per particle traversed distance formula47 It can be expressed through the electromagnetic energy flow formula48 through the surface of an infinite cylinder of radius formula49 around the path of the moving particle which is given by the integral of the Poynting vector formula50 over the cylinder surface

formula51

The integral over formula52 at one instant of time is equal to the integral at one point over all time Using formula53

formula54

Converting this to the frequency domain

formula55

To go into the domain of Cherenkov radiation we now consider perpendicular distance formula29 much greater than atomic distances in a medium that is formula57 With this assumption we can expand the Bessel functions into their asymptotic form

formula58

formula59 and formula60

Thus

formula61

If formula62 has a positive real part usually true the exponential will cause the expression to vanish rapidly at large distances meaning all the energy is deposited near the path However this isnt true when formula63 is purely imaginary  this instead causes the exponential to become 1 and then is independent of formula49 meaning some of the energy escapes to infinity as radiation  this is Cherenkov radiation

formula63 is purely imaginary if formula66 is real and formula67 That is when formula66 is real Cherenkov radiation has the condition that formula69 This is the statement that the speed of the particle much be larger than the phase velocity of electromagnetic fields in the medium at frequency formula11 in order to have Cherenkov radiation With this purely imaginary formula63 condition formula72 and the integral can be simplified to

formula73

This is the FrankTamm equation in Gaussian units This derivation follows Jackson 3rd Edition

Hughes v Lord Advocate
The cases main significance is that after the shift within the common law of negligence from strict liability to a reasonable standard of care this case advocated a middle way namely 
This idea was neither developed nor expanded upon and only one year later the claimant in Doughty v Turner Manufacturing obtained no remedy via this middle way However the case was followed in subsequent cases on occupiers liability

One evening in November 1958 two boys aged 8 and 10 were walking down Russell Road Edinburgh where some Post Office workers were repairing cables under the street The men had opened a manhole and had erected a weather tent over it with an access ladder inside From midafternoon onwards the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps The workmen left around 5pm for a tea break nearby before leaving they withdrew the ladder leaving it outside the tent

While the workmen were out the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment They picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent They took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole after which they safely climbed out again The younger boy tripped over the lamp which fell into the manhole and broke The paraffin leaked and vaporised causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet The impact of the blast caused the 8year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries

The question arose whether the Post Office workers had been negligent in leaving the site unattended with the lamps burning Under Scots law they owed a duty of reasonable care to prevent the site becoming an allurement for the boys had they discharged this duty On the other hand the children were trespasser and possibly contributorily negligence A crucial issue was the likelihood or foreseeability of the presence of children on Russell Road and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries was of different type than that could have been foreseeable

The court of first instance the First Division of the Court of Session limited the liability of the Post Office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable The defence had argued that the boys were not only trespassers but also contributorily negligeny but the court responded that the Post Office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support a claim of trespass and taking into consideration the youth of the boy it was agreed that he was NOT contributorily negligence and these points were dropped on appeal to the House of Lords

Lord Jenkins addressed the duty of issue of care established by Lord Atkin in Donoghue v Stevenson saying the Post Office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting a source of danger to passerby  It was therefore their duty that such passerby neighbour in the language of Donoghue v Stevenson were so far as reasonably practicable protected from the various obstacles or allurements which the workmen had brought to the site It is clear that the safety precautions taken by the Post Office did not in this instance measure up to Lord Atkins test

Lord Morris stated that exercising an ordinary and certainly not an overexacting degree of prevention the workmen should have decided when the teabreak came that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care

In both the First Division and in the House of Lords the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on Russell Road a quiet road some four hundred yards away from any houses Lord Morris opined following the judgement of Lord Ordinary that if of course there was no likelihood that children might appear different considerations would apply But children did appear and I find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the Lord Ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated

Lord Guest declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this Lord Guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children and that that  the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by a lamp were such that a reasonable man would not have ignored them

It was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was a result of paraffin leaking from the lamp According to Lord Reid the boys injuries from burns was foreseeable Although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected this was no defence However if the injury were of a different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability

Lord Reid continued that as the cause of the accident  the explosion from paraffin lamp  was known it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source rather than the fault of respondent Lord Reid concluded that the accident in question was but a variant of foreseeable and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner

Lord Jenkins agreed finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded

Lord Morris agreed saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of a higher degree but was of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable He said the respondent should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way in which the boy might play with the equipment or the way in which he might get hurt Allowing the appeal Lord Morris said there was a duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didnt envisage the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident

Lord Guest pointed out that for making a coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable but only that the type of accident caused was of a foreseeable type He was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion to Lord Guest it was a nonessential element He gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was a reasonable foreseeable event The lower courts had already concluded these events as a reasonable foreseeable event but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event Lord Guest argued this as a fallacious claim Lord Guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by Post Office employees who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident

Lord Pearce cited the case of The Wagon Mound which held that a person is not liable if the accident is of a different type than the type which was foreseen by the person It would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place

In sum all the judges allowed the boys appeal The decision was followed in Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council

For a similar case arising under US law see Palsgraf v Long Island Railroad a case which had been influential upon the court in Donoghue v Stevenson

TalaMaddale
TalaMaddale is an ancient form of performance dialogue or debate performance in Southern India in the coastal Malnad regions of Karnataka and Kerala The plot and content of the conversation is drawn from popular mythology but the performance mainly consists of an impromptu debate between characters involving sarcasm puns philosophy positions and humour The main plot is sung from the same oral texts used for the yakshgana form of dance drama Performers claim that this was a more intellectual rendition of the dance during the monsoon season

The art form is popular in Uttara Kannada Dakshina Kannada Udupi and Shimoga districts of Karnataka and Kasaragod district of Kerala It is a derived form of Yakshaganaa classical dance or musical form of art from the same region

A typical TalaMaddale show consists of veteran artists sitting in a circular fashion along with a Bhagavata the singer with Tala or pair of small hand cymbals and a Maddale a type of drum player Artists play the roles of characters in stories typically from Ramayana Mahabharata and other puranas Some consider the as a good presentation of oratorial skills

Artists are normally well versed with the Hindu epics and puranas Kannada language is the normal medium of communication TalaMaddale performances are mostly held during the night the traditional reason being that in ancient times people finished their work by this time and assembled in temples to watch Tala Maddale It is organized by either hobbyists who are interested in the art at their houses or as a public event in villages and towns

As is common in many Indian art forms A Tala Maddale performance is commenced with a puja to Lord Ganesh the Hindu God of knowledge learning and art with a prayer song by Bhagavatha Usually this song is Gajamukhadavage ganapage This tends to be followed by a combination of pre scripted as well as ex tempore debates between the artists Hence while the average length of a performance is about three hours it can extend depending upon the debate Due to the latter artists are expected to be well versed with the subject matter too In ancient times TalaMaddale performances often took the form of allnight performances from 7 pm right up to 6 am

Subjects of Tala Maddale performances normally focus on episodes from the Hindu epics of Bhagavata and Puranas However episodes have also been created on other more current issues some of which include the Second World War the Tashkent Agreement the Indian freedom struggle Swarajya Vijaya and computerisation Ganakasura Kalaga

Some of the popular Tala maddale artists are Sheni Gopala Krishna Bhat Kerekai Krishna Bhat Kerekai Umakant Bhat Polali Shankaranarayana Shastri Shankaranarayana Samaga Matti Subba Rao Vasudeva Samaga Prabhakara Joshi MV Hegde Kumble Sundar Rao ML Samaga Padekallu Vishnu Bhat Sadashiva Alva Talapady Appu Nayak Athrady Ramana Acharya and Prashanth Belur Artha vaibhava or the grandeur of dialogues tends to be a highlight of these performances relished by the rasikas audience

In August 2016 the story of the Indian Freedom Struggle Swarajya Vijaya was enacted in Tala Maddale in the outer yard of the Sri Ananteshwara Temple at Rajangana Karnataka The episode prasanga had been written by MV Hegde A similar Tala Maddale performance related to the Indian freedom struggle had been held at this very place on 14 August 1947 when India achieved freedom from British Colonial powers

Tom Hickathrift
Tom Hickathrift or sometimes Jack Hickathrift is a legendary figure of East Anglian English folklore  a character similar to Jack the Giant Killer He famously battled a giant and is sometimes said to be a giant himself though normally he is just represented as possessing giantlike strength

Various stories of his exploits have grown up In one version he is fabled to have been a simple labourer at the time of the Norman Conquest and to have killed a giant in the marsh at Tilney Norfolk armed only with an axletree stuck into a cartwheel When his makeshift weapon broke he grabbed a lusty rawboned miller and used him as a weapon instead This exploit earned him the governorship of Thanet At the church in Walpole St Peter there is a dent in the ground where it is said a cannonball landed after he threw it to scare away the devil in this version Tom is a giant

In the fairy tale as told by Joseph Jacobs Tom lived in marsh of the Isle of Ely and although initially lazy and gluttonous he was prodigiously tall and it soon became apparent that he had the strength of twenty men Various proofs of his strength are given he carried twenty hundredweight of straw and a tree as if they weighed nothing kicked a football so far that nobody could find it and turned the tables on four men who tried to rob him He eventually got a job carting beer in Wisbech but the long journey tired him so one day he cut across the land of the Wisbech Giant The giant took this badly and fetched his club to beat Tom but at this point Tom took the axletree and cartwheel and fought the giant After a furious battle the giant was killed Tom took his land and was from then on held in esteem by the people of the area

Jacobs cites his source as the chapbook in the Pepysian Library from around 1660 edited by G L Gomme Gommes introduction states that there was evidence that an axletree and cartwheel had figured on a stone tomb in Tilney churchyard and local accounts associated these with a man named Hickifric who had withstood the tyranny of the lord of the manor

It has been suggested that he echoes the Norse god Thor AngloSaxon unor they were both known for fighting giants ate prodigiously and used a hammerlike weapon there is even a suggestion that the miller and Thors hammer Mjolnir come from the same source

He is mentioned in Laurence Sternes Tristram Shandy and Lavengro by George Borrow although Borrow places his exploits as far north as Lincolnshire The elaborate moulded plasterwork pargeting decorating the Old Sun Inn in Saffron Walden Essex features his battle against the Wisbech Giant

A character named Hiccafrith based on Tom appears in Marcus Pitcaithlys Hereward trilogy

Washington Memorial Chapel
Washington Memorial Chapel  located on Pennsylvania Route 23 in Valley Forge National Historical Park  is both a national memorial dedicated to General George Washington and an active Episcopal parish in Valley Forge Pennsylvania The church was inspired by a sermon preached by Anglican ministerReverend Dr W Herbert Burk founder and first rector of the parish The building was designed by architect Milton B Medary It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 1 2017 and is undergoing an active restoration campaign

Reverend Burk was rector of an Episcopal church in nearby Norristown The money for the chapel was raised in small increments nickels and dimes and its stone walls were built a few feet at a time In the religious and patriotic zeal of the day Dr Burk was active in trying to preserve Valley Forge and in the establishment of the Valley Forge Museum of American History the predecessor to the Valley Forge Historical Society

A previous attempt to build a memorial church at Valley Forge had been launched in 1885 by Baptist minister James M Guthrie who raised funds and began building before running out of funds

On June 19 1903 the 125th anniversary of the evacuation of the Continental Army from Valley Forge the cornerstone was laid on property donated by the I Heston Todd family A small woodframed building nearby preceded the present structure Following President Theodore Roosevelts visit to the site and address in 1904 the original wooden building was named the Theodore Roosevelt Chapel It was demolished after completion of the present chapel

The Chapels exterior was completed in 1917 and its interior in 1921 It serves as a wayside chapel to those who visit Valley Forge National Historical Park and is open to the public

Noted ironsmith Samuel Yellin produced the wrought iron gates hardware and locks He was one of many artisans to produce sculptures stonework stained glass and metal work The interior woodwork was supplied by BelgianAmerican cabinetmaker Edward Maene 18521931

From the visitors perspective the Chapel with its central location can appear to be a part of the park However the Chapel and surrounding property belong to the Episcopal Church Across Valley Forge Park Road formerly Port Kennedy Road standing opposite from the Chapel is the builders model of the Washington Monument This obelisk marks the grave of Lieutenant John Waterman The original Waterman gravestone had been on display in the visitors center museum The Bell Tower houses the DAR Patriot Rolls listing those that served in the Revolutionary War and the Chapel grounds hosted the World of Scouting Museum until ca 2013

The National Patriots Bell Tower was a later addition to the Chapel and houses its carillon The tower was built entirely with funds raised by members of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution DAR over a period of more than a decade Construction began in 1941 but was suspended due to World War II and restarted in 1949 The bell tower was completed and dedicated in 1953

The Justice Bell Womens Liberty Bell is on permanent display in the bell tower chamber It was forged in 1915 as a nearly identical replica of the Liberty Bell and became an instrumental symbol of the Womens Suffrage movement In 1920 after touring many parts of the country to promote the passing of the 19 Amendment the bell was stored on the grounds of Valley Forge National Park before being permanently moved to the bell tower chamber in 1943

The bell tower contains a traditional carillon with a keyboard of 58 bells The first 14 bells from the Meneely Bell Foundry were installed in a temporary wooden tower in 1926 and the number of bells expanded over the course of three decades Fiftysix bells were installed in the bell tower in 1953 and expanded to 58 bells in 1963 with two bells from the Fonderie Paccard in France

The bell tower is played regularly by a resident carilloneur Concerts both formal and informal are held throughout the year and are open to the public

Lake Lena Minnesota
Lake Lena is an unincorporated community and Native American village in Ogema Township Pine County Minnesota United States located along the Lower Tamarack River It currently is the administrative center for the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III

Lake Lena is located 25 miles east of Hinckley and 7 miles westnorthwest of Danbury Wisconsin Lake Lena is 24 miles eastsoutheast of Sandstone

Grace Lake Road Pine County 173 serves as a main route in the community State Highway 48 MN 48 is nearby

Its name in the Ojibwe language is Aazhoomog meaning Crossroads in reference to being at the former crossroad of the northsouth trail connecting Bikoganaagan Danbury via the former Agaming OutflowLower Tamarack River Village and the former Gibaakwaiganing Tozer Camplower Upper Tamarack River Village with the eastwest trail connecting Mooningwanekaaning La Pointe via Namekaawaiganing Gordon with Gaazhiigwanaabikokaag Hinckley

Before the arrival of the Dakota Sioux the area about Lake Lena was inhabited by the Cheyenne Fox and HoChunk with migratory Gros Ventre Mandwe and Menominee peoples The Lake Lena area served as a place abundant with food in the heart of the Folle Avoine Region with Wild Rice and Sturgeon In addition the Lake Lena Village was located along the site of the annual Bear migratory path

With the arrival of the Dakota Sioux only the Fox remained as permanent residents of the region However occasional Cheyenne HoChunk and Menominee peoples still came to the area for the Wild Rice The Santee Sioux maintained a trade network routes offered by the St Croix River and the series of trails connecting the Lake Lena Village with Lake Superior Mississippi River headwaters and other major upper Mississippi River destinations Red Cedar River and Chippewa River With the arrival of the Ojibwe from the cultural center in La Pointe the area about the upper St Croix River became a contested place Though the Fox were permanently pushed out of the area the Dakota and Ojibwe eventually came to peace and lived sidebyside

After the Ojibwe had gained control of the upper St Croix River valley the Lake Lena area became one of many network of trade villages However in the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien the United States formally drew the boundaries separating the Dakota and the Ojibwe For the Lake Lena and other Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe already intertwined with the Dakota this posed a problem With agreements the more southern Dakota north of the Prairie du Chien Line moved south of the line with the more northern Dakota north of the line were adopted as Ojibwe and became the Wolf Totem Meanwhile many of the Ojibwe located south of the line were adopted into the Mdewakanton By maintaining the trade network but with a different tribal association Aazhoomog transitioned from a DakotaOjibwe village to a fully Ojibwe village The Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe of the upper St Croix River valley became one of the signatories to the 1837 Treaty of St Peters and the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe The 1837 treaty dubbed the White Pine Treaty brought an influx of lumber industry After the Sandy Lake Tragedy the United States encouraged the consolidation of the Ojibwe onto Indian Reservations rather than removing them west of the Mississippi River In the treaty negotiations for the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe St Croix Chippewa realized that a central reservation would be created immediately south of the Upper St Croix Lake near Solon Springs Wisconsin Due to strong lumber interests the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe knew the removal to a reservation would mean eventual loss of hunting fishing and gathering rights promised the 1837 and 1842 treaties Upon this realization the St Croix Chippewa refuted all provisions of the treaty negotiations and did not sign the 1854 treaty However by not signing the treaty the St Croix Chippewa lost their federal recognition However even as unrecognized Indian Tribe the St Croix Chippewa was still eligible to receive their annuities Depending on the time and location peoples of St Croix Chippewa went to either the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation Eventually the Lake Lena Village through the lumber operations in the region went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation

After the loss of federal recognition of the St Croix Chippewa the population of the Aazhoomog slowly declined For their annuity payment the people of Aazhoomog were sent to either the Lake Mille Lacs Indian Reservation or the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation Eventually the Aazhoomog Village through the lumber operations in the region went to the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation more often than to the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation Aazhoomogs English name Lake Lena came about during this time named after Mrs Lena Thayer who operated a post office until the early 1920s Beginning in 1922 under the authority of the Consolidated Chippewa Agency Lake Lena Village began receiving services independent of the Mille Lacs Indians or the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians In 1936 when Minnesota Chippewa Tribe was created under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe was further divided between those located in Minnesota and those located in Wisconsin

When the contemporary Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe was organized its charter included the Mille Lacs Indians Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa and the St Croix Band of Chippewa Indians This was praised in the Lake Lena Village for regaining Federal recognition after 85 years of not having Federal recognition though it was not independent Federal recognition However this posed a major problem for the Manoominikeshiinyag Ojibwe on the Wisconsin side especially for those living about Danbury Wisconsin since the charter also included them yet they were not eligible to receive services from the Consolidated Chippewa Agency of Minnesota The remaining St Croix Chippewa on the Wisconsin side in order to maintain cohesion of the unrecognized tribe sought and gained Federal recognition independent of both the Mille Lacs and Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservations becoming the contemporary St Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin

Today the Aazhoomog village houses the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation District III Government Services and Community Center and the Aazhoomog Clinic of the NeIaShing Clinic System The United States Postal Service places Aazhoomog under Sandstone Minnesota though a separate community of Asinikaaning exists The Lake Lena Village relies on the nearby Swiss Township fire department for fire emergencies Near the village the Mille Lacs Band operates the Crossroads Marathon gas station convenience store and laundromat

Grislidis
Grislidis is an opera described as a conte lyrique in three acts and a prologue by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Armand Silvestre and Eugne Morand It is based on the play by the same authors first performed at the ComdieFranaise on 15 May 1891 which is drawn from the medieval tale of patient Grissil The story is set in 14th century Provence and concerns the shepherdess Grislidis and a number of attempts by the Devil to lure her into infidelity Grislidis loyalty to her husband The Marquis is strong however and the devil is vanquished

Massenet began composition in 1894 completing it by the end of that year but revising it in the autumn 1898 prior to discussing a potential production with Albert Carr It was first performed at the OpraComique in Paris on 20 November 1901 with Lucienne Brval in the title role The piece achieved 50 performances in the first six months at the OpraComique was withdrawn from the repertory in 1906 and in a halfcentury had been seen there 73 times 

According to Rodney Milnes Grislidis on its own terms is one of Massenets most successful operas and does not deserve neglect the action moves swiftly the instrumentation is economic and delicate and the melodies unconstrained with a skilful mixture of comedy and sentiment and a vocally rewarding title role

The opera was staged in Nice Algiers Brussels and Milan in 1902 in Marseille in 1903 and 1950 and at the Paris Opra in 1922 Although not part of the current operatic repertoire more recently it has been seen in Wexford 1982 Strasbourg and Lige 1986 and SaintEtienne 1992 in concert

Evening time in the forest
The shepherd Alain sings of his love for Grislidis The Marquis out hunting sees her is overwhelmed and proposes marriage which she accepts to the despair of Alain
Four years later

Grislidis has a son and as the Marquis departs on a Crusade his servants promise to confine his wife which he rejects having complete trust in her The devil overhears all this and as he is unhappily married explains that he and his wife get pleasure from deceiving husbands The Marquis accepts the challenge and gives the Devil his ring as a pledge then taking leave of his wife and son Bertrade tries to distract Grislidis by telling her the story of the return of Ulysses
On a castle terrace six months later in autumn

Grislidis dreams sadly of her absent husband while the church bells toll The Devil and his wife approach Grislidis disguised as a slavetrader and a Persian houri showing her the ring to prove that the Marquis has rejected Grislidis To tempt Grislidis the Devil conjures a magic garden and lures Alain there The appearance of Los determines Grislidis not to return to Alain but his disappearance distracts her and the Devil takes the child away
While the castle servants search for Los the Devil now disguised as an obsequious old man tells Grislidis that a pirate is holding Los and will only release the child in exchange for a kiss from the Marquise The Marquis on returning meets the old man who points out Grislidis running to the shore but seeing the ring on the Devils finger realizes that he is the victim of deception The husband and wife are reunited they pray and Los is restored to them to the song of a heavenly chorus

Hurricane Michael 2000
Hurricane Michael of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season caused moderate damage in Atlantic Canada The seventeenth tropical cyclone thirteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the season Michael developed from a nontropical system to the southwest of Bermuda on October15 The system was initially subtropical but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by October17 Michael quickly strengthened into a hurricane later that day By October20 Michael peaked as a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane wind scale at a relatively high latitude of 44N The storm weakened slightly to a Category1 hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in Newfoundland on October20

As the intensity of Michael was equivalent to a Category1 hurricane during landfall high winds were reported throughout Atlantic Canada especially in Newfoundland Winds from the storm peaked at in St Lawrence Newfoundland other locations across the island reported winds of  High winds caused minor structure damage across Newfoundland confined to vinyl siding peeled off shattered windows and unroofed houses In addition sporadic power outages were also reported from Corner Brook to St Johns Michael also dropped rainfall across Atlantic Canada and in Maine The rainfall was generally light with much of the region reporting between of precipitation Michael also produced high tides accompanied by waves reported as high as by a buoy well offshore of Newfoundland

The system originated out of a nontropical coldcore upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics The low interacted with a cold front which resulted in the development of a stationary front over the Bahamas on October10 As the cold low drifted southward a surface low developed on October12 The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October15 as it merged with the upperlevel low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida Later that day the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression The storm remained stationary over warm water with sea surface temperatures around  while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics Around 0000 UTC on October16 it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm Later that day the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the lowlevel circulation
By 0000 UTC on October17 the transition was completed and Michael was reclassified as a tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the Dvorak technique Shortly thereafter the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Seventeen postanalysis later discovered it was actually a tropical storm A welldefined eye quickly developed early on October17 as Michael began to strengthen and continued to organize That afternoon Michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to a hurricane as Reconnaissance flights found winds of  At that point Michael began to move northward While Michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status the eye remained ragged yet welldefined Early on October19 Michael briefly strengthened to 140kmh 85mph before weakening slightly six hours later Tracking into cooler water Michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards Newfoundland which prevented significant weakening The acceleration was caused by a shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly midlevel flow

Unexpectedly Michael began to rapidly intensify on October19 while in extratropical transition Later that day a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of and maximum sustained winds of 155kmh 100mph making Michael a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane scale The sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over seasurface temperatures around  At 2300 UTC on October19 shortly after completing its transition to an extratropical cyclone Michael made landfall near Parsons Harbour Newfoundland with winds of 155kmh 100mph The extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across Newfoundland on October20 and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough The storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of Newfoundland that afternoon

Because it was unknown that Michael became extratropical before landfall it was initially considered the first tropical cyclone to strike Newfoundland since Hurricane Luis in 1995 Furthermore Michael was also considered the first hurricane to make landfall in Canada since Hurricane Hortense in 1996 When the Meteorological Service of Canada and the National Research Council flew a Convair research flight into Michael on October19 it was the first successful research flight made into a tropical cyclone by those agencies Subsequent flights have been made into Tropical Storm Karen Hurricane Isabel while inland Hurricane Juan and Hurricane Ophelia

In advance of the storm the Newfoundland Weather Centre posted wind warnings gale warnings storm warnings and hurricane warnings throughout Newfoundland Rainfall advisories were also issued in portions of the East Coast Central Newfoundland the South Coast and the West Coast Offshore storm force wind warnings were declared on October19 for Newfoundland waters Several Special Weather Statements were also posted

Light to moderate damage was reported throughout Newfoundland primarily as a result of the strong winds The entire region was affected by Michael though the majority of the damage was confined to small communities east of where the storm made landfall including Gaultois Harbour Breton Hermitage and English Harbour West These areas reported significant power outages and minor structural damage vinyl siding was peeled off windows were shattered and roof shingles were torn off in some localized locations The most severe damage was in Gaultois where several roofs were torn off and trees were uprooted Wind damage also occurred in the St Johns Metropolitan Area where a Sobeys store in Conception Bay South had broken windows Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the island as far east as St Johns and as far west as Corner Brook As the storm struck at low tide storm surge was insignificant However just prior to landfall waves on the coast of Newfoundland reached heights of  Rainfall near the storms track was generally around  though further inland precipitation reached  Rainfall from the hurricane amounted to at Englee a small fishing community on the Great Northern Peninsula Wind gusts peaked at at St Lawrence with other reports varying between and  Despite severe winds damage was relatively light due to high construction standards in Newfoundland where winter storms routinely result in hurricaneforce winds as well as the sparse population of the area affected

The tug Atlantic Elm lost its tow to the unmanned barge Portland Star on October19 The barge was carrying over 18000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel and was later reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay Damage was reported to numerous pleasure craft around the bay due to the waves two sailboats were toppled Also ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure as well as waves of up to 169m 55ft

On October14 and October15 the frontal boundary associated with the hurricanes precursor dropped heavy rainfall on Bermuda amounting to  However as a tropical cyclone Michael remained far from the island Impact outside Newfoundland was generally light However rainfall was greater in some areas of Nova Scotia than in Newfoundland where precipitation reached over North Mountain Light rain was also reported in New Brunswick Prince Edward Island and Quebec Effects from the storm in the United States were minimal limited to light rainfall in the state of Maine which totaled less than

<doc id="7703418" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7703418" title="Comparison of programming languages syntax">
Comparison of programming languages syntax
This comparison of programming languages compares the features of language syntax format for over 50 computer programming languages

Programming language expressions can be broadly classified into four syntax structures


Programming language statements typically have conventions for


A statement separator is used to demarcate boundaries between two separate statements A statement terminator is used to demarcate the end of an individual statement Languages that interpret the end of line to be the end of a statement are called lineoriented languages

Line continuation is a convention in lineoriented languages where the newline character could potentially be misinterpreted as a statement terminator In such languages it allows a single statement to span more than just one line

Line continuation is generally done as part of lexical analysis a newline normally results in a token being added to the token stream unless line continuation is detected
















To import a library is a way to read external possibly compiled routines programs or packages Imports can be classified by level module package class procedure and by syntax directive name attributes






The above statements can also be classified by whether they are a syntactic convenience allowing things to be referred to by a shorter name but they can still be referred to by some fully qualified name without import or whether they are actually required to access the code without which it is impossible to access the code even with fully qualified names



A block is a notation for a group of two or more statements expressions or other units of code that are related in such a way as to comprise a whole





Comments can be classified by

Inline comments are generally those that use a newline character to indicate the end of a comment and an arbitrary delimiter or sequence of tokens to indicate the beginning of a comment

Examples

Block comments are generally those that use a delimiter to indicate the beginning of a comment and another delimiter to indicate the end of a comment In this context whitespace and newline characters are not counted as delimiters

Examples













ABAP supports two different kinds of comments If the first character of a line including indentation is an asterisk codice6 the whole line is considered as a comment while a single double quote codice210 begins an inline commet which acts until the end of the line ABAP comments are not possible between the statements codice211 and codice212 because Native SQL has other usages for these characters In the most SQL dialects the double dash codice213 can be used instead


There is a wide variety of syntax styles for declaring comments in source code
codice214 in italics is used here to indicate block comment style
codice215 in italics is used here to indicate inline comment style

Centurione II Zaccaria
Centurione II Zaccaria died 1432 scion of a powerful Genoese merchant family established in the Morea was installed as Prince of Achaea by Ladislaus of Naples in 1404 and was the last ruler of the Latin Empire not under Byzantine suzerainty 

Centurione was the son of Andronikos Asen Zaccaria and grandson of Centurione I Zaccaria He succeeded his father in the barony of Arkadia modern Kyparissia in 1402 Though young he was ambitious and he overthrew his aunt Maria II Zaccaria in Achaea in 1404 a move which was approved by his overlord the king of Naples Immediately he reinforced his power on a local basis by marrying Creusa the daughter of Leonardo II Tocco lord of Zante and niece of Carlo I Tocco whose dominions covered Cephalonia and Lefkada and extended to Epirus and the western Peloponnese Centurione then made his brother Stephen the Latin Archbishop of Patras 

However Centurione was quickly at war with his alienated relatives His wifes cousin Carlo I Tocco duke of Leucas had Ladislaus absolve him from his feudal obligations to Achaea 1406 and then allied with Theodore I Palaiologos Despot of Morea made war on the principality conquering Glarentza 1408 long the principalitys chief seaport His brother Stephen however abandoned the diocese of Patras to the Venetians on loan for five years Centurione himself was forced to ally with the Venetians and Justinian Lord of Chios and to hire Albanian mercenaries to retake the port on 12 July 1414 In return for military protection he granted the ports of Glarentza and Navarino to the Giustiniani family of Genoa 

Thereafter for three years Centurione could obtain no help from Genoa pressed by the Duke of Milan on land and by the Crown of Aragon at sea In 1417 the imperial army of Constantinople led by the despot Theodore II Palaeologus and Emperor John VIII invaded Achaea They took Messenia and Elis and holed up Centurione in Glarentza from which he fled by sea in the spring of 1418 A little later Patras too fell Only by the mediation of the Venetians occupying Navarino was the prince able to secure a truce 

All that was left of the principality that once dominated Greece were a few fortresses such as the ancestral castle and barony of Chalandritsa In 1429 Thomas Palaeologus of the Morea besieged Centurione in Chalandritsa and extracted a treaty from him whereby his daughter Catherine would marry the despot and thus make him Centuriones heir in Achaea Centurione was allowed to keep his inheritance the barony of Arcadia not to be confused with the region of the same name Centurione retired to Arcadia in 1430 after the marriage was finalised He died there two years later His domains passed to the despotate of Morea and into Byzantine hands

Centurione left one illegitimate son John Asen Zaccaria who was the centre of later revolts against Greek authority

Comparison of programming languages strings
This comparison of programming languages strings compares the features of string data structures or textstring processing for over 52 various computer programming languages

Different languages use different symbols for the concatenation operator Many languages use the  symbol though several deviate from this


This section compares styles for declaring a string literal

An expression is interpolated into a string when the compilerinterpreter evaluates it and inserts the result in its place

Escaped quotes means that a flag symbol is used to warn that the character after the flag is used in the string rather than ending the string

Dual quoting means that whenever a quote is used in a string it is used twice and one of them is discarded and the single quote is then used within the string

Raw means the compiler treats every character within the literal exactly as written without processing any escapes or interpolations

Many languages have a syntax specifically intended for strings with multiple lines In some of these languages this syntax is a here document or heredoc A token representing the string is put in the middle of a line of code but the code continues after the starting token and the strings content doesnt appear until the next line In other languages the strings content starts immediately after the starting token and the code continues after the string literals terminator

East Australia hotspot
The East Australia hotspot is a volcanic hotspot that forces magma up at weak spots in the IndoAustralian Plate to form volcanoes in Eastern Australia It does not produce a single chain of volcanoes like the Hawaiian Islands Unlike most hotspots the East Australia hotspot has explosive eruptions as well as the runny lava flows of the Hawaii hotspot the Iceland hotspot and the Runion hotspot The hotspot is explosive because basaltic magma interacts with groundwater in aquifers below the surface producing violent phreatomagmatic eruptions

Tweed Volcano in New South Wales is a large shield volcano that was formed by the hotspot about 23 million years ago and has one of the biggest erosion calderas in the world

A number of the volcanoes in the province have erupted since Aboriginal settlement 46000 BP The most recent eruptions were about 5600 years ago and memories of them survive in Aboriginal folklore These eruptions formed the volcanoes Mount Schank and Mount Gambier in the Newer Volcanics Province There have been no eruptions on the Australian mainland since European settlement

German submarine U38 1938
German submarine U38 was a Type IXA Uboat of Nazi Germanys Kriegsmarine that operated during World War II

Her keel was laid down on 15 April 1937 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen as yard number 943 She was launched on 9 August 1938 and commissioned on 24 October with Kapitnleutnant Heinrich Liebe in command

U38 conducted eleven patrols as part of several flotillas During her career she sank over 30 enemy vessels and damaged a further one U38 ranks as one of the most successful Uboats in World War II She was scuttled west of Wesermnde modern Bremerhaven on 5 May 1945 Throughout the war the UBoat suffered no losses among her crew

As one of the eight original German Type IX submarines later designated IXA U38 had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged The Uboat had a total length of  a pressure hull length of  a beam of  a height of  and a draught of  The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 4046 supercharged fourstroke ninecylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced two SiemensSchuckert 2 GU 34534 doubleacting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged She had two shafts and two propellers The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of  When submerged the boat could operate for at  when surfaced she could travel at  U38 was fitted with six torpedo tubes four fitted at the bow and two at the stern 22 torpedoes one SK C32 naval gun 180 rounds and a SK C30 as well as a C30 antiaircraft gun The boat had a complement of fortyeight

U38 left the port of Wilhelmshaven on 19 August 1939 The boat operated off the coast of Lisbon returning to port on 18 September During this fourweek period she sank two ships

On 5 September 1939 U38 stopped the French ship Pluvoise examined her papers and released her Pluvoise broadcast the event warning others of the Uboat For this Liebe was reprimanded The already strict rules restricting submarine warfare were further tightened to prevent a recurrence of the event and all Uboats were instructed to avoid contact with any French merchant vessels

The British steam freighter SS Manaar was sunk on 6 September 1939 U38 opened fire on the freighter intending to stop her but she returned fire This was the first time that a merchantman fired at a Uboat Stunned by this unexpected response U38 dived and sank Manaar with torpedoes Citing the fact that Manaar had fired at him Liebe did not assist the survivors reasoning that the vessel was exempted from protection by the Submarine Protocol Berlin would release to the media the narrative that the Manaar had fired on U38 on sight While Karl Dnitz did not believe that his submarines should have to maintain adherence to the Submarine Protocol in the face of armed merchantmen due to the political situation restrictions remained in force after this incident and he was merely able to issue instruction to all submarines to exercise caution Radio Officer James Turner remained at his post until the last moment As he was leaving he found two Lascars one badly injured Turner rescued both men while under continuous fire from U38 for this he was awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal

On 11 September 1939 while flying the Irish tricolour Inverliffey was shelled and sunk In spite of Captain William Trowsdales protestation that they were Irish Liebe said that they were sorry but they would sink Inverliffey as she was carrying contraband petrol to England The crew took to the lifeboats Inverliffey burned fiercely endangering the lifeboats At risk to herself the German submarine approached threw lines to the lifeboats and towed them to safety As Captain Trowsdales lifeboat was damaged the occupants were allowed to board the Uboat The captain did not have a lifebelt so he was given one U38 stopped the American tanker RG Stewart and put Inverliffeys crew on board Just two days earlier Inver tankers transferred its ships from the Irish to the British registry

After nearly two months in port U38 left Wilhelmshaven again with Heinrich Liebe in command on 12 November 1939 This second patrol was to see the boat operate in the waters northwest of Norway

On 17 November 1939 Naval High Command SKL issued orders for U38 and to scout the location for Basis Nord a secret German naval base to be used for raids on allied shipping which was located off the Kola Peninsula and provided by the Soviet Union The mission required coded messages to be flashed to Soviet naval vessels patrolling the area preceding a Soviet escort to the prospective base location

U36 never left the Norwegian Sea and was sunk by the British submarine  U38 rounded the North Cape uneventfully and arrived in Teriberka Bay by midafternoon on 26 November Running silently into the bay U38 had to avoid being spotted by merchant vessels in order to help maintain the Soviet Unions attempted appearance of neutrality at that time U38s captain commented that while in the area of the North Cape and the Kola Peninsula he had observed thirty to forty targets and regrettably had been harmless to all of them

National Memorial Arch
The United States National Memorial Arch located in Valley Forge National Historical Park Chester County Pennsylvania is a monument built to celebrate the arrival of General George Washington and the Continental Army at Valley Forge Valley Forge was the military camp 18 miles northwest of Philadelphia where the American Continental Army spent the winter of 177778 during the American Revolutionary War Starvation disease malnutrition and exposure killed more than 2500 American soldiers by the end of February 1778

The Memorial Arch was planned during the height of the postCivil War memory boom During this period of around 50 years many monuments were planned and built in the United States many of which are on the National Mall As a result the architectural style of the Arch mirrors many of the monuments

The Memorial Arch is dedicated to the officers and private soldiers of the Continental Army December 19 1777 June 19 1778 The Arch is situated at the top of a hill at the intersection of Gulph Road and Outer Line Drive in Valley Forge National Historical Park

The United States National Memorial Arch was designed by Paul Philippe Cret with hopes its styles would mirror a simplified version of the Triumphal Arch of Titus in Rome marked the capture of Jerusalem by Emperor Titus in AD 70 Paul Philippe Cret was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and was originally from France studying at the Ecole des Beaux Arts In classical architecture the triumphal arch was erected to honor generals and emperors The United States National Memorial Arch does so by offering a national tribute to George Washington and his army The Arch stands at 60 feet tall

In 1907 the Valley Forge Park Commission planned the construction of two arches the Washington Arch at the Valley Creek entrance and a von Steuben Arch at the park entrance on the opposite end Both arches were designed to serve as entrance gates to welcome park visitors as well as monuments honoring the two generals and their troops In 1908 Congressman Irving P Wanger introduced a bill to Congress to get funding for the two arches The two arches were given a bill of 50000 each which was approved by the House of Representatives in March 1910 but failed in the Senate later that year Instead a bill for one arch was approved in October 1910 for 100000 Funds were distributed in 1911 and construction began in 1914 The arch was formally dedicated to George Washington and his troops on June 19th 1917 When the National Memorial Arch was dedicated in June 19 1917 patriotism in the US was strong due to ongoing battles in World War 1 which engendered significant interest in the memorial A train of Pullman cars brought members of Congress to Valley Forge on the day of the ceremony where they attached platforms with redwhiteandblue bunting in a celebration of patriotism Pennsylvania Governor Martin Brumbaugh spoke of the spirit of Valley Forge and its importance during hard times

To ensure the arch was still in good health a restoration project began in 1996 headed by the Freemasons of Pennsylvania The project had a budget of 15 million and provided nine tons of stabilizing steel to ensure the monument was structurally sound The restoration project ended in 1997 The Valley Forge Historical Park attracts 1 million yearly visitors and the National Memorial Arch draws in 300000 of these The arch is currently maintained by the Valley Forge National Historical Park one of 413 National Parks in the National Park Service

The National Memorial Arch is inscribed in many locations On the front of the memorial is a quote from George Washingtons letter to Governor George Clinton while at Valley Forge

Naked and starving as they are

We cannot enough admire

The incomparable Patience and Fidelity

of the Soldiery

Located on the back of the monument is a quote from a speech given by Henry Armitt Brown an American writer and orator Brown gave his speech at the 100 year anniversary of Valley Forge

And here in this place of sacrifice in this vale of humiliation in this valley of the shadow of that death out of which the life of America rose regenerate and free let us believe with an abiding faith that to them union will seem as dear and liberty as sweet and progress as glorious they were to our fathers and are to you and me and that the institutions which have made us happy preserved by the virtue of our children shall bless the remotest generation to the time to come

Chrubin
Chrubin is an opera comdie chante in three acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Francis de Croisset and Henri Cain after de Croissets play of the same name It was first performed at the Opra de MonteCarlo on 14 February 1905 with Mary Garden in the title role

The story is a lighthearted addition to Beaumarchais Figaro plays the action taking place soon after that of The Marriage of Figaro and imagines festivities in celebration of Chrubins first military commission and seventeenth birthday A farcical romp ensues brought on by Chrubin lusting after each of the female characters and inspiring general confusion

The piece contains some of Massenets most shimmering charming music and has spawned a few contemporary revivals plus several recordings since 1980 The Royal Opera House in London premiered it on 14 February 1994 in a production starring Susan Graham in the title role The performance was broadcast

Chrubin the young page of Count Almaviva has just received a commission in the army The Philosopher Chrubins teacher announces to the servants that there will be celebrations to mark this event The Duke and the Baron reveal that Chrubin has invited the famous Spanish dancer LEnsoleillad to the party Nina the Countesss maid confesses to the Philosopher that she loves Chrubin

Chrubin arrives greeting the men kissing the hands of the women and secretly slipping a love letter to the Countess When the guests leave to celebrate Chrubin tells the Philosopher that he is in love with both LEnsoleillad and the Countess Suddenly the Count storms in and threatens to kill Chrubin because he just discovered the secret love letter from the page to the Countess Nina saves the pages life when she is able to recite all the verses of the love letter and claims that it was really written to her Stupefied but calmed down the Count apologizes to the Countess and they return to the banquet The Philosopher remains to hear Chrubin proclaim once again that he loves both LEnsoleillad and the Countess

At an inn not far from the Counts castle arriving travelers argue with the Innkeeper about securing rooms for the night complaining about the low quality of the facilities Even the Countess and the Baroness are not happy with what they have received Soon officers arrive and want to celebrate Chrubins recent commission When Chrubin arrives he flirts with the mistress of Captain Ricardo and Ricardo challenges Chrubin to a duel The sudden arrival of LEnsoleillad postpones the duel but not for long Ricardo and Chrubin begin to fight when the Philosopher intervenes and arranges a truce The officers leave Chrubin successfully seduces LEnsoleillad

Chrubin stands outside LEnsoleillads balcony which is next to the balconies of the Countess and the Baroness and serenades her Each of the three women thinks that Chrubins song is really addressed to her and each drops him a keepsake The Duke the Count and the Baron discover that Chrubin is pursuing their wives and become furious They come out of hiding and challenge Chrubin to give them satisfaction Chrubin flees

Outside the inn Chrubin prepares for the three duels awaiting him and writes his last will The Philosopher arrives and gives him a practical lesson on different fighting techniques but is interrupted by the Innkeeper who is horrified to see the combat The Countess and the Baroness come from the inn seeking Chrubin determined to discover whom he was serenading last night He confesses to them that it was really LEnsoleillad he was serenading Satisfied with the explanation the Count and the Baron then call off their respective duels but Chrubin finds himself heartbroken when he sees LEnsoleillad leaving the inn in glory and not even acknowledging him

Finally when Nina arrives and tells Chrubin she is going to enter a convent because he doesnt love her as much she loves him Chrubin realizes the mistakes he has made and that she is the right woman for him He convinces her to stay with him because it is she whom he truly loves The Duke also cancels his duel with Chrubin when the page announces to him and to all his love for Nina

Although the popular notion is the amalgamation and reorganization of Canadas armed forces caused the closure of RCAF Station Hamilton in 1964 those who served in the RCAF at the time know that the closure was a result of an infamous austerity program initiated by the Diefenbaker government  the same government that forced the scrapping of the Avro Arrow

Human science
Human science studies the philosophical biological social and cultural aspects of human life Human Sciences aims to expand our understanding of the human world through a broad interdisciplinary approach It encompasses a wide range of fields  including history philosophy genetics sociology psychology evolutionary biology biochemistry neurosciences and anthropology It is the study and interpretation of the experiences activities constructs and artifacts associated with human beings The study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human beings knowledge of their existence its interrelationship with other species and systems and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the human expression and thought It is the study of human phenomena The study of the human experience is historical and current in nature It requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of human evolution Human science is the objective informed critique of human existence and how it relates to reality

Ambiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms science empirical science and scientific method have complicated the usage of the term human science with respect to human activities The term science is derived from the Latin scientia meaning knowledge Science may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with a body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws

However according to Positivists the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method the application of knowledge or mathematics As a result of the positivist influence the term science is frequently employed as a synonym for empirical science Empirical science is knowledge based on the scientific method a systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation However even with regard to the natural sciences significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific methodfor example evolutionary biology geology and astronomy studying events that cannot be repeated can use a method of historical narratives More recently usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena Thus natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science whereas the study of classics languages literature music philosophy history religion and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the humanities Ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term science is aggravated by the widespread use of the term formal science with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses such as logic mathematics and the theoretical branches of computer science information theory and statistics

The phrase human science in English was used during the 17thcentury scientific revolution for example by Theophilus Gale to draw a distinction between supernatural knowledge divine science and study by humans human science John Locke also uses human science to mean knowledge produced by people but without the distinction By the 20th century this latter meaning was used at the same time as sciences that make human beings the topic of research

Human science also humanistic social science moral science and human sciences refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an interdisciplinary framework spanning the sciences and humanities Underlying Human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as history sociology anthropology and economics and advances in such things as genetics evolutionary biology and the social sciences for the purpose of understanding our lives in a rapidly changing world Its use of an empirical methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely positivistic approach typical of the natural sciences which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations Modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure function and adaptation with a broader exploration of what it means to be human The term is also used to distinguish not only the content of a field of study from those of the natural sciences but also its methodology

The term moral science was used by David Hume 17111776 in his Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships Hume wished to establish a science of human nature based upon empirical phenomena and excluding all that does not arise from observation Rejecting teleological theological and metaphysical explanations Hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology phenomena were to be precisely characterized He emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary relating these to their empirical roots and realworld significance

A variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up Humes direction Adam Smith for example conceived of economics as a moral science in the Humean sense

Partly in reaction to the establishment of positivist philosophy and the latters Comtean intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology nonpostivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront eg for the biographer from that appropriate to the natural sciences for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost In this sense Johann Gustav Droysen contrasted the humanistic sciences need to comprehend the phenomena under consideration with natural sciences need to explain phenomena while Windelband coined the terms idiographic for a descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena and nomothetic for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws

Wilhelm Dilthey brought nineteenthcentury attempts to formulate a methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with Humes term moral science which he translated as Geisteswissenschaft  a term with no exact English equivalent Dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in a comprehensive and systematic way Meanwhile his conception of Geisteswissenschaften encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics languages literature music philosophy history religion and the visual and performing arts He characterized the scientific nature of a study as depending upon
But the specific nature of the Geisteswissenschaften is based on the inner experience Erleben the comprehension Verstehen of the meaning of expressions and understanding in terms of the relations of the part and the whole  in contrast to the Naturwissenschaften the explanation of phenomena by hypothetical laws in the natural sciences

Edmund Husserl a student of Franz Brentano articulated his phenomenological philosophy in a way that could be thought as a basis of Diltheys attempt Dilthey appreciated Husserls Logische Untersuchungen 19001901 the first draft of Husserls Phenomenology as an epoch making epistemological foundation of his conception of Geisteswissenschaften

In recent years human science has been used to refer to a philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective personal historical contextual crosscultural political and spiritual terms Human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subjectobject split in science In particular it addresses the ways in which selfreflection art music poetry drama language and imagery reveal the human condition By being interpretive reflective and appreciative human science reopens the conversation among science art and philosophy

Since Auguste Comte the positivistic social sciences have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human perception and attitude Critics argue that subjective human experience and intention plays such a central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining Rejecting the positivist influence they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective as well as objective experience The term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner psychological experience rather than outer sensory experience It is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs

The Human Sciences degree is relatively young It has been a degree subject at Oxford since 1969 and at UCL was proposed in 1973 by Professor J Z Young and implemented two years later His aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate numerate and easily able to communicate across a wide range of disciplines replacing the traditional Classics training for higherlevel government and management careers Central topics include the evolution of humans their behaviour molecular and population genetics population growth and ageing ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the environment including conservation disease and nutrition The study of both biological and social disciplines integrated within a framework of human diversity and sustainability should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such multidimensional human problems In the United Kingdom Human Sciences is offered at degree level at several institutions These include


The Human Science Lab HSL is a global centre for worldleading research on evolutionary biological and behavioural aspect of human species It is located in Oxfordshire and London Its current research focus are human cognition motivation intelligence leadership critical thinking learning ergonomics and human wellbeing

It adopts a multidisciplinary approach for most of its research incorporating neuroscience anthropology psychology evolutionary biology genetics and physiology

Tingmissartoq
Tingmissartoq was the name given to a Lockheed Model 8 Sirius flown by Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh in the 1930s Tingmissartoq means one who flies like a big bird the plane was thus christened by an Inuit boy in Godthaab Nuuk Greenland who painted the word on its side

Lockheed had introduced its Sirius model in 1929 this particular craft appears to have been built to specifications sometime between then and 1931 when the Lindberghs planned to fly to the Orient via the Great Circle Route A lowwing monoplane Tingmissartoq was outfitted with Edo floats as much of the planned route was over water

The trip was described solely as a vacation flight with no start or finish no diplomatic or commercial significance and no records to be sought It began in North Haven Maine from which point the couple flew to Ottawa From there they flew to various other sites in Canada including Moose Factory Churchill Baker Lake and Aklavik before heading to Point Barrow Alaska They continued on to Shismaref and Nome after which they crossed the Pacific Ocean to Petropavlosk From here they continued over the Kuril Islands to Tokyo where they were enthusiastically welcomed The trip continued on to China with its final stop on Lotus Lake near Nanking made on September 19

Anne Morrow Lindbergh described the trip and her impressions and experiences in her book North to the Orient

While at Hankow the plane with the Lindberghs aboard was being lowered into the Yangtze River from the British aircraft carrier when it capsized accidentally One wing hit a ships cable and was damaged necessitating the crafts return to the United States for repairs

Tingmissartoq was to see action again in 1933 as a result of international interest in the development of commercial air transport Pan American Airways Imperial Airways Deutsche Luft Hansa KLM and Air France collaborated on a study of international air routes The assigned areas were Newfoundland to Europe via Greenland Newfoundland via the great circle route to Ireland Newfoundland southeast to the Azores and Lisbon Miami Bermuda the Azores and Lisbon and across the South Atlantic from Brazil to Cape Verde Pan American was given the responsibility for the first of these and sent Lindbergh as the companys technical advisor to survey the route Accompanied once more by Anne he took off from New York City on July 9 in the rebuilt craft The purpose of the trip was to gain as much data as possible on the area to be covered

The plane had been fitted with a Sperry artificial horizon and a directional gyro since its previous flight The engine too was new a Wright Cyclone SR1820F2 of 710hp All possible spaces were used including the wings and floats these contained the gasoline tanks There was also plenty of emergency equipment for use in the event of a forced landing

To maintain radio contact with the couple Pan American hired a Danish ship the Jellinge to stay within range in the area of Labrador Greenland and Iceland It also delivered advance supplies for them to Halifax St Johns Cartwright Greenland and Iceland

Tingmissartoq flew first from New York to Hopedale Labrador hugging the eastern CanadaUS border along the way From here the Lindberghs made the first major hop over water flying 650 miles to Godthaab The couple then crisscrossed Greenland to Baffin Island and back and then flew to Iceland They continued the trip by flying around the world visiting first the major cities of Europe they continued to Moscow then down Africas west coast and across the South Atlantic to South America Here they flew down the Amazon River and then turned north through Trinidad and Barbados before returning to the United States They returned to New York on December 19 having traveled 30000 miles and visited four continents and twentyone countries The information they provided proved invaluable in planning transatlantic air transport routes

Tingmissartoq was on display in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City until 1955 when it was acquired by the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton Ohio It was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 and is currently on display in the Pioneers of Flight gallery of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC

Bismuth chloride
Bismuth chloride or butter of bismuth is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula BiCl It is a common source of the Bi ion In the gas phase and in the crystal the species adopts a pyramidal structure in accord with VSEPR theory

Bismuth chloride can be synthesized directly by passing chlorine over bismuth

or by dissolving bismuth metal in aqua regia evaporating the mixture to give BiCl2HO which can be distilled to form the anhydrous trichloride

Alternatively it may be prepared by adding hydrochloric acid to bismuth oxide and evaporating the solution

Also the compound can be prepared by dissolving bismuth in concentrated nitric acid and then adding solid sodium chloride into this solution

In the gas phase BiCl is pyramidal with a ClBiCl angle of 975 and a bond length of 242 pm In the solid state each Bi atom has three near neighbors at 250 pm two at 324 pm and three at a mean of 336 pm the image above highlights the three closest neighbours This structure is similar to that of AsCl AsBr SbCl and SbBr

Bismuth chloride is hydrolyzed readily to bismuth oxychloride BiOCl

This reaction can be reversed by adding an acid such as hydrochloric acid

Reaction of solid BiCl with water vapour below 50C has been shown to produce the intermediate monohydrate BiClHO

Bismuth chloride is an oxidizing agent being readily reduced to metallic bismuth by reducing agents

In contrast to the usual expectation by consistency with periodic trends BiCl is a Lewis acid forming a variety of chloro complexes such as BiCl that strongly violates the octet rule Furthermore the octahedral structure of this coordination complex does not follow the predictions of VSEPR theory since the lone pair on bismuth is unexpectedly stereochemically inactive The dianionic complex BiCl does however adopt the expected square pyramidal structure

Bismuth chloride is used as a catalyst in organic synthesis In particular it catalyzes the Michael reaction and the Mukaiyama aldol reaction reaction The addition of other metal iodides increases its catalytic activity

Bismuth chloride is toxic It causes irritation to the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract Contact with skin may cause burns

Located on  Tyler Hill Camp features two lakes Silver and Laurel for boating and waterskiing 12 tennis courts 4 softballbaseball fields 7 basketball courts 1 mini court 1 regulation roller hockey rink 1 smaller one and an onsite 18hole par 3 and 4 golf course

The first major addition to camp in the 1990s was an swimming pool in 1992 The pool was built where a hardtop volleyball court once stood down by Silver Lake The same year former Boys Bunk 1 and 2 was converted into a movie theater featuring a projection screen seats from the then recently renovated Callicoon movie theater

During the summer of 1995 a new regulation roller hockey rink was built The following summer a new basketball court was built right next to the hockey rink Both the hockey rink and basketball court were covered in 1997 completing the Tylerdome The dome featured high ceilings and was open on all sides allowing for cool breezes throughout the hot summer days but shelter from the intense sun and offered an alternative location for rainy day activities

In 2002 a wraparound porch was added to the canteen and the following year the interior was renovated adding wood paneling throughout the perimeter of the building Two new boys and girls bunks were also added due to the increasing camp enrollment allowing for more space in the latter bunks In the early part of the decade the main and secondary roads that lined the campus were paved followed by the addition of new footpaths in 2006
During the winter of 2002  2003 the Social Hall suffered extensive roof damage after a sizable amount of snowfall The building was irreparable so plans were drawn up to construct a new larger building The foundation was laid in 2003 and the building was officially completed for the 2004 summer season The building features a stateoftheart sound booth in the back of the building with costume rooms larger bathrooms and a dance room and weight room off to either sides The building received another facelift in the fall of 2006 when hard wood flooring was placed throughout the building

For the summer of 2006 the Arts and Crafts building received a much needed renovation Also the former Cooking Shack formerly the Nature Shack was taken down and a patio was put on the foundation to make a cooking and seating area for breakfast and lunch Cooking was moved into the Arts  Crafts pavilion overlooking the breakfast and lunch area In the fall of 2006 construction began on a new Gymnastics pavilion overlooking Silver Lake This pavilion replaced the existing gymnastics facility

In 2006 Andy Siegel and his wife Wendy assumed the position as DirectorOwners of Tyler Hill Camp along with Justin Mayer as Assistant Director and Bette Jane Weisenthal as Associate Director of Girls Camp

In 2009 the popular movie theater was changed back into bunks 23 and 24 due to the enrollment of 35 new campers A new movie theater was constructed behind boys bunks 5 and 6

Shortly after the summer of 2009 Justin Mayer the Assistant Director left his position at Tyler Hill Camp for the Director position at Timber Lake West Camp 
In 2010 the camp Health Center received a major renovation including an extension to accommodate additional campers and a wraparound porch

After the summer of 2010 the Head of the Waterfront Nick Swim Williams was announced as the new Assistant Director of Tyler Hill Camp The position of Head of Waterfront would be filled by one of the lifeguards Luke OConnor

Prior to the summer of 2011 the Horse Stables were converted into the new Campitheatre which is an outdoor stage and benches set behind the Tyler Dome on Big Al Lake

An endofthesummer competition where the entire camp is split into 2 teams Blue and White led by counselor leaders known as officers Lasting between 5 and 6 days points are earned through athletic activities sportsmanship boating and swimming relays all culminating with a singing competition A hatchet is hidden in a welldisguised location with clues released twice a day leading to the hatchets general vicinity Many of the clues are riddles or anagrams

Ariane is an opera in five acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Catulle Mends after Greek mythology the tale of Ariadne It was first performed at the Palais Garnier in Paris on 31 October 1906 with Lucienne Brval in the title role

Although not a proper sequel as Ariane dies in both pieces Massenets later opera Bacchus is a companion to Ariane containing a number of common characters and the same librettist Ariane has never maintained popularity and belongs to Massenets later works that were considered outmoded for their date of composition The piece did however inspire this quote from the great French composer Gabriel Faur Ariane a noble great and moving work The opera was performed during Massenets lifetime then was dropped from the repertoire receiving only limited revivals in 1937 21 February and 27 August 1937 at the Paris Opra

Recently it has received performances in a new production at the Massenet Festival in Sainttienne on 9 November 2007 directed by JeanLouis Pichon conducted by Laurent Campellone As one critic noted it is one of the most Wagnerian of Massenets operas

The story is based on the mythology surrounding Theseus and the sisters Ariane and Phdre The two sisters are both in love with Theseus yet he chooses Phdre over Ariane When Phdre is killed by the toppled statue of Adonis Ariane travels to the underworld to beg Persphone for her sisters resurrection Softened by Arianes offering of roses Persphone complies and Phdre returns to earth Theseus is then made to choose among the sisters again and once more chooses Phdre abandoning Ariane on the banks of Naxos Distraught she is lured into the sea by the voices of the beckoning sirens

Omemee Ontario
Omemee is a community within the city of Kawartha Lakes Ontario Canada formerly known as Victoria County Located on Ontario Highway 7 which is the TransCanada Highway Omemee is one of the major communities in the Kawartha Lakes as the proclaimed city is vastly rural and has but one major population centre The community had a population of 1247 in the Canada 2011 Census It is located between the city of Peterborough and the community of Lindsay Lindsay is the largest population centre in the city of Kawartha Lakes and serves as the administrative centre as it did with Victoria County

Omemee was the early childhood home of musician Neil Young and of his father author and sportswriter Scott Young

In late 2014 Omemees Youngtown museum closed for good and shipped its content to neighbouring town Lindsay for display

August 2016 Omemee was featured on Canadian comedian Jonny Harris CBC Still Standing program Filmed at Thanksgiving the year prior in the towns city hall the episode focused on Neil Young and his childhood friend taking rifle shooting lessons from the town doctor and going adventure diving in a swimming pool

The community that grew up around William Cottinghams mills on the Pigeon River was first called Williamstown and then Metcalfe In 1857 the community was renamed Omemee for the Omemee tribe which once hunted in the area The word means pigeon in the Mississauga language

The construction of the Port Hope Lindsay and Beaverton Railway in 1857 when the town also acquired a post office fostered the growth of the community which became a thriving shipping point for timber and grain

Until the 1860s Omemee competed with Lindsay as the largest town in Victoria County At its zenith in the late 1800s Omemee had a grist mill two sawmills a tannery a foundry a shingle mill a cloth mill three churches four hotels an elementary and secondary school and a newspaper

As Ontarios economy shifted away from agriculture and surrounding towns grew the industrial section of Omemee declined until 100 years later only the Regal Stationery Company remained the factory has since closed Today Omemees economy is supported by the towns population as well as seasonal residents and retirement communities in the surrounding area

Omemee has two public schools Lady Eaton Elementary kindergarten to grade 3 and Scott Young grades 4 to 8 Scott Young Public School was named after Scott Young a journalist and author of many books and father of musician Neil Young

In 2015 due to enrolment decline in Scott Young Middle school to the point where both schools were below 50 per cent Ministry of Education identified capacity the Trillium Lakelands District School Board moved the overflow of grade 4s from Lady Eaton over to Scott Young Then in late 2016 it was announced that Lady Eaton Elementary school will close for good in June 2018

Though Lady Eaton is to be closed there are plans to keep the daycare open to the public the board can work with the Omemee Childrens Centre in the hopes of moving the daycare to Scott Young

The ghost town of Omemee North Dakota was named after the Ontario Omemee as the formers first post master hailed from the latter

In 1970 Crosby Stills Nash  Young released Dj Vu with a recording of the song Helpless which was based on Neil Youngs hometown Omemee referring to the town in the first verse as There is a town in north OntarioAll my changes were there

Omemee known for being a previous railroad hub and source of heating coal for the area is going back to its roots somewhat As of November 2018 the old coal depot will once again be open for the coal business Due to a breakdown in negotiations with the City of Kawartha Lakes to turn the property into a storage facility and residence with a public fruit orchard The owner Austin Westlake has decided that the only cost effective use for the property is to create the largest coal facility in Ontario There will be no rail service but in the state of the art facility customers will be able to experience coal once again The facility is scheduled to open November 30 2018

Sarraounia
Sarraounia Mangou was a chiefpriestess of the animist Azna subgroup of the Hausa who fought French colonial troops of the VouletChanoine Mission at the Battle of Lougou in presentday Nigeria in 1899 She is the subject of the 1986 film Sarraounia based on the novel of the same name by Nigerien writer Abdoulaye Mamani

Sarraounia means queen or female chief in the Hausa language Among the predominately animist Azna people of Lougou and surrounding Hausa towns and villages the term refers to a lineage of female rulers who exercised both political and religious power Sarraounia Mangou was the most famous of the Sarraounias due to her resistance against French colonial troops at the Battle of Lougou in 1899 While most chiefs in Niger pragmatically submitted to French power Sarraounia Mangou mobilized her people and resources to confront the French forces of the VouletChanoine Mission which launched a fierce attack on her fortress capital of Lougou

Overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the French she and her fighters retreated tactically from the fortress and engaged the attackers in a protracted guerrilla battle which eventually forced the French to abandon their project of subduing her

The 1986 film Sarraounia is a retelling of her struggle against Voulet and Chanoines troops
But according to native oral historians she fought the French colonialists with her untold and mythical powers

Hand dancing
Hand dancing also known as DC hand dancing or DC swing is a form of swing dance that can be traced as far back as the 1920s from Lindy Hop and the Jitterbug to the 1950s when dancers in the District of Columbia developed their own variety It is characterized by gliding footwork and continuous hand connectioncommunication between the partners hence its name It fell out of favor during the disco era but in the 1980s Hand Dance resurfaced in the Washington dance community

In 1993 the Smithsonian Institution recognized Hand Dance as an American Art Form and the Smithsonian exhibit led to the establishment of the National Hand Dance Association

In 1999 it was formally recognized as the official dance of DC by the district council

In 2000 the book DC Hand Dance Capitol City Swing by Kim L Frazier was published about the history definition philosophy culture structure steps and styles of Hand Dance It provides discussions on etiquette the competitive and social dance environment the benefits of the dance social norms the traditional and contemporary variations

In 2008 hand dancing was featured on the television contest So You Think You Can Dance with the auditions of contestants Markus Smith and Deonna Ball Their performance followed a brief exposition on its history and video footage from a hand dancing party at a VFW hall in Suitland Maryland

On 1 January 2011 the Washington Post featured an article on Hand Dancing highlighting District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Grays participation in the art form

The TRIState Connection holds an annual hand dance competition in Tysons Corner each September

Richardson Mountains
The Richardson Mountains are a mountain range located west of the mouth of the Mackenzie River in northern Yukon Canada They parallel the northernmost part of the boundary between Yukon and Northwest Territories

Although some sources consider the Richardson Mountains to be part of the Canadian Rockies the common northern limit of the Canadian Rockies is the Liard River which is a long way south The Richardson Mountains are a subrange of the Brooks Range which lies mostly in Alaska

<doc id="7704373" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704373" title="SK channel">
SK channel
SK channels small conductance calciumactivated potassium channels are a subfamily of Caactivated K channels They are so called because of their small single channel conductance in the order of 10 pS SK channels are a type of ion channel allowing potassium cations to cross the cell membrane and are activated opened by an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium through Ntype calcium channels Their activation limits the firing frequency of action potentials and is important for regulating afterhyperpolarization in the neurons of the central nervous system as well as many other types of electrically excitable cells This is accomplished through the hyperpolarizing leak of positively charged potassium ions along their concentration gradient into the extracellular space This hyperpolarization causes the membrane potential to become more negative SK channels are thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity and therefore play important roles in learning and memory

SK channels are expressed throughout the central nervous system They are highly conserved in mammals as well as in other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans SK channels are specifically involved in the medium afterhyperpolarizing potential mAHP They affect both the intrinsic excitability of neurons and synaptic transmission They are also involved in calcium signaling SK channels control action potential discharge frequency in hippocampal neurons midbrain dopaminergic neurons dorsal vagal neurons sympathetic neurons nucleus reticularis thalmic neurons inferior olive neurons spinal and hypoglossal motoneurons mitral cells in the olfactory bulb and cortical neurons

SK potassium channels share the same basic architecture with Shakerlike voltagegated potassium channels Four subunits associate to form a tetramer Each of the subunits has six transmembrane hydrophobic alpha helical domains S1S6 A loop between S5 and S6called the Ploopprovides the poreforming region that always faces the center of the channel Each of the subunits has six hydrophobic alpha helical domains that insert into the cell membrane A loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains forms the potassium ion selectivity filter SK channels may assemble as homotetrameric channels or as heterotetrameric channels consisting of more than one SK channel subtype In addition SK potassium channels are tightly associated with the protein calmodulin which accounts for the calcium sensitivity of these channels Calmodulin participates as a subunit of the channel itself bound to the cytoplasmic Cterminus region of the peptide called the calmodulin binding domain CaMBD

Additional association of the phosphorylating kinase CK2 and dephosphorylating phosphatase PP2A on the cytoplasmic face of the protein allow for enriched Casensitivityand thuskinetics modulation CK2 serves to phosphorylate the SKCabound CaM at the T80 residue rather than the channel helices themselves to reduce calcium sensitivity This may only be accomplished when the channel pore is closed PP2A dephosphorylates this residue upon CK2 inhibition The selectivity filter of all SK channel subtypeswhether SK1 SK2 SK3 or SK4is highly conserved and reflects the selectivity seen in any potassium channel a GYGD amino acid residue sequence on the poreforming loop These channels are considered to be voltageindependent as they possess only two of seven positively charged amino acid residues that are typically seen in a prototypical voltagegated potassium channel

The SK channel family contains 4 members  SK1 SK2 SK3 and SK4 SK4 is often referred to as IK Intermediate conductance due to its higher conductance 20  80 pS

The SK channel gating mechanism is controlled by intracellular calcium levels Calcium enters the cell via voltage activated calcium channels as well as through NMDA receptors Calcium does not directly bind to the SK channel Calcium binds to the protein calmodulin CaM When bound to calcium CaM binds to the CaMbinding domain on the intracellular subunit of the SK channel When each of the four CaMbinding domain subunits is bound to calmodulin the SK channel changes conformation This transitions the channel from a tetramer of monomers to a folded dimer of dimers which results in rotation of the CaMbinding domains This rotation causes the mechanical opening of the channel gate The time constant of SK channel activation is approximately 5 ms When calcium levels are depleted the time constant for channel deactivation ranges from 1560 ms

All SK channels can be pharmacologically blocked by quaternary ammonium salts of a plantderived neurotoxin bicuculline In addition SK channels SK1SK3 but not SK4 IK are sensitive to blockade by the bee toxin apamin and the scorpion venoms tamapin and charybdotoxin ChTx all via competitive antagonism for access to the mouth of the pore formation All known blockers compete for roughly the same binding site the pore in all subtypes This provides a physical blockage to the channel pore Since all blockers are universal to all three types of SK channels there is an incredibly narrow therapeutic window that does not allow for blocking of a specific SK channel subtype Quaternary ammonium salts like bicuculline and tetraethylammonium TEA enter the pore via the selectivity filter by acting as a potassium mimic in the dehydration step of pore permeation

The following molecules are other toxins and organic compounds that also inhibit all three small SK channel subtypes to any even minimal degree

Allosteric modulators of small SK channels work by changing the apparent calcium sensitivity of the channels Examples include

In dendritic spines SK channels are directly coupled to NMDA receptors In addition to being activated by calcium flow through voltagegated calcium channels SK channels can be activated by calcium flowing through NMDA receptors which occurs after depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane Experiments using apamin have shown that specifically blocking SK channels can increase learning and longterm potentiation In addition brainderived neurotrophic factor BDNF causes the downregulation of SK channels which facilitates longterm potentiation Increasing SK channel activity has the opposite effect and serves to impair learning An increase in SK channel activity that occurs over time may be related to decreases in plasticity and memory that is seen with aging

The dysfunction of potassium channels including SK channels is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease PD a progressive neurodegenerative disorder

SK channel blockers control the firing rate the number of action potentials produced by a neuron in a given time and the firing pattern the way action potentials are allocated throughout time through their production of mAHP SK channel activators decrease the firing rate and neuron sensitivity to excitatory stimuli whereas SK channel blockers increase the firing rate and sensitivity to excitatory stimuli This has important implications as to the function of dopaminergic neurons For example the amount of dopamine released by midbrain dopaminergic neurons is much higher when the frequency of firing increases than when they fire at a constant rate

SK channels are widely expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons Multiple pharmacological techniques have been used to adjust SK affinity for calcium ions thereby modulating the excitability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons Blockage of SK channels in vivo increases the firing rate of substantia nigra cells which increases the amount of dopamine released from the synaptic terminals When a large amount of dopamine accumulates in the cytosol cell damage is induced due to the buildup of free radicals and damage to mitochondria 
In addition techniques have been used to modulate SK channels in order to alter the dopamine phenotype of neurons After the loss of TH tyrosine hydroxylasepositive substantia nigra compacta SNc neurons due to Parkinsonsinduced neurodegeneration the number of these neurons can partially recover via a cell phenotype shift from TH tyrosine hydroxylasenegative to TH The number of TH neurons can be altered by SK channel modulation to be specific the infusion of SK agonists into substantia nigra increases the number of TH neurons whereas the infusion of SK antagonist decreases the number of TH neurons The reason for this relationship between SK channels and TH expression may be due to neuroprotection against dopamine toxicity

Based on the two opposing roles of SK channels in the pathogenesis of PD two contradictory methods have been suggested as therapeutic options for the improvement of PD symptoms
Inhibition of SK channels
Facilitation of SK channels

<doc id="7704526" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704526" title="Ledgewood Circle">
Ledgewood Circle
The Ledgewood Circle was the intersection of Route 10 and US Route 46 US46 in the Ledgewood section of Roxbury Township New Jersey Both highways are major eastwest arteries in Morris County New Jersey and both are also lined with businesses and strip malls Consequently Route 10 and US 46 experience heavy daily use especially during the rush hours and on the weekends This intersection is also the western terminus of Route 10

In the mid 1990s the New Jersey Department of Transportation dismantled the Ledgewood Circle and reconfigured the two highways into a signalized Tintersection

Before the circle was replaced eastbound traffic on US 46 had to travel almost threequarters of the way around the circle while contending with traffic merging on to US 46 east and west from Route 10 west in order to continue traveling on US 46 east

Travelers on US Route 46 west wishing to travel on Route 10 east also had to go almost threequarters of the way around the circle with the same merging traffic to reach Route 10 eastbound There were traffic metering signals to provide gaps in traffic so that motorists could in theory move in and out of the circle safely but these signals were overwhelmed by the volume of daily traffic entering and exiting the circle and were not effective

Speeding around the circle was a hazard as well because the roadway was broad and the circle itself had a large diameter allowing those who wished to travel at highway speeds 5055 mph to do so even though these speeds were significantly higher than the advisory speed of  This was the cause of many serious automobile accidents at the circle and another reason that the circle was replaced

Since the circle has been replaced traffic approaching the former circle from the west while moving eastbound on US Route 46 uses a new roadway that cuts through the middle of the former circle Traffic must then use two dedicated left turn lanes governed by a signal to turn onto the original alignment of US 46 eastbound Motorists wishing to travel on Route 10 eastbound maintain their travel lanes as those lanes become Route 10 eastbound There is a signal for these lanes too it stops eastbound traffic to allow for Uturns and westbound US 46 traffic to make a left turn onto eastbound Route 10

Traffic on US 46 westbound merges on to a new two lane roadway that occupies the former southwestern roadway of the old circle Traffic is governed by a signal which permits westbound US 46 traffic to merge on to the original divided highway that carried US Route 46 west from the circle Westbound travellers wishing to make a left turn onto Route 10 eastbound bear left from USS Route 46 westbound before this merge and use dedicated left turn lanes to make this move

Traffic on Route 10 westbound wishing to travel onto US Route 46 eastbound merge right at the terminus of Route 10 and travel onto the original alignment of US 46 eastbound There is no signal for this traffic and it must yield to on coming traffic Travelers on Route 10 westbound wishing to use US 46 westbound maintain their travel lanes and merge onto the original US 46 westbound divided highway via a new roadway built through the middle of the old Ledgewood Circle These lanes are governed by a traffic signal which allows for Uturns and US Route 46 eastbound traffic to make a left turn to continue on US 46 eastbound

While the intersection is more heavily used than ever traffic moves through much more safely and fluidly with this new alignment

A purple European beech tree grew in the former Ledgewood Circle The tree was going to be destroyed during the replacement project and as a result a grassroots effort was taken up by local residents led by Marion Whitescarver beginning in 1994 to save the tree Philip Amsterdam president of the Marsellis Warner Corp who was hired to eliminate the Ledgewood Circle offered to move the tree at no cost to the township He was told that tree experts hired by the municipality said it wouldnt be feasible to move it as they determined the tree sat in a morass of rocks and boulders making it impossible to dig under The New Jersey Department of Transportation agreed that the tree needed to come down

On November 20 1997 the tree was given a oneday reprieve to consider opposition to cutting down the tree Construction was halted to consider Amsterdams offer The township was not persuaded to delay construction to remove the tree for replanting which would have required colder temperatures to ensure a frozen root ball and the tree was cut down on November 21 1997

Thrse opera
Thrse is an opera in two acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Jules Claretie 
While Thrse remains among Massenets lesserknown works the piece has spawned a number of revivals and recordings

Thrse was first performed at the Opra de MonteCarlo on 7 February 1907 featuring Lucy Arbell in the title role Edmond Clment as Armand de Clerval and Hector Dufranne as Andr Thorel For the Paris premiere at the OpraComique in 1911 Arbell and Clment repeated their roles while the offstage harpsichord in the minuet was played by Louis Dimer the work on this occasion was paired in a doublebill with the premiere of Ravels Lheure espagnole

The US public performance premiere of the work was presented by Amato Opera on 1 June 1985 with piano accompaniment and featured Caryn Lerner James Landers and Roger Hayden in the principal roles A slightly abridged concert version of the opera was presented in New York in 2007 featuring Julie De Vaere in the title role The US West Coast premiere of the complete opera was presented in concert on 24 April 2013 at La Sierra University in Riverside California featuring Cynthia Jansen Kevin St Clair and Aram Barsamian in the principal roles and Aaron Ball and Owen Lovejoy in comprimario roles 

A concert revival of Thrse on 21 July 2012 at the Festival de Radio France et Montpellier led to the release of a recording in April 2013 It featured Nora Gubisch Charles Castronovo and tienne Dupuis in the leading roles and was conducted by Alain Altinoglu

The story takes place during the French Revolution and concerns Thrse who is torn between duty and affection between her husband Andr Thorel a Girondist and her lover the nobleman Armand de Clerval Although she had decided to follow her lover into exile when her husband is being led to execution she shouts Vive le roi Long live the king amid the frenzied crowd and is dragged to her husbands side and marched to the guillotine

October 1792 Clagny near Versailles France 

In order to escape the wrath of the Revolution the Marquis de Clerval Armand has fled France His childhood friend Andr the son of the steward of the Clerval castle and now a Girondist revolutionary representative has bought the chateau at an auction in order to be able to restore it to its rightful owner Armand after the Revolution Unbeknownst to him Andrs young wife Thrse and his friend Armand are in love 

Watching the soldiers go off to war Thrse tells Andr that because of his political activities and duties as a Girondist representative she is often left alone and fears that one day he may fall victim to the rage of the revolutionaries She dreads returning to Paris and wishes they could get away from the fury of the revolution Sensing that there might be something else that is making her so anxious Andr asks his wife if her heart belongs to him entirely Thrse responds defensively that she would not be so ungrateful as to not love him after all she was a penniless orphan girl and thanks to him she is now the wife of a Girondist a representative Her duty she tells him is to ensure his happiness Andr responds that she is the very essence of his happiness and that he wants nothing more than to live beside her 

Left alone Thrse muses that she venerates the good kind and devoted Andr but she is still in love with Armand She recalls their last meeting  the previous summer in that very place  where they bid each other farewell before he fled France

Armand returns to the chateau incognito and alone with Thrse tries to rekindle their former love She rebuffs him telling him that she owes everything to her husband Andr and her duty is to be by his side Armand is almost recognized by the revolutionaries but Andr vouches for him and offers him asylum under his roof

June 1793 Paris France

A few months later the situation has become much worse King Louis XVI has been executed five months prior and the Girondists are falling out of favor Every day more people are tried by the revolutionary court and sentenced to death Thrse bemoans the fact that they are stuck in the middle of this horror and wishes they could be far away Sensing that she is concerned for Armands safety Andr tries to calm her down by saying that no one would suspect him a representative to be hiding a nobleman in his home Yes it is dangerous he says but he has a duty to protect his friend He has secured a letter of safe conduct for Armand with which he will be able to leave France and thus escape the Reign of Terror Andr tells Thrse that once Armand is safely out of the country the two of them will be able to move out to the country away from the horror currently surrounding them and will live peacefully

At this moment their friend Morel enters with terrible news the growing wrath of the mob below has turned towards the Girondists Andr feels that it is his duty to be alongside his comrades Before leaving he tells Armand that he may not be able to protect him for much longer and arranges for him to leave the country He bids his friend and Thrse farewell and goes down to the street to join the Girondists Alone Armand tries to persuade Thrse to flee with him to escape the horror of the Revolution and live happily together After some hesitation Thrse finally agrees but at this moment Morel enters and tells them that Andr has been arrested and is being led to the guillotine Thrse urges Armand to leave first and promises to meet him later and then flee the country Left alone she watches Andr as he is being led towards the guillotine Torn between her love for Armand and her sense of duty towards Andr she finally makes the decision to lean out the window and scream Long Live the King The enraged revolutionaries rush in and arrest her Thrse takes her place next to her husband as the two are led to their execution

Independence referendum
An independence referendum is a type of referendum in which the citizens of a territory decide whether the territory should become an independent sovereign state An independence referendum that results in a vote for independence does not always ultimately result in independence

The articles on specific referendums are linked with dates in the table on past referendums

An independence referendum typically arises first after political success for nationalists of a territory This could come in the election of politicians or parties with separatist policies or from pressure from nationalist organisations

Negotiations for the terms of an independence referendum may take place between the nationalists and the government which exercises sovereignty over the territory If terms can be agreed then the independence referendum can be held with its result binding and respected by the international community Independence referendums can be held without the consent of governments but their results are usually ignored by the international community

Various issues can be discussed in negotiations such as the date and timing of the poll as well as voter eligibility For these instances common electoral practice is often widely used although there can be deviations as seen with the lowering of the voting age for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum

Other issues to be negotiated include what question or questions should be on the ballot and what the voting options could be Independence referendums can offer options of greater autonomy as well as or instead of the status quo They can also put forward other constitutional questions to ballot The questions that referendums ask may be revised if parties involved in negotiations consider them to be too leading

Negotiations notably need to address what would make a result binding For some independence referendums a simple majority is required for one option In other cases a quota can be used where a certain percentage of the vote or the electorate needs to be in favour of an option for it to be binding
Successful negotiations can be hard to achieve for nationalists as governments can be reluctant to give up sovereignty For example nationalists planned to hold a referendum in Catalonia in 2014 but met opposition from the Spanish government As a result the referendum that went ahead was unofficial and nonbinding

In the event of a vote for independence there may be negotiations on the terms of secession for the territory from the sovereign state A declaration of independence for a new state is then made and international recognition can follow as well as membership of international organisations such as the United Nations In cases involving nonbinding referendums this can lead to a unilateral declaration of independence and therefore partially recognised or selfproclaimed states

In the event of a vote against independence there may still be a strong nationalist movement and calls for there to be a rerun of the independence referendum For example after two referendums in Quebec the Parti Qubcois has continued to raise the prospect of holding another referendum and the Scottish National Party has said that there should be a repeat of the 2014 referendum if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union

Bad quarto
A bad quarto in Shakespearean scholarship is a quartosized printed edition of one of Shakespeares plays that is considered to be unauthorised and is theorised to have been pirated from a theatrical performance without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or alternatively written down later from memory by an actor or group of actors in the cast  the latter process has been termed memorial reconstruction Since the quarto derives from a performance hence lacks a direct link to the authors original manuscript the text would be expected to be bad ie to contain corruptions abridgements and paraphrasings 

In contrast a good quarto is considered to be a text that is authorised literally ie approved by the author and which may have been printed from the authors manuscript or a working draft thereof known as his foul papers or from a scribal copy or prompt copy derived from the manuscript or foul papers

The concept of the bad quarto originates in 1909 attributed to A W Pollard and W W Gregg The theory defines as bad quartos the first quarto printings of Romeo and Juliet Henry V The Merry Wives of Windsor and Hamlet and seeks to explain why there are substantial textual differences between those quartos and the 1623 printing of the first folio edition of the plays

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors including Peeles The Battle of Alcazar Greenes Orlando Furioso and the collaborative script Sir Thomas More

The theory has been accepted studied and expanded by many scholars but some modern scholars are challenging it and those such as Eric Sams consider the entire theory to be without foundation Jonathan Bate states that late twentieth and early twentyfirst century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice

The concept of the bad quarto as a category of text was created by bibliographer Alfred W Pollard in his book Shakespeare Folios and Quartos 1909 The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors John Heminges and Henry Condell which appears at the beginning of Shakespeares First Folio and is titled To the Great Variety of Readers Heminges and Condell refer to diuerse stolne and surreptitious copies of the plays Up until 1909 it had been thought that the reference to stolen copies was a general reference to all quarto editions of the plays

Pollard however claimed that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to bad quartos as defined by himself and Pollard listed as bad the first quartos of Romeo and Juliet 1597 Henry V 1600 The Merry Wives of Windsor 1602 Hamlet 1603 and Pericles 1609 Pollard pointed out that not only do these five texts contain badness namely significant textual errors and corruptions but also that there is legal badness in those who pirated them

Scholar W W Greg worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of The Merry Wives of Windsor which is a work that is significant in the history of the bad quarto theory Greg described how the text may have been copied and he identified the actor who played the role of Host as the culprit Greg called the process that the actor may have used memorial reconstruction a phrase later used by other scholars  meaning literally a reconstruction of it from memory

For Shakespeare the First Folio of 1623 is the crucial document of the 36 plays contained in that collection 18 have no other source The other 18 plays had been printed in quarto form at least once between 1594 and 1623 but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts which are termed stoln and surreptitious copies maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors 18th and 19thcentury editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio

It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented shorthand reporting a practice mentioned by Thomas Heywood in the Prologue to his 1605 play If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody reporters would surreptitiously take down a plays text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest However Greg and RCRhodes argued instead for an alternative theory since some of the minor speeches varied less from the folio text than those of major characters their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had reconstructed the play texts from memory and thereby gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but a less correct report of the other actors parts

The idea caught on among Shakespearean scholars Peter Alexander added The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster 1594 and The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York 1595  the earliest versions of Henry VI Part 2 and Henry VI Part 3  to the roster of bad quartos both had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeares later versions of the same histories The concept of the bad quarto was then extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare and by the second half of the 20th century the idea was being widely adopted However by the end of the century dissenting views had been published such as the work of Laurie Maguire then at the University of Ottawa

Various problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis particularly concerning the notion of memorial reconstruction Furthermore the hypothesis makes no allowance for changes to occur in the text across the enormous period between 1594 and 1623 almost thirty years from revisions by the author abridgements for special circumstances or natural evolution resulting from improvements to the text made by the actors in performance

For some plays critics seem undecided even as to what amounts to a bad quarto The first quarto of Richard III for instance is often now termed a bad quarto even though it is an unusually good bad quarto Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays he studied which possessed problematical features that could not be explained and in the end retreated to arguing instead that the quartos of the two early histories were partial memorial reconstructions

Some critics including Eric Sams and Hardin Craig dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction

Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision or abridgement by the author Steven Urkowitz argued the hypothesis that King Lear is a revised work in Shakespeares Revision of King Lear Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon such as Alls Well That Ends Well and Troilus and Cressida make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote in the earliest rawest stage of his career and later revised with more sophisticated additions

Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis in preference to a badquarto hypothesis for The Taming of a Shrew the alternative version of Shakespeares The Taming of the Shrew

Robert Burkharts 1975 study Shakespeares Bad Quartos Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction Other studies have also questioned the orthodox view on bad quartos as in David FarleyHillss work on Romeo and Juliet

No account is taken in the bad quarto hypothesis that throughout Shakespeares working lifetime stage plays for public performance were controlled by law and could not be performed unless registered with and granted a performance licence by the Lord Chamberlain of England on behalf of the Monarch This was a matter of public order to control the content of plays with the aim of preventing the uttering of sedition or treason on the stage such as had led in the past to rioting in the streets This licensing system was strictly enforced at least in London near the heart of the Royal government but it is impossible to reconcile it with the concept of pirate productions of any play being permitted let alone with the idea that a hypothetical pirate theatre company would be allowed to print and sell its playscripts  the socalled bad quartos  without being forcibly put out of business by the militia But failure to allow for the powers of the Chamberlain to close theatres at the Monarchs will really renders the essence of the bad quarto hypothesis defunct

In 1996 Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study of the concept of memorial reconstruction based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the BBC TV Shakespeare series broadcast in the early 1980s 

She found that actors typically add drop or invert single words But the largerscale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos The study uncovered only limited circumstantial evidence suggestive of possible memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of Hamlet The Merry Wives of Windsor and Pericles

In fact according to Maguire virtually all the socalled bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts which merit our attention as valid texts in their own right This challenges the entire concept of bad quartos as pirated editions mired in textual corruption and presents them rather as earlier versions of the plays printed in the 1623 folio

Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts scholars have also applied it to nonShakespearean play texts of the English Renaissance era 

In 1938 Leo Kirschbaum published A Census of Bad Quartos and included 20 play texts Maguires 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and nonShakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos including the first editions of Arden of Feversham The Merry Devil of Edmonton and Fair Em plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha plus George Chapmans The Blind Beggar of Alexandria Christopher Marlowes Doctor Faustus and The Massacre at Paris Part 1 of Heywoods If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody and Beaumont and Fletchers The Maids Tragedy

Hurst increased his public profile in early 1991 when he emerged as a prominent opponent of Canadian Broadcasting Corporations decision to shut down its Windsorarea news department He was quoted as saying Were bombarded by American culture here and the CBC was something that really helped keep us Canadian

Hurst supported a relaxation of Canadas Sunday shopping laws for communities on the American border arguing that this step would counter the effects of crossborder shopping on the local economy He opposed a restrictive shopping law brought forward by the province of Ontario in early 1991

Hurst was elected Mayor of Windsor in the 1991 municipal election defeating local magazine publisher Jerry Woloschuk The incumbent mayor John Millson did not seek reelection in order to spend more time with his family Hurst renewed his opposition to Sunday shopping legislation after the election and indicated that he might attempt to circumvent the law through legal means He welcomed a 1992 ruling by the Ontario Municipal Board which allowed Sunday shopping in much of Windsor to promote tourism

Hurst announced in 1992 that he would support the construction of a casino for Windsor to be built by private enterprise and leased to the province He argued that fifty million Americans lived within driving distance of the city and that a casino would greatly improve the citys threatened economy The plan was accepted by the provincial government of Bob Rae and casino operations were opened to the public in 1994 Despite concerns about the longterm viability of a casinocentred economy the project encountered relatively little organized opposition from the local community

On opening night in 1994 Hurst proclaimed These are momentous days for Windsor Windsor is a city of hope One year later with the casino generating strong revenues he said Its changed the city forever The permanent Casino Windsor building was opened in 1998

Hurst also made several efforts to build a new arena in downtown Windsor although these plans were beset with various delays In the late 1990s he championed a successful plan to construct an office tower complex for Chrysler Canada Ltd

Hurst criticized the provincial government in April 1993 for cancelling a plan to relocate government jobs from Toronto to other communities The Rae government had planned to decentralize the public sector after coming to office but was forced to change its plans in the face of a serious recession

In 1997 Hurst criticized the provincial government of Mike Harris who succeeded Rae as premier in 1995 for introducing a bill to give the province extensive powers over public sector unions He argued that it was unhelpful and unnecessarily confrontational He also criticized the governments downloading of provincial services to the municipalities arguing that the municipalities lost money from the arrangement Hurst was himself asked to run for Harriss Progressive Conservative Party in a 1997 byelection but declined

In 1999 Hurst accused provincial cabinet minister Steve Gilchrist of putting himself in a conflictofinterest situation by suggesting his personal lawyer as a government contact Hurst says that he rejected the offer outright Gilchrist denied having seriously made the offer Hurst later indicated that he would not enforce the Harris governments laws against panhandling In 2003 he commended Harriss successor Ernie Eves for promising to invest 625 million over five years in the auto sector

Hurst also welcomed the return of Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operations to Windsor in 1993

The Windsor City Council voted to license escort services in 1996 as a means of providing legal protection for vulnerable sextrade workers Hurst opposed the licensing law although he later acknowledged that it did not generate any complaints

In 2002 two city employees were fired over allegations of misleading council over lease agreements with MFP Financial Services One of the employees was also accused of accepting personal benefits from MFP Hurst was strongly critical of the companys role in the matter

Later in the same year Hurst threatened to call a state of emergency if the provincial and federal governments did not look into the issue of Americanboard trucks causing gridlock in the city There were reports that urban gridlock was promoting an economic downturn for the community

Hurst was reelected in 1994 1997 and 2000 each time by a significant margin

Hurst supported a controversial Detroit River Tunnel Partnership plan near the end of his final term and he was hired as chief executive officer of the partnerships Jobs Tunnel project in January 2004 He was fiftythree years old at the time In 2011 Hurst was named a Justice of the Peace and works out of the Provincial Court in Windsor Ontario

ESPN Classic European TV channel
ESPN Classic was a Britishbased European sports television channel which first launched in France in March 2002 followed by Italy in July 2002 and panEurope in December 2003 On 13 March 2006 ESPN Classic launched on Sky channel 442 in the UK and Ireland the first channel in the UK under the ESPN branding On 3 August 2009 ESPN Classic launched on Virgin Media channel 533 as a part of the XL pack and in early 2011 video on demand content started to appear on the Virgin Media platform On 14 August 2009 ESPN Classic launched on UPC Ireland channel 409 as a part of the Max package It broadcast a range of archive sports coverage with a large emphasis on football

On 25 February 2013 BT Group agreed to acquire ESPNs UK and Ireland TV channels business consisting of ESPN and ESPN America the value of the deal was not disclosed but BT is understood to have paid low tens of millions ESPN Classic which was not part of the BT deal ceased transmission on satellite across Europe the Middle East and Africa at midnight on 1 August 2013

Much of the channels output was football This included action from the Premier League FA Cup matches European Cup European Cup Winners Cup and League Cup finals and some England games ESPN Classic also showed games from the FIFA World Cup following a multiyear deal to show 150 classic FIFA World Cup matches from 1930 to 2006 Though most coverage on the channel was from the colour era it had shown original blackandwhite footage of European Cup finals going back as far as 1959

A significant proportion of the football action on ESPN Classic was archive ITV football coverage including matches covered by regional ITV companies However much of the football seen on the channel was not shown with the original commentary Instead many games especially the Premier League and FA Cup games tended to feature commentary dubbed on more recently by Jon Champion and Paul Dempsey or commentary by Sky Sports broadcasters such as Martin Tyler and Alan Parry which seemed to be from the international feed of the time Similarly the footage from games where commentary was later added did not include original onscreen captions with ESPN adding captions themselves Some 1960s European Cup finals also had a new commentary dubbed on by Tony Jones 

The channel also showed some rugby union international matches including action from the Rugby World Cup as well as past matches from the rugby union Premiership Other sports featured included cricket ESPNproduced vintage boxing matches The Ultimate Fighter and more recently action from American sports to complement the live American sports action which was broadcast on ESPN and ESPN America 

In addition to the programmes mentioned above ESPN Classic had made a variety of other programmes These included Sports Years as well as many football compilation programmes In addition to mark the 30th anniversary of ESPN the channel showed the ESPN Films 30 for 30 series

ESPN Classic regularly repeated the sporting action that it showed on the channel with the same material often being shown time and time again Some of the action especially ESPNproduced programmes and series had been broadcast on the channel on dozens of different occasions

During the first three years of the channel sporting action from the BBC was featured extensively However this deal expired in mid 2009 and was seemingly not renewed as for the next eighteen months the channel did not feature any sport produced by the BBC Therefore sports such as rugby league golf athletics darts and snooker were not shown on the channel nor were events such as domestic cricket prior to 1999 the year that the BBC lost the rights to show live cricket Wimbledon tennis the Olympic Games and football coverage to which the BBC had the exclusive rights which had included showings of 1970s and 1980s editions of Match of the Day under the title of The Dead Good Match with the opening and closing titles removed and some editions were truncated with only one of the matches covered in a particular programme being shown One exception had been BBCproduced coverage of rugby unions Five Nations tournament shown during the 2011 Six Nations Championship 

In March 2011 a new deal between ESPN and the BBC was signed which provided ESPN Classic with access to around 80 hours of footage However this was far less than under the previous agreement which had given the channel access to around 630 hours The new deal meant that previous ESPNproduced programmes based on the BBC archive such as the darts series Bellies and Bullseyes were once again shown on the channel along with new programmes such as athletics series Solid Gold  Team GB and other oneoff programmes such as a compilation of top Grand Nationals This new deal with BBC Sport coincided with a new look for the channel the first new look since ESPN UK launched in summer 2009

ESPN Classic occasionally showed live action when two events to which ESPN has the rights took place at the same time The first live sport that the channel showed was two UEFA Europa League matches on 29 September and 20 October 2011 The first of the two games was Maribor and Birmingham 

On 9 January 2012 the channel broadcast the third evening of the BDO World Darts Championship because the main channel was showing a third round match from the FA Cup This happened again a year later when for the same reason ESPN Classic again showed the third evenings action

On 5 May 2012 ESPN Classic broadcast two live events  the final day of rugby unions Premiership league season and a football match from Serie A This was due to the main channel showing live coverage of the FA Cup Final

On 1 September 2012 ESPN Classic showed a live rugby union match from the Aviva Premiership because the main network was broadcasting its weekly match from footballs Premier League The same happened two weeks later although the clash this time was due to the main channel showing the Scottish Premier League

On 20 and 22 September 2012 ESPN Classic showed live coverage of the European Darts Championship because the main channel was showing the
UEFA Europa League and the Aviva Premiership respectively The following day Sunday 23rd ESPN swapped its coverage with the darts being shown on the main channel with much of its traditional Sunday fare of European league football plus another Aviva Premiership match airing on Classic

On 4 May 2013 ESPN Classic was used to provide coverage of a second game from the final set of league matches of the 201213 Aviva Premiership season

Pease River
The Pease River is a river in Texas in the United States it is a tributary of the Red River that runs in an easterly direction through West Texas  It was discovered and mapped for the first time in 1856 by Jacob de Crdova who found the river while surveying for the Galveston Houston and Henderson Railroad Company it was named after Texas Governor Elisha M Pease In December 1860 the Texas Rangers recaptured Cynthia Ann Parker and her daughter from the Comanche Indians at an engagement along the river

The river begins northeast of Paducah in northern Cottle County and runs eastward for to its mouth on the Red River northeast of Vernon Its course flows through floodprone flat terrain with local shallow depressions surfaced by sandy and clay loams part of it forms the county line between Hardeman and Foard counties

The river has three main branches the North Pease Middle Pease and Tongue or South Pease rivers the beginning of the main river is variously given as where all three branches come together or where only the North and Middle Pease Rivers intersect Satellite and topographical imagery however clearly shows that the Tongue River empties into the Middle Pease before the latters meeting with the North Pease

The North Pease rises southeast of Cedar Hill on the Caprock Escarpment in eastern Floyd County and runs through Motley Hall and Cottle before meeting the Middle Pease River It begins at and descends over  cutting a wide sandy bed through mostly flat terrain most of the area through which it passes is remote ranchland

The Middle Pease river rises northwest of Matador at the confluence of Mott and Boggy Creeks in western Motley County it flows about for in an eastward direction before joining the North Pease in northeastern Cottle County It runs through flat isolated ranch territory the only settlement ever established on its banks was the nowghost of Tee Pee City The state has established a region called the Matador Wildlife Management area along its course in northwestern Cottle County

The Tongue River or South Pease River was named allegedly named for the Black Tongue a 19thcentury disease that killed many area buffalo It rises west of Roaring Springs in southwestern Motley County and flows east and northeast through rugged ranch and canyonland The geographic feature of Roaring Spring not to be confused with the town downstream from the rivers source was a popular gathering place for Indians cowboys and others A ranch club is now located near the spring where State Highway 70 crosses the river

<doc id="7704848" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7704848" title="Andalusian chicken">
Andalusian chicken
The Andalusian or Blue Andalusian  is a breed of domestic chicken indigenous to the autonomous community of Andalusia in southwest Spain It is distributed through much of the countryside of Crdoba and Seville and is concentrated particularly in the area of Utrera which is considered the heartland of the breed In 2009 the population was estimated at 10000 birds

A very different type of Andalusian more intensely blue and with bluelaced plumage was created in England from birds imported from Andalusia through selective breeding and crossbreeding with birds of other breeds

There is little information on the early history of the Andalusian Blue chickens from Andalusia were imported to England no later than 1851 The creation of the international type of Andalusian with bluelaced plumage is attributed to the English whether in Andalusia or in Britain Two breeders in particular are thought to have started this process which took many years one named Coles from Fareham Hampshire and a certain John Taylor of Shepherds Bush in west London Another claimant was Augusta Legge who was the countess of Dartmouth Andalusians were shown at Baker Street London in January 1853 they were not included in the original Standard of Excellence in 1865

Andalusians reached the United States in about 185055 and were included in the first edition of the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874 The breed arrived in South America in 1870 and was first shown in Germany in the same year A bantam was created in the 1880s

The slateblue plumage of the Andalusian is caused by a dilution gene which in combination with the E gene for black plumage produces partial dilution of the melanin which gives the black colour Not all Andalusians are blue birds with two copies of the gene have neartotal dilution and are offwhite birds with no copies have no dilution and are black those with one copy have partial dilution and are blue Blue birds occur in Mendelian proportion twice as often as each of the other colours All are present in the population

The earlobes of the Andalusian are smooth white and almondshaped the crest is single and of medium size with five welldefined points The skin is white and the legs and feet are black

Andaluza Azul hens lay about 165 white eggs per year eggs weigh Bluebred white hens lay the largest eggs

Bacchus opera
Bacchus is an opera in four acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Catulle Mends after Greek mythology It was first performed at the Palais Garnier in Paris on 5 May 1909

The story is based on the mythology surrounding Bacchus and Ariadne Ariane The Gods among them demigod Bacchus appear in human form in ancient India to attempt to persuade the people away from the pervading Buddhist influence Ariane has followed them convinced that Bacchus is in fact Theseus her unrequited love In the end Ariane sacrifices herself to save humanity and in doing so Bacchus becomes a God

Although not a proper sequel as Ariane dies in both pieces Bacchus is a companion to Massenets earlier opera Ariane Of Massenets twentyfive operas Bacchus is probably the least known without a modern performance history or single modern recording of even an excerpt 

The story of this opera is also related to that of Ariadne auf Naxos from Richard Strauss

Steve Johnson and Kayla Brady
Steve Patch Earl Johnson and Dr Kayla Caroline Brady are a supercouple on the American soap opera Days of Our Lives Steve is portrayed by Stephen Nichols and Kayla is portrayed by Mary Beth Evans On the Internet message boards5 the couple is often referred to by the portmanteau Stayla for Steve and Kayla The couple was initially popular from 1986 through 1990 until the death of Steve Both characters have recently returned after Steve being presumed dead for 16 years Steve returned to the show on June 9 2006 Kayla returned on June 12 2006 Steve and Kayla were dropped off canvas in February 2009 Kayla returned in December 2011 In August 2015 Steve returned to Salem and the couple reunited soon after

Steve Johnson was a former Merchant Marine who came to Salem working as a mercenary He had a vendetta against his former best friend Bo Brady Kaylas brother who had gouged out his eye during a fight long ago His bad boy image and criminal actions were no match for the beautiful good girl Kayla Brady One night he rescued her from a street gang and left a note with his number on her car and eventually the two fell in love

Kayla pushed Steve away but he was undeterred He kept trying to convince her that they were meant to be together Kaylas family were opposed to the pairing most especially Bo Brady who believed Steve to be dangerous Steve received an incredible shock when his sister came to town Adrienne had been born after Steves mother had brought Steve and baby Billy to an orphanage Steve had been 5 Billy had been a young baby Jo Johnson Steves mother was afraid her husband Duke would kill the children or vice versa due to Dukes extremely violent nature Steve wanted nothing to do with Adrienne or Jo but deep down he was yearning for the mother he had loved and hoped to see again

Duke ended up raping his virgin daughter Adrienne when she refused to tell him where to find her mother She shot him in selfdefense when he staggered over to her to do it again and then she blocked out the memory of the rape and the killing Steve tried to take the blame and developed a strong protectiveness towards his sister Adrienne remembered what had happened just in time during the trial and Steve was exonerated He started to push Kayla even further away blaming her at first for not letting him kill Duke when he had had a chance before the rape and then fearing that he would be just like Duke after his mother angrily told her children that Duke hadnt always been so bad when they confronted her on her decision to ever hook up with a man like him She told Steve that Steve reminded her of Duke in many ways not realizing how painful those words would be

Their relationship would be challenged by the news that Steve had a wife While taken aback and hurt by the news Kayla continued the relationship Then Kaylas boyfriend Jack shows up Jack is madly in lovely with Kayla but Kayla does not return the feelings Jack hopefully pursued Kayla because he thought eventually he would win her over The Deveraux Family hired Kayla to be Jacks private nurse when he was diagnosed with Hodgkins Disease and quite ill Steve learned the truth that Jack was his own brother Billy When he did he shunned Kayla hoping she would end up with Jack so his brother would have someone special with whom to spend his seemingly final days Believing Steve was no longer interested in her Kayla accepted a marriage proposal from Jack

Jack now played by Matthew Ashford recovered but Kayla rebuffed every one of his attempts to consummate the marriage unable to let her love for Steve go Jack assumed Kayla was just nervous because they didnt know each other all that well He knew she didnt love him suspected that there were still feelings between Steve and Kayla but he still remained hopeful that she would someday love him

Months later Steve discovered Kayla was being poisoned Suspecting it to be someone in the Deveraux house and heartbroken that it could be his baby brother he kidnapped her and the two almost made love They carried on their affair in secret Kayla wanted to get out of her marriage but Jo and Steve begged her to wait until Jacks political election had passed On New Years EveDay Jack planned a romantic evening for them and Kayla feigned illness so she and Steve could be together that night A photographer snapped pictures of them kissing on New Years Eve while at the same time a disconsolate Jack was searching for his wife at a party to do the new years countdown together Worried what they were doing was wrong the two said a heartfelt goodbye something they would do over and over again

A few weeks later Jack won the political election and an unscrupulous reporter gave him the compromising pictures intending to blackmail him Enraged by her behavior and believing that Kayla and Steve had deliberately set out to hurt him Jack confronted Kayla and angrily raped her Steve discovered this fought his brother and nearly killed him when Jack fell off the roof where they were fighting In the aftermath as Jack suffered from failing kidneys Steve donated one of his own to save his brothers life Jack resented  and even harassed  Steve and Kayla but the revelation that he was Steves brother and that his own father Harper had been a serial killer who had tried to poison Kayla would change his life eventually for the better

Steve saved Kayla from Harper once more but Kayla ended up losing her ability to speak following surgery to repair her hearing When Jack discovered that Kayla was deaf and that part of the reason she was deaf was the stresses in her life including his own violent behavior he sadly granted her a divorce

Steve learned to use sign language to communicate with her Kaylas speech returned on her wedding day when she said I do to marrying Steve

A couple of years later Steves supposedly dead wife Marina resurfaced She wanted to get back together with Steve but instead asked for his help in finding a special key A pregnant Kayla thought it was the best thing to do in the hopes Marina would grant Steve a divorce so they could truly be married Marina had every intent of rekindling things with Steve but Jack who was now well on his way to reforming did his level best to bring Steve and Kayla back together despite Steve and Kaylas insistence that he stay away from them

After going all the way to Italy and back Marina ended up dead and Kayla was accused of the murder Due to doctored videotape evidence Kayla was sentenced to prison for ten years She gave birth to a daughter Stephanie who Steve would raise while Kayla was in prison However a deranged nanny kidnapped Stephanie Kayla escaped prison and she and Steve followed the kidnapper to Australia where along with Bo and Hope they were able to recover their baby Now a newspaper man Jack Deveraux worked with Jennifer Horton his employee and future wife to help push public opinion Kaylas way and help find out who really killed Marina The evidence against Kayla was soon discovered to be a fraud when Isabella Marinas sister remembered that she had killed her sister during a violent altercation and Kayla was allowed to return to Salem a free woman

Steve and Kayla were married again in 1990 this time with Jack Deveraux as best man The incident with Marina had changed his relationship with Steve and Kayla and Steve was tentatively trying to welcome his brother into his life Kayla while always uncomfortable around Jack tried to make peace with their past and allow the relationship to grow between the brothers

Tragedy would strike however when Steve was caught in an explosion aboard Bo Bradys boat It was no accident the explosion was meant to kill Bo and was planned by the evil oil baron Lawrence Alamain Steve survived the blast but because he thought Steve had evidence against him Lawrence had Steves IV poisoned With a griefstricken Kayla at his side Steve died However an empty coffin was buried in his grave

Presumed dead after his car went into a river Jack Deveraux was on his deathbed in a hospice He was awaiting death and refusing to let his wife Jennifer daughter Abigail and mother Jo know he was still alive hoping to spare them the agony of losing him yet again as he has died more than once A caring orderly tried to see if he wanted anything to eat or drink and a delirious Jack was shocked to see that it was his brother Steve Johnson Jack could not believe his eyes

Steve believed himself to be a man by the name of Nick Stockton but a DNA test proved otherwise Intrigued by the possibilities and driven by his brothers earnest pleadings that he return home he convinced Jack to return home as well

On the day of Jennifers wedding to Frankie Brady Steve and Jack arrived Everyone was shocked when Jack interrupted the ceremony Meanwhile overwhelmed by the pain of returning to Salem where she had enjoyed such a short time of joy with Steve Kayla was crying at Steves graveside at the cemetery at the church unable to sit through the wedding without breaking down

Suddenly Steve approached her from behind asking her if she was okay The shock of seeing her long lost love caused Kayla to faint but when she awoke her wildest dreams were confirmed Steve has returned

Kayla was overjoyed and has tried not to pressure Steve who is clearly suffering from amnesia He has shared the memories he does have but continually tells Kayla he has no memory of her Kayla and Steve have spent a lot of time together trying to stir up memories she explained to him why the sky was blue and the meaning of emc2 but upon a visit to Cincinnati Ohio  Nick Stocktons old stomping grounds  it appeared as though Steve was giving up on those missing memories and on Kayla She returned to Salem and Steve would almost immediately follow her Steves daughter Stephanie also proved to be a great draw for him as the young woman joyfully welcomed her thoughtdead father into her life

Steve began to push Kayla away again trying instead to make a love connection with Billie Reed whom he thought to be more like himself than the classy Dr Kayla Brady At the same time his brother Jack made a complete recovery and left with wife and son to head up the London Spectator news office Jack begged his brother to give his love with Kayla a chance telling him that Kayla and Steve were meant to be together which was full circle from the times he tried to tear them apart Having no memories of his darker past with his brother Steve was moved and affected by the younger mans words and outpouring of brotherly affection but he still could not make the move towards a life with Kayla

His daughter roundly scolded him for bringing Billie with him to watch her race she races cars and Steve blamed himself when Stephanie was critically injured during the race Tearfully at her bedside he had a flashback to holding her as a baby He still doesnt remember Kayla but now he remembers Stephanie and hes terrified of how much it hurts to love her especially as she lies near deaths door

Steve and Kayla were poisoned by a biotoxin a month later in November 2006 Steve recovered but Kayla hovering near death fell into a coma Steve pretended to get his memory back with the help of notes of his history with Kayla provided by Bo and Hope to give her the will to carry on it worked and Kayla woke up weak but responsive Before John and Marlena could get back from Canada with the antidote for Kayla she flatlined and Steve became hysterical he lifted her up and gave her a long kiss and miraculously her heart started to beat again John and Marlena got to the hospital the antidote was administered and Kayla began to recover

After Kayla was released from the hospital Steve remained by her side but was distant because of her fragile stillrecovering state he was hesitant to tell her that his memory had not really returned However Kayla suspected the truth as he was distant To find out for certain she asked Steve to take a trip with her to the bungalow where they had hid from Victor Kiriakis nearly two decades earlier she wanted to test his memory there Steve not knowing that Kayla suspected the truth reluctantly agreed

Once at the bungalow Steve decided to tell Kayla the truth his memory did not return and he remembered a life with a separate family a different wife and daughter However he cared about Kayla and he was just determined to keep Kayla alive and wanted to give her the will to live Heartbroken but strong Kayla surprised Steve by telling him that she had already knew that this was the case She excused herself going to another room to silently cry Steve promptly fell asleep on the bed and began to have flashes of memories and dreams of Kayla Waking up in the middle of a dream he thought that he and Kayla were on the run from Victor Kiriakis something that had happened nearly 20 years prior Entering the room Kayla was in he frantically vowed to protect her as Kayla shocked didnt understand what was going on The flashes of memory became more intense and Steve with Kayla holding on to him in an attempt to snap him out of his erratic state fell catching his breath he realized Kayla could be the love of his life his memory had returned telling Kayla tearfully I remember loving you

Kayla was skeptical but Steve at first was oblivious he was so overjoyed at having his memory back trying to tell her every memory at once He soon noticed that she was crying and was shocked asking her what was wrong Kayla replied that she didnt know if she could believe that he had really gotten his memory back especially not after how he had previously pretended to remember her Horrified Steve grabbed her and assured her that he Steven Earl Johnson her oneeyed tomcat was indeed back Overcome Kayla ran out of the bungalow crying with Steve chasing her Coming back she nearly faintedstill recovering from the biotoxin poisoningand he caught her holding her close and assuring her that everything would be fine

After more desperate pleas from Steve to believe in him and after he signed courage to her as he did on their wedding day Kayla relented they reunited passionately

Over the next year 2007 Steve and Kayla would overcome the consequences of Steves brainwashing by Stefano DiMera who had used him as a pawn Kayla deprogrammed him after several months of pain and terror

That summer Steve would act as a gobetween for the DiMera family and the Bradys as he attempted to discover what the DiMeras were up to by infiltrating their mansion as an undercover agent Also around this time Kayla began thinking about adopting a child so she and Steve could experience raising one together Kayla was working at the hospital when she discovered an abandoned baby boy there and instantly fell in love with him With some convincing Steve agreed that they would become the foster parents of the baby boy nicknamed Pocket by Kayla After a couple of months however Pocket began getting sick and had to be hospitalized During this time Philip Kiriakis discovered he had a son an invitro baby with Mimi Lockhart Steve Kayla and Philip all learned that Pocket was really Philip and Mimis son whose real name was Tyler and who had been abandoned by the surrogate who gave birth to him In the end a young couple who had been caring for the baby after he was taken away from Steve and Kayla expressed a desire to adopt him and Steve and Kayla though heartbroken to lose the little boy agreed that the child would be well off with the adoptive parents as did Philip

Steve and Kayla then had to deal with the rape of their daughter Stephanie by Ford Decker who afterwards died in an accidental fall

In February 2008 Kayla learned that she was pregnant with the couples second child

Ando Masahashi
James Kyson who portrays Ando had to audition several times for the role and recounted the entire process of his being selected in an interview with BuddyTV

Ahmed Diraige
Ahmad Ibrahim Diraige is the former governor of the Sudanese province of Darfur and current head of the National Redemption Front alliance of rebel groups in the Darfur conflict He currently resides in the United Kingdom

Diraige is a Fur born to a shartai paramount chief In December 1963 as a young politician he created the Darfur Development Front DDF to create a common agenda to advocate for the regions interests However he proved unable to bring all the provincial interests into a common front Although the Front was popular from its creation with Fur because of its founders ethnic connections it was open to all Darfuris its name suggesting that development should be the primary concern of political action By the time of the February 1968 election the politics had become ethnically polarized between rival factions of the Umma Party Sadiq alMahdi calculating that the provinces demographics favored the African tribes successfully courted the DDF leaving Imam alHadi to mobilize the Arab vote Sadiqs faction won 13 of 24 seats while the faction led by alHadi received seven The factions were reconciled only when the parliamentary government was overthrown by the military coup of Col Gaafar Nimeiry in May 1969 Both Diraige and alSadiq were arrested while alHadi was executed

In 1979 Darfuris rioted after their province became the only one in which the governor alTayeb alMardi was not locally chosen Nimeiry had chosen alTayeb alMardi to oversee the support to the Chadian guerilla force led by Hissne Habr but grew concerned that he was losing control of the situation In January 1980 he dismissed alTayeb alMardi and appointed Diraige The appointment of the DDR leader resulted in an immediate lessening of tensions Diraige refused to accept a salary and quickly concentrated on replacing posts filled due to political patronage with largely apolitical civil servants from across the ethnic spectrum who had all been affiliated with the DDF since 1964 The many problems facing the provincial government including rising racial tensions the accumulated administrative neglect and spillover from the conflict in Chad was soon superseded by steadily diminishing rains In the 1981 provincial elections ethnicity had become a dominant political factor and Diraige with his large Fur base of support and long out of jail easily won the governorship His election in turn sparked plans by Darfuri Arabs to join with the Zaghawa and Fellata and form an Arab Alliance

The Diraige government soon realized that they could not dig water boreholes quickly enough to make up for the lowered amount of rainfall In November 1983 Diraige wrote a letter to Nimeiry warning him that unless foreign food aid was requested Darfur faced a serious famine This letter would come to be known as the famine letter Since 1977 Nimeiry had been creating an image of Sudan as the future breadbasket of the Arab world was furious with Diraige for sending this inconvenient letter and refused to respond On 23 December 1983 Diraige flew to Khartoum to present his case in person Nimeiry made his displeasure clear and stated that he would not ask for aid An arrest warrant for Diraige was issued about 48 hours later which he escaped by flying to Saudi Arabia By August 1984 the existence of the famine was obvious and Nimeiry was forced to declare Darfur a disaster zone The story of Diraige the first locally accountable governor who had been forced into exile for warning of a preventable famine became widely known further aggravating tensions between Darfur and the northernerdominated government

By 1987 the situation had worsened The LibyaChad War overflowed into the province resulting in widespread violence Many Fur military conscripts fighting the Second Sudanese Civil War deserted to the side of the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army SPLA Sudanese Brig Fadlallah Burma Nasir and Chief of Staff Brig Fawzi Ahmed elFadl visited Diraige at his home in London asking if he would come back and support the government to stop the desertion of Fur soldiers Diraige refused In the late 1980s Darfuri politician Daud Bolad sought help from the SPLA in extending the rebellion to Darfur Other leftist leaders such as Diraige believed that the SPLA would use them for its own purpose and intentionally did not associate themselves with the southern rebels Bolads capture in 1991 and the destruction of his resistance network was seen as confirmation that this was the correct stance

Diraige created the Sudan Federal Democratic Alliance SFDA a member organization of the opposition National Democratic Alliance From 1996 SFDA deputy Sharif Harir set up an office in Asmara Eritrea from which it actively recruited armed fighters from migrant Darfuris On 23 January 2004 Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Taha met Diraige in Nairobi while ostensibly on hajj break from talks in Naivasha ending the war in the south Diraige used his personal credibility to get the Darfuri rebels to agree to talks on humanitarian matters in Geneva to be mediated by the Henri Dunant Foundation as a trustbuilding first step The government then broke Diraiges trust by publicly demanding a meeting on national reconciliation in Khartoum This had been the last line of communication that the government still had with the Fur rebels In 2003 the Darfur Liberation Front a new rebel group fighting a steadily escalating conflict asked the SFDA for political and logistical support Harir agreed and declared that the DLF fighters were the military wing of the SFDA However Diraige disagreed that this was the time for armed rebellion and the DLF got no substantive support

This position apparently changed In June 2006 Diraige was named the head of the National Redemption Front a coalition of the SFDA Justice and Equality Movement and the faction of the Sudan Liberation Army SLA that had not signed the May deal taken by the faction of the SLA led by Minni Minnawi

Jeek
Jeek the Baby Jesus is a cultural Christmas figure popular in the Czech Republic It is also known as Jeiko in Slovakia Jezuek in Slovenia and as Jzuska in Hungary

There is no accurate description of Jeek He has been depicted as a baby toddler and young lad Some even consider him simply as an abstract figure According to tradition Jeek makes his appearance on Christmas Eve After families have the traditional Czech dinner of carp potato salad carp soup or pea soup family with children go to some room and watch the sky and look out for Jeek Meanwhile someone rings a bell After that children run to a room where there are already presents In some families Jeek also sets up a Christmas tree In others parents buy a tree and the whole family decorates it Young children open their gifts on 24 December

The tradition of Jeek has been observed by the Czechs for more than 400 years This is partly due to the large population of Catholics during that period It was Martin Luther who coined the term during the 16th century an attempt to provide a suitable name to their figure other than St Nicholas

During the 1950s the Communist regime was largely promoting Dda Mraz Ded Moroz over Jeek but Czech families didnt go for it 

In 1989 after the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the communist regime local entrepreneurs began introducing Santa Claus to the country He appeared in shop windows and town gatherings Czech children were surprised to learn that their toys were given to them by an old man instead of the figure they grew up with Despite the growing presence of Santa Claus Jeek continues to be a popular tradition

In December 1996 80 Santa Clauses held a rally at the heart of traditional Prague in another attempt to make the Western figure popular with the children It had moderate success which eventually paved the way for Zachrate Jekas petition to actively protect local Christmas traditions

At present belief in Jeek is upheld in modern Czech society despite having the lowest rates of religious affiliation in the world

Thomas Shuldham OHalloran
Thomas Shuldham OHalloran 25 October 1797  16 August 1870 was the first Police Commissioner and first Police Magistrate of South Australia

OHalloran was born in Berhampore now Baharampur India the second of eight sons of MajorGeneral Sir Joseph OHalloran by his wife Frances daughter of Colonel Nicholas Bayly MP and niece of Henry 1st Earl of Uxbridge Thomas was a grandson of Irish surgeon Sylvester OHalloran and brother to William Littlejohn OHalloran

OHalloran entered the Royal Military College Sandhurst or Marlow in 1808 and at 16 he was commissioned into the 17th Foot and sailed for India He served in the Nepal war during the years 1814 1815 and 1816 became Lieutenant in June 1817 and served in the Deccan war during that and the following year On 1 August 1821 he married Miss Anne Goss of Dawlish Devonshire who died in 1823 in Calcutta leaving two children In 1822 he exchanged from the 17th to the 44th Regiment which he joined in Calcutta in January 1823 In 1824 he was ordered with the left wing of the 44th to Chittagong where he arrived early in June and was appointed paymaster quartermaster and interpreter On 30 October he was appointed brigademajor to BrigadierGeneral Dunkin CB who commanded the Sylket division of the army during the Burmese war and served on his staff until his death in Nov 1825 He received a medal for war service in India for Nepal and Ava

OHalloran transferred to the 99th Foot as a Captain in 1827 He returned to England after twenty years in India in 1834 On 10 July 1834 he married Miss Jane Waring of Newry County Down and retired on halfpay in October of that year Soon afterwards he transferred to the Coldstream Guards and was on half pay until he transferred again to the 97th Foot in May 1837

In 1838 OHalloran retired from the army by the sale of his commission and sailed for South Australia the same year with his family in the Rajahstan landing at Glenelg on 21 November 1838 He established a farm Lizard Lodge in the Adelaide suburb which now bears his name OHalloran Hill He was made a JP in 1839 He was gazetted MajorCommandant of the South Australian Militia on 26 February 1840 and on 8 June as Commissioner of Police

In December 1839 he was appointed by George Gawler as one of four members of a Board of Police Commissioners Upon the dismissal of the founder and first commander of the police Superintendent Henry Inman in May 1840 the Board was abolished and OHalloran was appointed under a new title of Police Commissioner He retired from Government service in 1843 as a result of his disinclination to serve as both Police Commissioner and Police Magistrate

In June 1840 the brig Maria set sail from Port Adelaide towards Hobart By July 1840 stories and rumours had circulated that all 26 people on board had survived a shipwreck but had been murdered by members of the Ngarrindjeri along the Coorong After a police investigation which discovered some of the bodies and determined who the murderers were believed to be Governor Gawler ordered OHalloran as police commissioner and Police Inspector Alexander Tolmer to lead a party of police and sailors to the area His orders were to find and execute those responsible

On 22 August 1840 after several days of interviews investigations and a drumhead courtmartial two Ngarrindjeri men were publicly hanged on the Coorong in front of 65 people from their tribe OHalloran then told the people through an interpreter that their bodies were not to be taken down and that this was to be a warning against violence towards Europeans by Aboriginal people

This was one of the most contentious incidents in South Australian legal history At the time Aboriginals in South Australia were considered British subjects and therefore deemed to be under the protection of British law Gawlers ordering of a drumhead courtmartial and the executions was not well received by the London authorities and contributed to his removal as governor

At that same time OHallorans younger brother Captain later Major General Henry Dunn OHalloran 180071 69th Regt posted at New Brunswick Canada was conducting a significant study of the language and customs of the indigenous Mikmaq people httparchivesgnbcaAssociatesNewsletters200622springepdf

Responsible Care
Started in Canada in 1985 Responsible Care is a global voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry for the chemical industry It runs in 67 countries whose combined chemical industries account for nearly 90 of global chemical production 96 of the 100 largest chemical producers in the world have adopted Responsible Care

It stands for the chemical industrys desire to improve health safety and environmental performance

The signatory chemical companies agree to commit themselves to improve their performances in the fields of environmental protection occupational safety and health protection plant safety product stewardship and logistics as well as to continuously improve dialog with their neighbors and the public independent from legal requirements

As part of Responsible Care initiative the International Council of Chemical Associations introduced the Global Product Strategy in 2006

Critical analyses of Responsible Care have been done by Andrew King and Michael Lenox Michael Givel and Moffet Bregha and Middelkoop

Responsible Care was launched by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada formerly the Canadian Chemical Producers Association  CCPA in 1985 The scheme evolved and in 2006 The Responsible Care Global Charter was launched at the UNled International Conference on Chemicals Management in Dubai

Vernon Valley New York is a hamlet located in Suffolk County in the Township of Huntington It is located at the southeast corner of the incorporated Village of Northport and is in the Northport postal zone and is within the censusdesignated place of East Northport

The name is more generally applied to the entire hollow or valley that runs south from this point for approximately 15 miles to East Northport Not coincidentally the thoroughfare is named Vernon Valley Road The building which is now known as the St Pauls Lutheran School located near the southern terminus was originally built as The Vernon Valley Inn With the demise of that business the last reference other than the local street passed from common usage 

The location cited was originally known as Red Hook and was centered on what is now the intersection of NYS Route 25A Main Street Waterside Avenue and Vernon Valley Road When the village of Northport was incorporated in the late 1800s the northwest quadrant of the area fell within the new village limits

Abram Jr graduated from the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington in 1857 where he was a student of Prof Thomas Jonathan Stonewall Jackson as had been his elder brother Samuel Vance Fulkerson 18221862 who had served in the MexicanAmerican War and as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 According to VMI records Isaac Fulkerson had a reputation for being a prankster and wore an outlandish collar on his cadet uniform the collar being the only part of the uniform not covered under regulations After graduation he taught school in Palmyra Virginia then in 1860 in Rogersville Hawkins County Tennessee

Fulkerson entered Confederate military service in June 1861 as a Captain having organized a company of men from Hawkins County Tennessee that was mustered into the 19th Tennessee Infantry Regiment as Company K The Hawkins Boys at Knoxville Tennessee His was the first company of volunteers organized in East Tennessee and Abram Fulkerson received a commission as the regiments Major He was wounded in the thigh and his horse shot from under him at the Battle of Shiloh After recovery and the units reorganization he was reassigned to the 63rd Tennessee Infantry Commissioned as Lieutenant Colonel of the 63rd and President Jefferson Davis on February 12 1864 commissioned him as a full colonel

In January 1862 Abram Fulkerson received a furlough and went to Clarksville Tennessee and married his fianc Selina Johnson 18321918 on January 28 They were barely married in time to escape the Union Armys advance on Clarksville In June 1862 his brother Col Samuel Vance Fulkerson was killed in action leading the 37th Virginia Infantry at the Battle of Gaines Mill the first major victory of General Robert E Lee Another brother Isaac Fulkerson c 1829July 20 1889 was a captain in the 8th Texas Cavalry Terrys Texas Rangers

One of our pickets came in the other day and reported that a Mr Davis was at the lines and desired to enter This report took me very much by surprise for although you had mentioned the probability of his coming yet I did not look for him He only stayed a few hours After dinner a very poor one without apology to him I went around to show him some of the curiosities of Cumberland Gap which he seemed to think would compensate any one for making the visit He went back up the valley and expected to get home by Wednesday next

In the same letter he addressed the news of General Stonewall Jacksons death

The intelligence of the death of Gen Jackson came upon us like a shock We feel that his death is a national calamity The poorest soldiers among us appreciated his worth  loved the man and mourn his loss I knew him well1 He was my preceptor for more than four years and whilst during that time I did not appreciate the man as school schoolboysare not like to do yet I always had great reverence for the man on account of his piety  uprightness of character Among the many heroes of this revolution none have lived so much adored none have died so much deplored and none have left a character as spotless as that of Stonewall Jackson Could his life have been spared till the close of this cruel war the unanimous voice of a grateful people would have proclaimed him chief ruler of the nation But God has seen proper to take him from us and what He does is right and for the best It is illegible therefore that we make the sacrifice cheerfully tho we cannot see why our country should be deprived of his services at his her hour of greatest need

While in the 63rd Fulkerson was wounded twice more in the left arm at the Battle of Chickamauga and again at the Second Battle of Petersburg Virginia Battle of Petersburg II the regiment having been reassigned from the Army of Tennessee to the Army of Northern Virginia He was taken prisoner on June 17 1864 and sent to the POW camp at Fort Delaware

In addition to the training of officers in more than 20 areas of military education the school became the doctrine development center of the Air Corps and a preparatory school for Air Corps officers aspiring to attendance at the US Armys Command and General Staff College The motto of the Air Corps Tactical School was Proficimus More IrretentiWe Make Progress Unhindered by Custom

The Air Corps Tactical School was notable as the birthplace of the Army Air Forces doctrine of daylight precision bombing This doctrine held that a campaign of daylight air attacks against critical targets of a potential enemys industrial infrastructure using longrange bombers heavily armed for selfdefense could defeat an enemy nation even though its army and navy remained intact The Tactical School in formulating the doctrine rejected the idea of attacking civilians

Four former instructors of the school the core of a group known as the Bomber Mafia were grouped together in the Air War Plans Division to produce the two warwinning plansAWPD1 and AWPD42based on the doctrine of precision daylight bombing that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces

In a broader sense the strategic bombing doctrine adapted by factors encountered during combat was also the foundation for the final separation of the Air Force from the Army as a military service independent of and equal to the other services In 1946 the AAF created the Air University to carry on the work and traditions of the ACTS

At the end of World War I observation remained the main role of the Air Service However air combat and limited bombardment operations indicated to veterans of the Air Service including Brig Gen Billy Mitchell that while ideally the service should be separate from the Army it at the least should be centralized under an Air Service commander with some missions independent of direct support of troops In reorganizing the postwar Army the Armed Forces Reorganization Act of 1920 41 Stat 759 rebuked these ideas but did establish the Air Service as a statutory entity previously it had existed by executive order only and assigned it status as a combatant arm of the line

The Air Service followed the precedent of the other combat arms and began planning for its own service schools An Air Service School of Application for technical training in aeronautical engineering similar to the Ordnance School of Application at Sandy Hook New Jersey was set up at McCook Field and began its first class 10 November 1919 Maj Gen Charles Menoher Director of Air Service wrote the War Department in October 1919 for permission to establish a tactical school at Langley Field Virginia to train field grade officers in the operation and tactics of the Air Service as a requirement for higher command or staff work

On 25 February 1920 the War Department authorized the Air Service to establish its service schools In addition to six pilot and advanced pilot training schools and two technical training schools an Air Service School was planned It proposed to host courses for enlisted personnel as balloon observers balloon mechanics and aerial photography but its main course was to be the Field Officers Course

Major Thomas DeWitt Milling was assigned as officerincharge of the Field Officers Course at the new school and sent to Langley in July 1920 to set it up War Department General Order No 18 authorized the school on 14 August 1920 The balloon courses were split off into a separate school in a different area of Langley and the Air Service School was renamed the Air Service Field Officers School on 10 February 1921 after its primary function The Air Service ordered 17 officers to Langley eight as students and nine as instructors although several officers swapped roles and some instructors were students as well The 19201921 class opened on 1 November 1920 and although scheduled to last nine months was concluded in May when both students and instructors were assigned to the 1st Provisional Air Brigade as part of by the Air Service and the United States Navy 11 officers including four instructors graduated the first course The second class beginning in October 1921 was devoted to the further training of instructors the creation of a sound administrative system and development of a wellrounded course curriculum

In the first two classes despite the schools title and function only six of the first 23 graduates were field grade officers A board reviewing all service schools of the United States Army observed that the Field Officers School had a course load that in other branches of the Army was distributed among several schools Because all other Air Service schools were technical training in nature the board recommended that the school be opened to all air service officers regardless of rank Accordingly Army regulations changed the name of the school to that of Air Service Tactical School on 8 November 1922 With the passage of the Air Corps Act of 1926 the school again changed its name becoming the Air Corps Tactical School on 2 July 1926

While at Langley the ACTS was hampered by a chronic shortage of instructors caused by a lack of policy within the Army for filling vacancies despite a rapid turnover in staff in the first three years School administrators were forced to double as instructors The situation was somewhat ameliorated in August 1924 when the Chief of the Air Service authorized extended duty for instructors most of whom afterwards served fouryear tours on the faculty with an overlap between incoming and outgoing staff Between 1925 and 1929 the number of instructors gradually doubled to 16 but even that number proved insufficient to research the vast collection of aviation literature the schools library was collecting to establish doctrine

Despite school recommendations to the contrary class size gradually increased reaching 40 students by 1931 The first student from a branch other than the Air Service an infantry officer attended ASTS in 19231924 This became standard when the 19261927 class had five officers representing the other combat branches of the United States Army and three from the United States Marine Corps assigned as students

The functioning of the school was also handicapped by a lack of permanent facilities especially in quarters and the school did not have a permanent academic building When the fiveyear expansion program outlined in the Air Corps Act of 1926 failed to address these problems and the creation of new units at Langley interrupted the functioning of the practical flying course the Air Service began seeking a new location for the Tactical School

The 19301931 class was the last at Langley In its eleven years at Langley the Tactical School graduated 221 students

The academic curriculum was standardized in 1922 by the Armys board tasked with preparing programs of instruction for all Army schools 1345 hours of instruction in 20 subjects taught over a ninemonth period beginning on or about 1 September of each school year included approximately 900 hours of tactics including those of other services and combined arms tactics although more than half 480 hours were devoted to air tactics in observation bombardment pursuit and attack aviation Approximately 290 hours involved technical subjects including aeronautical engineering armament and gunnery navigation meteorology and photography and 150 to administrative studies covering staff duties combat orders organization of the Army military and international law supply and courses in equitation and stable management

The curriculum was altered in July 1923 by the newly created Director of Instruction Capt Earl Naiden cutting the academic course by 500 hours to 845 total hours 450 hours of the cuts came from the various tactics subjects although the equitation courses were also eliminated and all academic courses were scheduled in mornings Naiden added courses in the history of the Air Service and map reading to the academics and a 126hour afternoon course in practical flying instituted to provide refresher training to pilots but required of all students including those of nonaviation branches The course structure remained the same until 1939 with changes only in individual course subjects averaging 25 hours per week of classroom study and 37 hours weekly of flying

The first printed texts covering air tactics replaced mimeographed texts in 1924 This development of the tactics portion of the school led to increased emphasis and in 1925 aeronautical engineering was eliminated from the curriculum Theoretical use of airpower was first advanced in 1928 and beginning in 1929 a new course was taught at the end of each class The Air Force coordinating all air topics covered during the year

Army regulations also made the commander of the 2nd Wing as the base commander at Langley the commandant of the Tactical School However during its first four years this caused little disruption as Milling first as officer in charge and then as assistant commandant remained in actual charge of the school In 1924 Maj Oscar Westover became the first commandant to exercise control over school activities The assistant commandant then became responsible for academics assisted by the director of instruction directors of the individual academic departments and the school secretary formerly the school adjutant

Course instruction assumed a pattern combining both theory and practical instruction Subjects were generally scheduled in blocks particularly tactics beginning with those of other branches and services along with logistics and staff functions from the beginning of each class until December The courses in air tactics followed described by one student as coming with bewildering rapidity

Practical instruction came in the form of field problems initiated in the classroom then demonstrated and practiced in the practical flying course Annual inspection trips were also undertaken until 1930 to the Engineering Division at McCook and Wright Fields in Dayton Ohio when trips began to the Infantry School at Fort Benning Georgia Beginning in 1924 ACTS students also participated in the annual Army War College maneuvers at Ft DuPont Delaware However by 1931 doctrinal disagreements between the schools and the exclusion of ACTS staff from the planning process created a perceived misuse of airpower on the part of AWC planners that ACTS assistant commandant Maj John F Curry criticized as not being of value to students of either school Although Air Corps input resulted in some improvements a lack of funds eliminated ACTS participation after 1933

Difficulties with dilapidated facilities at Langley were not resolved and a proposed relocation to Staten Island was rejected by the staff for lack of yearround flying weather urban restrictions on flying and a lack of support facilities Locations at Bolling Field Washington DC Richmond Virginia San Antonio Texas Fort Riley Kansas and another area of Langley Field were studied before the choice was made of Maxwell Field a depot in Montgomery Alabama as the site for the school

Plans were developed for a campus to accommodate a tactical school of 75 students a squadron officers school of 50 junior officer students and a school demonstration flying group of four squadrons Congress appropriated almost 700000 by July 1929 for new buildings including Building 800Austin Hall to house the Tactical School and 200000 to purchase acreage on which to build new officer quarters Delays in construction caused two postponements of the relocation until June 1931 when Austin Hall was completed On 15 July 1931 the school completed its move although officer quarters were not begun until 1932 Architects commissioned by the Quartermaster Corps designed 99 residences for officers in an elegant style they deemed French Provencial and placed them in a neighborhood setting that became the showplace of the Air Corps The construction program at Maxwell continued until 1938 funded primarily by the WPA and PWA A bombing and gunnery range was also set up near Valparaiso Florida for Tactical School use

In 1934 Curry now ACTS Commandant reorganized the academic structure of the school along functional lines into three principal departments Air Tactics Ground Tactics and Basic and Special Instruction Flying was a fourth department The Air Force Attack Bombardment Pursuit and Observation sections were placed within the Department of Air Tactics The next year these departments became the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy Department of Ground Tactics and Department of Command Staff and Logistics

Four faculty committees were also established to administrate scheduling the school library and publication of doctrine The Air Corps Board which had been inactive since the move from Langley was permanently relocated to Maxwell in 1933 Restructured by the Tactical School faculty who doubled as its members the Board was directed by the War Department to formulate Air Corps doctrine The Board became indistinguishable from the Tactical School and undertook 77 projects between 1935 and 1942 a third of which dealt with tactical doctrine and the remainder with equipment armaments field manuals and training texts

After the move to Maxwell the practice of requiring students to fly actual missions as part of the instruction process was discontinued for safety reasons Plans for a composite school group were suspended by the Chief of the Air Corps because of a servicewide shortage of personnel and aircraft and attempts to have demonstrations by existing combat units were mostly unsatisfactory The demonstration group was not authorized until August 1939 and was utilized for less than a year before classes were suspended

In 1938 the Department of Flying Instruction was dissolved and its functions parceled out to the remaining departments The Department of Air Tactics and Strategy became the dominant division at the school and its Air Force Section the most important course in which airpower theories were presented and explored doctrine emerging as much from the students as from the faculty

Association with the Infantry School increased but inspection trips formerly used at Langley first became voluntary and then were discontinued Only a handful of graduates had gone on to attend the Command and General Staff School and as a result the Tactical School ended its role as a preparatory school Instead the ACTS became the equivalent for Air Corps officers of CGSS and increased the emphasis on air subjects to more than half of the total course hours by 19341935 with an accompanying decrease in hours for ground and administrative subjects Classroom studies were similarly altered Lectures occupied only half of a classroom hour with the remainder given over to discussion and debate of concepts presented and of alternative ideas

The limited class size at the Tactical School led the Air Corps in 1938 to study the feasibility of using a series of shorter courses to allow a greater number of officers to attend The study concluded that a significant number of potential staff and command officers had not attended the school and was growing annually It recommended that the ninemonth course be discontinued for a year and four 12week courses scheduled each having 100 students all drawn from the group of prospective senior staff

The plan had the drawbacks of limiting the amount of detail to which students could be exposed and would require a rebuilding of the staff and curriculum when the long course was reinstated Nevertheless the curriculum was changed from 712 academic hours to 298 The short courses began on 1 June 1939 and continued for the next year

In its first years the Tactical School taught that pursuit aviation was the most important of air operations epitomized by the 19251926 class text Employment of Combined Air Force that compared the importance of pursuit to the Air Service to that of infantry to the Army However in 1926 the Tactical School modified this principle by asserting for the first time that airpower could strike at vital points deep inside enemy territory rather than merely targeting an enemys military forces in a war of attrition By 1931 the Tactical School was teaching that a determined air attack once launched is most difficult if not impossible to stop This shift in emphasis from pursuit to bombardment was the result of two factors the air war theories of the time and the state of aviation technology

Devotees of Billy Mitchell many of whom had served with the 1st Provisional Air Brigade dominated the faculty of the Tactical School at Maxwell With their students they developed a theory of warfare that invoked the superiority of the longrange bomber over all other types of aircraft Going beyond Mitchells ideas they deemphasized balanced forces and support of ground troops in favor of a doctrine that heavily armed bombers could fight their way to industrial targets in daylight unescorted by fighters and with precision bombing made possible by the introduction of the Norden bombsight in 1931 defeat an enemy by destroying key war production targets rather than engaging in costly and prolonged ground campaigns aimed at destroying enemy armies While the theory was based on tenets of strategic airpower developed by Mitchell Hugh Trenchard and Giulio Douhet it rejected the concept of terrorbombing of civil populations as a means of destroying the morale and coercing the will of an enemy state

The formulators of this doctrine were relatively young junior officers nearly all of them former reservists commissioned during or immediately after World War I They viewed war in the abstract admitted and even apologized for being unable to offer conclusive proof of their theories but firmly believed that the dominance of airpower lay ahead in the future when existing limitations of technology had been overcome Nine key advocates all of whom instructed at the Tactical School became known as the Bomber Mafia The unofficial leader of the group was the bombardment section chief and later director of the Department of Air Tactics and Strategy Major Harold L George

The doctrine brought them in conflict with the Army General Staff which did not view airpower as a major striking arm but as an auxiliary to the ground forces Despite the poor performance of what few bombers the Air Corps possessed the air theorists persisted in their beliefs testifying in favor of a separate air force before commissions set up in the wake of the Air Mail scandal

Although flawed and tested only under optimal conditions the doctrine originally known as the industrial web theory became the primary airpower strategy of the United States in the planning for World War II Four former instructors of the school the core of the Bomber Mafia produced the two airpower war plans AWPD1 and AWPD42 that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the Army Air Forces

The doctrine was not universally held among air officers however Claire L Chennault chief of the pursuit section between 1931 and 1936 reasoned that the same technology that would increase the performance of the bomber would also eventually enable the singleengine fighter to challenge the bomber at high altitude which it could not do in the years when the daylight bombing doctrine was formulated Combined with a centralized early warning and control system which came with the development of radar defending interceptors would inflict serious losses on unescorted forces The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell who believed that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations

Chennault however also had a blind spot in his zealous advocacy of fighters as the offensive weapon of the Air Corps He consciously avoided acknowledging the role of accompanying escort fighters as part of an offensive air strike When his tour at ACTS ended the fighterversusbomber controversy became a moot point among the staff to the detriment of developing a role for escort fighters

Although the proponents of daylight precision bombing at the Tactical School had a failure of imagination in not expanding the doctrine to include establishing air superiority as a prerequisite for success and thus contributed to the delay in the development of a longrange escort fighter until two years into the war the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the Air Force from the Army and the basis for modern airpower theory ACTS graduate instructor and Bomber Mafia member Haywood S Hansell concurred that both the theorists and the authors of the AWPD1 war plan he was both made a serious mistake in neglecting longrange fighter escort in their ideas Hansell wrote

It was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable but no one could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical Schools major shortcomings

However he also stated that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run He surmised that had radar been a factor in doctrine many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential to the creation of the United States Air Force Development of fighters was not ignored by October 1940 over a year before Pearl Harbor every type of pistondriven singleengine fighter used by the United States Army Air Forces USAAF in World War II had made its first flight except the P47 Thunderbolt However the press of the enormous tasks confronting the Air Corps and the primacy of strategic bombing doctrine meant that development of a longrange capability for these new fighters was not undertaken until combat losses to bombers forced the issue

Before the short courses began President Franklin D Roosevelt called for an expansion of the Air Corps in January 1939 The need for experienced officers to supervise the expansion led to plans to reduce the size of the faculty and long course classes as a compromise to keep the school functioning Six of the 24 Air Corps instructors would be returned to regular duty and class sizes would be reduced from 60 to 20 students However World War II in Europe began on 1 September 1939 before the staff and class reductions could be implemented The Air Corps permitted the short courses to be finished but suspended all instruction on 30 June 1940 The Tactical School was reduced to a caretaker staff of seven officers including two librarians

One year later the Tactical School came under the control of the Southeast Air Corps Training Center headquartered at Maxwell with the objective of reopening the school immediately After completion of a study the center recommended in July 1941 that the Tactical School curriculum be modified into a tenweek basic course in tactics for squadron and group level junior grade officers to instruct 2000 officers its first year and 5000 officers thereafter ending its twin missions of senior officer service school and doctrine development center Instead the Air Corps Board was moved to Eglin Field Florida and absorbed by the Air Corps Proving Ground while all remaining staff of the Tactical School were transferred to Washington DC where they continued work mainly the production of training literature until 30 June 1942 after which the school went unstaffed until its formal dissolution in 1946

The ACTS at Maxwell graduated 870 officers 400 of them in the short courses During its entire history the Tactical School trained 1091 officers 916 of them in the Air Service or Air Corps 158 graduates from other arms included 118 Army officers 35 Marines and five Naval officers The Tactical School also trained 17 officers from foreign countries Of the 320 general officers in the Army Air Forces at the end of World War II 261 were Tactical School graduates including 14 of the 18 highestranking AAF generals 134 officers including 21 from the Army and Navy served on the faculty of the Tactical School during its 20 years of existence 58 of whom became general officers

The senior service school function was abandoned for the duration of World War II in favor of development of an actual tactical center responsible for the mass teaching of all aspects of air warfare to inexperienced officers who would become commanders of newly created units Although commandants at ACTS had lobbied throughout its existence for the Tactical School to serve as the nucleus of such a center it instead became the function of a new school the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics activated 27 October 1942 in Orlando Florida both for the training of unit cadres and the continuing development of tactical doctrine

The experiences of World War II created a new impetus for professional education of air commanders as it had after World War I but on a much vaster scale The expectation of becoming a separate service from the Army resulted in planning for a servicewide educational system the nucleus of which would be the Air University Established in 1946 AU coordinated all professional education for Air Force officers and fell heir to the purpose and tradition of the old Tactical School

Lewis Waterman
Lewis Edson Waterman November 18 1837  May 1 1901 born in Decatur New York held multiple fountain pen patents and was the founder of the Waterman pen company

Lewis Edson Watermans entry into fountain pen manufacturing has only recently been properly researched Waterman was working as a pen salesman in New York for a new company founded in the spring of 1883 by a volatile inventor named Frank Holland Holland abandoned his company after only six weeks Waterman stepped in and took over fitting the pens with a simplified feed of his own design It was for this three fissure feed which his first penrelated patent was granted in 1884

Following his death in Brooklyn in 1901 his nephew Frank D Waterman took the business overseas and increased sales to 350000 pens per year

Waterman was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006
There has been a great deal of mythologizing of Watermans life and career The tale that he was prompted to invent a better fountain pen upon losing an insurance sale after the contract was spoiled by an ink blot left by a balky fountain pen has been widely repeated but is completely unfounded

Waterman was born in Decatur New York His father was a wagon maker who died when Lewis was three The boy grew up on his stepfathers farm attending the district school until he was fifteen then attending the seminary at Charlottesville New York for some three months Still fifteen he began teaching supplementing his income by carpentry work Waterman chiefly taught Pitman shorthand stenography which took him to Illinois and Virginia

Waterman began selling insurance in 1862 starting in Michigan but relocating to Boston in 1864 In the late 1860s Waterman and his wife Sara Ann Roberts were converted to Spiritualism his wife gained some fame and income as a medium only to be unmasked and publicly pilloried as a charlatan In the wake of this and the death of an infant daughter in the summer of 1870 Waterman left his wife and remaining children and moved to New York In New York Waterman attended lectures at the American Institute of Phrenology from which he graduated that same year Waterman remained keen on phrenology until the end of his life By 1871 he was promoting the Reactionary Lifter a form of weight training machine Waterman remarried in 1872 and was back in the insurance business in Boston from 1875 to 1877 A few years later he was on the move again working as editor for railroad journals The Railroad Gazette and National Car Builder It appears that it was during this period that Waterman began to sell fountain pens not of his manufacture Near the end of his life Waterman started the Waterman Condensing Company to make fruit extracts but this venture lasted only a few years

Kite running
Kite running is the practice of running after drifting kites in the sky that have been cut loose in kite fighting Typically the custom is that the person who captures a cut kite can keep it so the bigger and more expensive looking the kite the more people can usually be seen running after it to try to capture it

Kite fighting is a popular pastime in the Indian subcontinent throughout the year and during kite flying festivals and also in Afghanistan Iran in Chile and Brazil and many other places throughout the world In most cases the fine string that is used to fly these kites is coated with powdered glass and flyers try to cut the string of the other kites

When the losers kite string is cut the kite drifts free with the wind until it falls to the ground Kite running is the practice of running after these cut kites to try to capture them when they come down Typically the custom is that the person who captures a cut kite can keep it In cities and towns the bigger and more expensive looking the kite the more people can usually be seen running after it to try to capture it as their free prize

Droves of people of all ages may run after a kite and try to capture it with the help of poles or broken off tree branches with which they try to entangle the loose string trailing with the kite Running after and capturing these kites is often made more difficult when these drifting kites are taken long distances with the wind or fall atop trees electric poles and houses over compound walls and fences or in the middle of or across busy roads and railway lines

Kite runners endanger their lives by running into the path of oncoming traffic and trains without looking down or fall from trees and buildings which they were trying to scale to get at kites that landed on top while gazing up and running after kites They may walk around in the middle of congested towns and cities and while gazing up may be dangerously unaware of what is happening on the ground in their immediate surroundings causing injuries and collisions with traffic

There have also been incidents with glasscoated kite strings causing injuries or damage where other people birds or electricity cables get entangled with the string In particular it is liable to slitting the throats of children participating in the Market Sankranti festival where a popular challenge is to cut other kite strings with your own This has led to a blanket ban on glasscoated strings in Mumbai issued on December 14 2016

Kite running has featured in a few books including The Kite Runner written by Khaled Hosseini

Paul Mascarene
JeanPaul Mascarene c 1684  22 January 1760 was a LieutenantGovernor of Nova Scotia and commander of the 40th Regiment of Foot from 1740 to 1749 During this time he led the colony through King Georges War He had an extensive military career throughout his life during the events of British and French conflict that led to the Seven Years War the North American theater is known as the French and Indian War

Mascarene was of French birth of a Huguenot family driven from France at the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685 Subsequently Mascarene was cared for by relatives in Geneva where he was raised and received his education

About 1706 he moved to England where he received an ensigncya badge in the Regiment of French Foot He was stationed at Portsmouth in 1708 where he was commissioned a lieutenant By having the advantage of the French language the Governor of Nova Scotia Samuel Vetch took an interest in Mascarene to use him in relations with French speaking inhabitants of his territory In 1711 Mascarene was posted at Boston Massachusetts where he met and married Elizabeth Perry by whom he would have four children In August 1714 Vetch sent Mascarene and Captain Joseph Bennett with a detachment of troops to Minas located in the GrandPr region of Nova Scotia Canada Mascarenes orders were to be courteous but to collect a tribute worth 6000 livres from the Acadian inhabitants Vetch appointed him with a committee to hear and settle disputes between the Acadians During the next five years Mascarene divided his time between Boston and Placentia Newfoundland where he was in charge of an infantry company

By August 1717 he was commissioned a captain in the newly formed 40th Regiment of Foot and put in charge of a grenadier company When Port Royal Nova Scotia was surrendered in October he had the honour to take possession of it in mounting the first guard Whether by formal education or breadth of interests he was considered an engineer as well as a regular officer and artilleryman and a visit to England during this period resulted in his appointment as engineer to the Board of Ordnance By 1719 he was back in Boston preparing to embark for Annapolis with orders to report on the state of the fortifications there 

He was commissioned LieutenantGovernor of Nova Scotia in 1740 until he was replaced by Edward Cornwallis in 1749 
In 1751 the new governor Cornwallis sent Mascarene to New England to renew the 1726 treaty with the eastern Indians Norridgewocks Penobscots Malecites and although he corresponded with his Annapolis friends for several years he did not return to Nova Scotia

In the course of service he rose to the rank of MajorGeneral 
He died poor having only half the pay of his lieutenantcolonelcy to sustain his remaining days in Boston
Nonetheless he was content with his family of whom he expressed thanks to Almighty God to be in my own house amongst my Children and    grandchildren Two of his grandchildren Hon Foster Hutchinson and William Handfield Snelling both buried in the Old Burying Ground

David Twohill
David Twohill is a musician formerly with Australian band Mental As Anything who is also known by the pseudonym Wayne DeLisle or as Bird

Twohill was born in Cooma New South Wales Australia on 21 April 1954 as Wayne Delisle He moved to Sydney in the early 1970s and attended the East Sydney Technical College at Darlinghurst Here he met and later auditioned on drums with fellow students Chris ODoherty Martin Murphy and Steve Coburn who were putting a band together The band would soon be called Mental As Anything and would become well known around Australia and the world He later changed his name to David Twohill

Twohill is not a recognised artist however he has had works exhibited at various group art exhibitions He has tended to concentrate on curatorial responsibilities with exhibitions at Tamworth Manly and Liverpool under his control

In the early days of the Mentals the band would often invent pseudonyms for each other that combined an exotic last name with a common Australian first name The nickname of Bird or CByrd as it was often written was bestowed by Reg Mombassa who thought the scavenging seagulls at Bondi Beach reminded him of Twohill The nickname was immortalised in the Mentals song Looking For Bird from the Cats  Dogs album

Twohill with his wife Sue was in the national news on Christmas Day 2001 when their house was lost in bushfiresa benefit gig Birds Big Burnout occurred at Revesby in early 2002 and a fourpiece Midnight Oil minus Peter Garrett performed

Sudbury Spartans
The Sudbury Spartans are an amateur gridiron football team based in the city of Greater Sudbury Ontario Established in 1952 it is the longest continuously operating sports organization in Sudbury The Spartans have won more Northern Football Conference Championships 18 than any other team in the league

The team plays in the Northern Football Conference which also includes current teams from Hamilton Montreal Oakville Tri City North Bay Sault Ste Marie Ottawa Sarnia and 2 from Toronto

The Spartans began play in 1954 as Charter Members of the Northern Ontario RugbyFootball Union predecessor to the NFC Originally named Hardrocks to reflect the Sudburys predominant mining industry the moniker was changed to Spartans in 1967 by then rookie head coach Sid Forster Forster a member of the 1953 team who was inducted in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2001 felt the old name sounded more like a street gang than a football team

Following the death of Forster in 1994 the team struggled to remain competitive It faced several winless seasons in which it could not finish above 500 During this period it fielded teams as small as 20 men On May 14 2007 the Spartans suspended operations due to an insufficient number of players to safely field a team The team entered into a twoyear leave of absence from the NFC and were hoping to return to NFC action by 2010 however there is no indication of a leader ready to take ownership of the organization

In the Fall of 2010 football had become a major sport in City of Greater Sudbury It had become the most popular participation sport in local high schools The Joe Macdonald Youth Football league was flourishing the high school league bursting at the seams and the Sudbury Gladiators of the Ontario Football Conference had enjoyed a few seasons of success on the gridiron This resulted in a number of graduated Gladiator players looking to continue playing summer football

The Sudbury Spartan executive were approached by this group and after challenging the football players in Sudbury to commit to playing summer ball by preregistering for the 2011 NFC season an abundance of players answered the call and signed up and paid their team fees to play for the Spartans during the upcoming 2011 NFC season Having answered the call to commit Spartan President and former head coach Gord Goddard brought together a new Spartan Team Executive and began the process of reentry into the NFC as a member club

The Sudbury Spartans have been welcomed back into the Northern Football Conference On Saturday November 20 2010 the member clubs of the NFC gave the Spartans conditional acceptance back into the league Official approval will come January 22 2011 at the NFC Annual General Meeting in Ottawa

On January 22 2011 the Sudbury Spartans were granted official and full membership back into the Northern Football Conference

After a 4year leave of absence  the Spartans return to the gridiron for the first time since 2006 The 2011 team will feature a number of Spartan legends returning to the gridiron

The offence will be led by NFC Hall of Famer Dave St Amour joining St Amour on offence will be returning veterans Brandon Dougan Al Kawa Steve Gravel Walter Wilson Jordan Cecchetto and Phil Gleason

The defense will be led by NFC Hall of Famer Junior Labrosse alongside veterans Christian Lorenz Bruno Rocca Kyle Henri Yves Filliatrault and Tommy Dube

Some exciting new faces to the mix include former North Bay Bulldog Dustin Crowder Paul Javor Brett McKnight Matt Beaulieu Alex Balloway and Eric Breau

The team has signed 42 players for the 2011 Season already and still looking for more

The 2011 season started with a bang Sudbury visited its long time southern rivals the Oakville Longhorns and won

When the Spartans returned to their real home Queens Field they took another victory against the Toronto Raiders

Helen Blanchard
Helen Augusta Blanchard 25 October 1840  January 12 1922 was an American inventor who received 28 patents between 1873 and 1915 She was known for her numerous inventions dealing with sewing machines and sewing technology

Blanchard was born in Portland Maine on October 25 1840 to a wealthy family Her father was Nathaniel Blanchard a shipowner and businessman her mother was Phoebe Buxton Blanchard Helen was one of six children two other daughters Louise Phobe and Persis E and three sons David H Augustus and Albus Helen demonstrated an inventive turn of mind at an early age but did not receive her first patent until she was over thirty after the fall of her fathers business There is no indication that she received any mechanical or technical education despite her patents being involved mostly in these subjects

Her father suffered financial losses as a result of the business panic of 1866 resulting in the loss of the family homestead Nathaniel died leaving his family with financial troubles Helen Blanchard moved to Boston Massachusetts and patented several inventions relating to sewing machines in 1873 and 1875 This included the Blanchard overseamingmachine which could simultaneously sew and trim knitted fabrics

After developing techniques for zigzag stitching and overseaming Blanchard moved to Philadelphia where she established the Blanchard Overseaming Company of Philadelphia to market her inventions in the late 1870s or early 1880s She also founded the Blanchard Hosiery Machine Company in 1882 She moved to New York in the early 1890s and continued to patent a variety of inventions including a pencil sharpener and a hat sewing machine

Having profited from her commercial ventures Blanchard was able to buy back the family homestead in Portland and moved back there in 1901 She continued to patent inventions until suffering a stroke in 1916 She died in Providence RI in 1922 and is buried in the family plot in Portlands Evergreen Cemetery  It is unclear what became of her property and wealth after her death However she was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006

Helen Blanchard received 28 patents over about 45 years 22 of which involved sewing and sewing machines Many of these inventions have been referenced by other inventors in their own designs

Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays
Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays is a 1974 book by economist Murray Rothbard The book represents the authors theorizing on topics impacting human liberty Rothbard looks beyond conventional leftright thinking and hence contributes to the groundwork for the current intellectual challenge against centralized social and economic management

The books title comes from the lead essay which argues that egalitarian theory always results in a politics of statist control because it is founded on revolt against the ontological structure of reality itself According to Rothbard in this lead essay statist intellectuals attempt to replace what exists with a Romantic image of an idealized primitive state of nature an ideal which cannot and should not be achieved according to Rothbard The implications of this point are worked out on topics such as market economics child rights environmentalism feminism foreign policy redistribution and others

Roy Childs writes in the Foreword
For until Rothbards work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty the value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully appreciated and moreover the unity and true historical context of libertarianism will not even be fully grasped

Intel MCS96
The Intel MCS96 is a family of microcontrollers MCU commonly used in embedded systems The family is often referred to as the 8xC196 family or 80196 the most popular MCU in the family These MCUs are commonly used in hard disk drives modems printers pattern recognition and motor control In 2007 Intel announced the discontinuance of the entire MCS96 family of microcontrollers Intel noted that There are no direct replacements for these components and a redesign will most likely be necessary

The MCS96 family originated as a commercial derivative of the Intel 8061 the first processor in the Ford EECIV engine controller family Differences between the 8061 and the 8096 include the memory interface bus the 8061s MBus being a burstmode bus requiring a tracking program counter in the memory devices There were also considerable differences in the IO peripherals of the two parts  the 8061 had 8 HSI pulsemeasurement inputs 10 HSO pulsegeneration outputs entirely separated from the HSI pins and a nonsampling 10bit ADC with more channels than the 8096 had Many differences between the EECIV and the 8096 resulted from an effort to share pins to reduce IO pin count in favor of using the pins for a more conventional memory interface bus The 8096 also had onchip program memory lacking in the 8061

Ford created the Ford Microelectronics facility in Colorado Springs in 1982 to propagate the EECIV family develop other custom circuits for use in automobiles and to explore the gallium arsenide integrated circuit market Parts in that family included the 8065 which incorporated a memory controller allowing it to address a megabyte of memory

The family of microcontrollers are 16bit however they do have some 32bit operations The processors operate at 16 20 25 and 50 MHz and is separated into 3 smaller families The HSI high speed input  HSO high speed output family operates at 16 and 20MHz and the EPA event processor array family operates at all of the frequencies

The main features of the MCS96 family include a large onchip memory Registertoregister architecture three operand instructions bus controller to allow 8 or 16 bit bus widths and direct flat addressability of large blocks 256 or more of registers

The 809x839x879x ICs are members of the MCS96 family Although MCS96 is thought of as the 8x196 family the 8095 was the first member of the family Later the 8096 8097 8395 8396 and 8397 were added to the family

The Intel 809x839x879x ICs are 12 MHz 16 bit microcontrollers The microchip is based on a 5 V 3 micrometre HMOS process The microcontroller has an onchip ALU 4 channel 10 bit analogtodigital converter ADC 8 bit pulse width modulator PWM watchdog timer 4 16bit software timers hardware multiply and divide and 8 KB of onchip ROM The 8095 is ROMless and has five 8bit high speed IO full duplex serial port as well as an ADC input and PWM output

The 8095 comes in a 48pin Ceramic DIP package and the following part number variants C809590 

The MCS96 family is generally thought of as the 80C196 IC even though the family includes the 809x839x879x microcontrollers which came first Members of this subfamily are 80C196 83C196 87C196 and 88C196

As of 2017 microcontrollers using the MCS96 architecture are still being manufactured by NIIET in Voronesh Russia as the 1874 series of integrated circuits This includes a radiationhardened device with a Spacewire interface under the designation 1874VE7T  Cobham formerly Aeroflex manufactures another radiationhardened MCS96 microcontroller

Huanghetitan
Huanghetitan meaning Yellow River titan is a genus of sauropod dinosaur from the early Cretaceous Period It was a basal titanosauriform which lived in what is now Gansu China

The type species Huanghetitan liujiaxiaensis was described by You et al in 2006 It is known from fragmentary materials including two caudal vertebrae an almost complete sacrum rib fragments and the left shoulder girdle and was discovered in the eastern part of the Lanzhou Basin Hekou group in the Gansu Province in 2004

A second species H ruyangensis was described in 2007 from the AptianAlbian Haoling Formation of Ruyang County China Henan Province A recent cladistic analysis has found that this species is or more likely not related to H liujiaxiaensis and even requires a new genus name It is known from a partial vertebral column and several ribs the size of which the largest approaches 3m 10ft indicate it had among the deepest body cavities of any known dinosaur This second species along with its local relatives Daxiatitan and Ruyangosaurus is one of the biggest dinosaurs ever found in Asia and possibly one of the largest in the world

In 2007 L Junchang et al created a new family for Huanghetitan the Huangetitanidae but this family found to be polyphyletic by Mannion et al

Passing racial identity
Racial passing occurs when a person classified as a member of one racial group is accepted as a member of a racial group other than their own Historically the term has been used primarily in the United States to describe a person of color or multiracial ancestry who has assimilated into the white majority during times when legal and social conventions of hypodescent classified the person as a minority subject to racial segregation and discrimination regardless of their actual ancestry 

To fully understand how some AfricanAmerican people pass as white one must acknowledge the rape of slave women at the hands of white plantation owners Although antimiscegenation laws outlawing racial intermarriage existed in America as early as 1664 there were no laws preventing the rape of enslaved women For generations enslaved black mothers bore mixedrace children who were deemed mulattos quadroons octoroons or even hexadecaroons based on their percentage of white blood 

Although the aforementioned mixedrace people were often half white or more institutions of hypodescent and the 20thcentury one drop rule classified them as black and therefore inferior particularly after slavery became a racial caste But there were other mixedrace people who were born to unions or marriages in colonial Virginia between free white women and African or AfricanAmerican men free indentured or slave and became ancestors to many free families of color in the early decades of the US as documented by Paul Heinegg in his Free African Americans of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Maryland and Delaware

Mixedrace African Americans sometimes used their racially ambiguous appearance and often majority European ancestry in order to pass as white and evade the restrictions against them to seek better lives For some people passing as white and using their whiteness to uplift other black people was the best way to undermine the system that relegated black people to a lower position in society Although reasons behind passing are deeply individual the history of African Americans passing as white can be categorized by the following time periods the antebellum era postemancipation Reconstruction through Jim Crow and present day

During the antebellum period passing as white was a means of escaping slavery Once they left the plantation escaped slaves who could pass as white found safety in their perceived whiteness To pass as white was to pass as free However once they gained their freedom most escaped slaves intended to return to blackness  passing as white was a temporary disguise used to gain freedom Once they had escaped their racial ambiguity could be a safeguard to their freedom If an escaped slave was able to pass as white they were less likely to be caught and returned to their plantation If they were caught whitepassing slaves such as Jane Morrison could sue for their freedom using their white appearance as justification for emancipation

Postemancipation passing as white was no longer a means to obtain freedom As passing shifted from a necessity to an option it fell out of favor in the black community Author Charles W Chestnutt who was born free in Ohio as a mixedrace African American explored circumstances for persons of color in the South after emancipation for instance for a formerly enslaved woman who marries a whitepassing man shortly after the conclusion of Civil War Some fictional exploration coalesced around the figure of the tragic mulatta a woman whose future is compromised by her being mixed race and able to pass for white
During the Reconstruction era black people slowly gained the constitutional rights of which they were deprived during slavery Although they would not secure full constitutional equality for another century until after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 reconstruction promised African Americans legal equality for the first time Abolishing slavery did not abolish racism During Reconstruction whites tried to enforce white supremacy in part through the rise of Ku Klux Klan chapters rifle clubs and later paramilitary insurgent groups such as the Red Shirts 

Passing was used by some African Americans to evade segregation Those who were able to pass as white often engaged in tactical passing or passing as white in order to get a job go to school or to travel Outside of these situations tactical passers still lived as black people and for this reason tactical passing is also referred to as 9 to 5 passing The writer and literary critic Anatole Broyard saw his father pass in order to get work after his Louisiana Creole family moved north to Brooklyn before World War II 

This idea of crossing the color line at different points in ones life is explored in James Weldon Johnsons Autobiography of an ExColored Man But the narrator closes the novel by saying I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage meaning that he regrets trading in his blackness for whiteness The idea that passing as white was a rejection of blackness was common at the time and remains so to the present time

People also chose to pass for good during Jim Crow and beyond The US civil rights leader Walter Francis White who was blondhaired blueeyed and very fair was of mixedrace mostly European ancestry 27 of his 32 greatgreatgreatgrandparents were white the other five were classified as black and had been slaves He grew up with his parents and family in Atlanta in the black community and identified with it He served as the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP from 1929 until his death in 1955 In the earlier stages of his career he conducted investigations in the South during which he sometimes passed as white in order to gather information more freely on lynchings and hate crimes and to protect himself in socially hostile environments

In the 20th century Krazy Kat comics creator George Herriman was a Louisiana Creole cartoonist born to mulatto parents who claimed Greek heritage throughout his adult life 

The 20thcentury writer and critic Anatole Broyard was a Louisiana Creole who chose to pass for white in his adult life in New York City and Connecticut He wanted to create an independent writing life and rejected being classified as a black writer In addition he did not identify with northern urban black people whose experiences had been much different from his as a child in New Orleans Creole community He married an American woman of European descent His wife and many of his friends knew he was partly black in ancestry His daughter Bliss Broyard did not find out until after her fathers death In 2007 she published a memoir that traced her exploration of her fathers life and family mysteries entitled One Drop My Fathers Hidden Life A Story of Race and Family Secrets

The rise of the civil rights movement and the enforcement of voting rights for African Americans particularly in the South meant that political leaders called on all African Americans to unify in order to maximize their power

Passing as white in the 21stcentury is more controversial it is often seen as a rejection of blackness family and culture

A paradoxical example of racial passing in the modern day is Rachel Dolezal see below a white woman who worked for AfricanAmerican rights and tried to pass as African American She worked as a civil rights activist Her attempt at passing was in order to gain the support of the black community She became president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP before her parents identified her as white

In 21stcentury intersectional discourse the term whitepassing refers to someone who identifies as a person of color but benefits from white privilege due to their appearance

Other persons have passed as Native American or First Nations people 

In the New Age and Hippie movements nonNative people sometimes have attempted to pass as Native American or other Indigenous medicine people The pejorative term for such people is plastic shaman

The author and environmentalist Grey Owl was born in United Kingdom as a white man named Archibald Belaney he made a life in Canada and claimed to be a First Nations person When asked to explain his European appearance he lied and claimed he was half Scottish and half Apache There are numerous Native Americanidentified persons of multiracial ancestry Belaney performed what he said were Ojibwe cultural practices and wilderness skills and adopted an anachronistic and stereotypical lifestyle as part of a persona which he was successful in marketing to nonNative audiences

The United States actor Iron Eyes Cody who was of Sicilian descent developed a niche in Hollywood by playing roles of Native Americans Initially playing Indians only in movies and television eventually he wore his film costumes fulltime and insisted he was of Cherokee and Cree descent 

In the visual arts and literature other EuropeanAmericans have also attempted to pass as being indigenous Ku Klux Klan leader and segregationist speech writer Asa Earl Carter attempted to reinvent himself as Cherokee author Forrest Carter author of the novel The Education of Little Tree

Jay Marks a man of EasternEuropean Jewish ancestry adopted the pen name of Jamake Highwater about 1969 claiming to be CherokeeBlackfeet and published numerous books under that name He won awards and NEA grants 

Americanborn sculptor Jimmie Durham was exposed as a man posing as a Cherokee Artist Yeffe Kimball claimed to be Osage

To try to protect Native American artists from the claims of nonNative impersonators the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 was passed in the United States It requires any visual artist claiming to be a Native American artist to be either an enrolled member of a state or federally recognized tribe or for a recognized tribe to designate the artist as a tribal artisan

In academia due to nontribal colleges and universities reliance on selfidentification of tribal identity nonNative people have sometimes passed as Native Americans

Professor and activist Ward Churchill who advocated for American Indian rights claimed to be alternately Cherokee Muscogee Creek and Mtis His claims were eventually rejected by the tribes he claimed specifically the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians Churchill was fired in 2007 from the University of Colorado for academic misconduct over his research and writings

The Wall Street Journal reported on October 5 2015 that Dartmouth College fired the Director of its Native American Program Susan Taffe Reed after tribal officials and alumni accused her of misrepresenting herself as an American Indian She previously taught at Dartmouth Bowdoin College and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

Terry Tafoya now going by the name Ty Nolan a former psychology professor at Evergreen State College passed as being Warm Springs and Taos Pueblo The Seattle Post Intelligencer discovered that he was neither and reported his deception

The Native American and Indigenous Studies Associations Statement on Indigenous Identity Fraud says
If we believe in Indigenous selfdetermination as a value and goal then questions of identity and integrity in its expression cannot be treated as merely a distraction from supposedly more important issues Falsifying ones identity or relationship to particular Indigenous peoples is an act of appropriation continuous with other forms of colonial violence

Civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal then president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP claimed in a February 2015 profile to have been born in a Montana tepee and have hunted for food with her family as a child with bows and arrows She primarily identified as African American and had established herself as an activist in Spokane 

In 2015 Dolezals mother disputed her daughters accounts saying that the familys ancestry was Czech Swedish and German with faint traces of Native American heritage She also denied various claims made by her daughter about her life including having lived in Africa when young although the parents did live there for a time after Dolezal had left home Dolezal ultimately resigned from her position at the Spokane NAACP chapter

In 2015 Vijay Chokalingam the brother of IndianAmerican entertainer Mindy Kaling told CNN that he had pretended to be black years before in order to take advantage of affirmative action to be admitted into medical school The medical school issued a statement that Chokalingams grades and scores met the criteria for acceptance at the time and race had played no factor in his admission

John Roland Redd was an AfricanAmerican musician born and raised in Missouri In the 1950s he assumed a new identity claiming to be an Indian named Korla Pandit and fabricating a history of birth in New Delhi India to a Brahmin priest and a French opera singer He established a career in this exotic persona described as an Indian Liberace Two years after his death in 1999 his true ethnic identity was revealed in an article by Los Angeles magazine editor R J Smith

For Jews in Nazi Germany passing as Aryan or white and nonJewish was a means of escaping persecution There were three ways to avoid being shipped off to the death camps run hide or pass No option was perfect and all carried the risk of getting caught People who could not run away but wanted to maintain a life without hiding attempted to pass as aryan People who were visibly Jewish could try to alter their appearance to become aryan while other Jewish people with more ambiguous features could pass into the aryan ideal more easily In these attempts to pass as aryan Jewish people altered their appearance by dying their hair blonde and even attempting to reverse circumcisions Edith Hahn Beer was Jewish and passed as Aryan she survived the Holocaust by living with and marrying a Nazi officer HahnBeer wrote a memoir called The Nazi Officers Wife How One Jewish Woman Survived the Holocaust Another such example is Stella Kbler a Jewish collaborator who initially attempted to hide her Jewish background

Examples of racial passing have been used by people to assimilate into groups other than European Marie Lee Bandura who grew up as part of the Qayqayt First Nation in New Westminster British Columbia was orphaned and believed she was the last of her people She moved to Vancouvers Chinatown married a Chinese man and raised her four children as Chinese One day she told her daughter Rhonda Larrabee about her heritage I will tell you once but you must never ask me again

In Latin America generational acculturation and assimilation took place via intermarriage Mediumbrown offspring of even dark parents were no longer black but were labeled with any of a halfdozen terms denoting class as much as skin tone Descendants who were Europeanlooking were accepted as white

Patrick OBrian 1914  2000 born Richard Patrick Russ an English novelist and translator best known for his AubreyMaturin series of sea novels set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was for many years presumed by reviewers and journalists to be Irish and he took no steps to correct the impression until a 1999 expos in The Daily Telegraph made public the facts of his ancestry original name and first marriage provoking considerable critical media comment

History of Indigenous Australians
The History of Indigenous Australians began at least 65000 years ago when humans first populated Australia

The origin of first humans to populate the southern continent remains a matter of conjecture and debate Some anthropologists believe they could have arrived as a result of the earliest human migrations out of Africa Although they likely migrated to the territory later named Australia through Southeast Asia they are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or Polynesian population There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modernday New Guinea and the islands but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage

At the time of first European contact it is generally estimated that between 315000 to 750000 people lived in Australia in diverse groups but upper estimates place the total population as high as 125 million A cumulative population of 16 billion people has been estimated to have lived in Australia over 65000 years prior to British colonisation The regions of heaviest Indigenous population were the same temperate coastal regions that are currently the most heavily populated In the early 1900s it was commonly believed that the Aboriginal population of Australia was leading toward extinction The population shrank from those present when colonisation occurred in 1788 to 50000 in 1930 this was primarily due to an outbreak of smallpox and to a lesser extent from other diseases

Postcolonisation the coastal Indigenous populations were soon absorbed depleted or forced from their lands the traditional aspects of Aboriginal life which remained persisted most strongly in areas such as the Great Sandy Desert where European settlement has been sparse The greatest population density was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent the Murray River valley in particular Although the Indigenous Tasmanians were driven to extinction other Aboriginal Australians maintained successful communities throughout Australia Technologies diets and hunting practices varied according to the local environment

It is believed that the first early human migration to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the Sahul continent connected to the island of New Guinea via a land bridge It is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between Sulawesi and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via Timor The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians has been a matter of dispute among archaeologists The most generally accepted date for first arrival is between 4000080000 years BP Near Penrith in New South Wales since 1971 numerous Aboriginal stone tools have been found in Cranebrook Terraces gravel sediments having dates of 45000 to 50000 years BP When these results were new they were controversial but more recent dating of the same strata in 1987 and 2003 has corroborated these dates A 48000 BCE date is based on a few sites in northern Australia dated using thermoluminescence

A large number of sites have been radiocarbon dated to around 38000 BCE leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the thermoluminescence technique Radiocarbon dating is limited to a maximum age of around 40000 years Some estimates have been given as widely as from 30000 to 68000 BCE Earlier dates are requiring new techniques such as optically stimulated luminescence OSL and accelerator mass spectrometry AMS and the evidence for an earlier date of arrival is growing Charles Dortch has dated recent finds on Rottnest Island Western Australia at 70000 years BP The rock shelters at Malakunanja II a shallow rockshelter about 50 kilometres inland from the present coast and of Nauwalabila I 70 kilometres further south show evidence of used pieces of ochre  evidence for paint used by artists 60000 years ago Using OSL Rhys Jones has obtained a date for stone tools in these horizons dating from 5300060000 years ago

Thermoluminescence dating of the Jinmium site in the Northern Territory suggested a date of 116000 plus or minus 12000 BCE Although this result received wide press coverage it is not accepted by most archaeologists Only Africa has older physical evidence of habitation by modern humans There is also evidence of a change in fire regimes in Australia drawn from reef deposits in Queensland between 70 and 100000 years ago and the integration of human genomic evidence from various parts of the world also supports a date of before 60000 years for the arrival of Australian Aboriginal people in the continent

Humans reached Tasmania approximately 40000 years ago by migrating across a land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last glacial maximum After the seas rose about 12000 years ago and covered the land bridge the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of European settlers

Short statured aboriginal tribes inhabited the rainforests of North Queensland of which the best known group is probably the Tjapukai of the Cairns area These rainforest people collectively referred to as Barrineans were once considered to be a relic of an earlier wave of Negrito migration to the Australian continent but this theory no longer finds much favour

Mungo Man whose remains were discovered in 1974 near Lake Mungo in New South Wales is the oldest human yet found in Australia Although the exact age of Mungo Man is in dispute the best consensus is that he is at least 40000 years old Stone tools also found at Lake Mungo have been estimated based on stratigraphic association to be about 50000 years old Since Lake Mungo is in southeastern Australia many archaeologists have concluded that humans must have arrived in northwest Australia at least several thousand years earlier

In 2012 the results of largescale genotyping has indicated that Aboriginal Australians the indigenous peoples of New Guinea and the Mamanwa an indigenous people of the southern Philippines are closely related having diverged from a common origin approximately 36000 years ago The same studies show that Aboriginal genomes consist of up to 11 Indian DNA which is uniformly spread through Northern Australia indicating a substantial gene flow between Indian populations and Northern Australia occurred around 4230 years ago Changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time suggesting there may have been migration from India

When the northwest of Australia which is closest to Asia was first occupied the region consisted of open tropical forests and woodlands After around 10000 years of stable climatic conditions by which time the Aboriginal people had settled the entire continent temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger leading to the beginning of an ice age By the glacial maximum 25000 to 15000 years ago the sea level had dropped to around 140 metres below its present level Australia was connected to New Guinea and the Kimberley region of Western Australia was separated from Southeast Asia Wallacea by a strait only approximately 90km wide Rainfall was 40 to 50 lower than modern levels depending on region while the lower CO levels half preindustrial levels meant that vegetation required twice as much water for photosynthesis

The Kimberley including the adjacent exposed continental Sahul Shelf was covered by vast grasslands dominated by flowering plants of the family Poaceae with woodlands and semiarid scrub covering the shelf joining New Guinea to Australia Southeast of the Kimberley from the Gulf of Carpentaria to northern Tasmania the land including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves was covered largely by extreme deserts and sand dunes It is believed that during this period no more than 15 of Australia supported trees of any kind While some tree cover remained in the southeast of Australia the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semiarid savannah while some tropical rainforests survived in isolated coastal areas of Queensland

Tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands with snow pines at lower altitudes There is evidence that there may have been a significant reduction in Australian Aboriginal populations during this time and there would seem to have been scattered refugia in which the modern vegetation types and Aboriginal populations were able to survive Corridors between these refugia seem to be routes by which people kept in contact and they seem to have been the basis for what are now called Songlines today With the end of the ice age strong rains returned until around 5500 years ago when the wet season cycle in the north ended bringing with it a megadrought that lasted 1500 years The return of reliable rains around 4000 years BP gave Australia its current climate

Following the Ice Age Aboriginal people around the coast from Arnhem Land the Kimberley and the southwest of Western Australia all tell stories of former territories that were drowned beneath the sea with the rising coastlines after the Ice Age It was this event that isolated the Tasmanian Aboriginal people on their island and probably led to the extinction of Aboriginal cultures on the Bass Strait Islands and Kangaroo Island in South Australia In the interior the end of the Ice Age may have led to the recolonisation of the desert and semidesert areas by Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory This in part may have been responsible for the spread of languages of the PamaNyungan language family and secondarily responsible for the spread of male initiation rites involving circumcision There has been a long history of contact between Papuan peoples of the Western Province Torres Strait Islanders and the Aboriginal people in Cape York

The Aboriginal Australians lived through great climatic changes and adapted successfully to their changing physical environment There is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment One controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the marsupial megafauna also see Australian megafauna Some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna Others claim that because the megafauna were large and slow they were easy prey for human hunters A third possibility is that human modification of the environment particularly through the use of fire indirectly led to their extinction Oral history demonstrates the continuity of culture of Indigenous Australians for at least 10000 years This is shown by correlation of oral history stories with verifiable incidents including known changes in sea levels and their associated large changes in location of ocean shorelines oral records of megafauna and comets

The introduction of the dingo possibly as early as 3500 BCE showed that contact with South East Asian peoples continued as the closest genetic connection to the dingo seems to be the wild dogs of Thailand This contact was not just oneway as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates Dingoes began and evolved in Asia The earliest known dingolike fossils are from Ban Chiang in northeast Thailand dated at 5500 years BP and from north Vietnam 5000 years BP According to skull morphology these fossils occupy a place between Asian wolves prime candidates were the pale footed or Indian wolf Canis lupus pallipes and the Arabian wolf Canis lupus arabs and modern dingoes in Australia and Thailand

Most scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the Australian Aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of firestick farming that was responsible for these extinctions Fossil research published in 2017 indicates that Aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for at least 17000 years Aboriginal Australians used fire for a variety of purposes to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires to make travel easier to eliminate pests for ceremonial purposes for warfare and just to clean up country There is disagreement however about the extent to which this burning led to largescale changes in vegetation patterns

Aboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area but they knew exactly when where and how to find everything edible Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be wellbalanced with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend But food was not obtained without effort In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to twothirds of each day hunting or foraging for food Each day the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons Larger animals and birds such as kangaroos and emus were speared or disabled with a thrown club boomerang or stone Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey The men were excellent trackers and stalkers approaching their prey running where there was cover or freezing and crawling when in the open They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell

Fish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them Fish spears nets wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas Lines with hooks made from bone shell wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts Dugong turtle and large fish were harpooned the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust The mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region While Torres Strait Island populations were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods most Aboriginal Australians were huntergatherers Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights

In presentday Victoria for example there were two separate communities with an economy based on eelfarming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems one on the Murray River in the states north the other in the southwest near Hamilton in the territory of the Djab Wurrung which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area see Gunditjmara A primary tool used in hunting is the spear launched by a woomera or spearthrower in some locales Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians The nonreturnable boomerang known more correctly as a Throwing Stick more powerful than the returning kind could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo

On mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo was domesticated however domestic pigs were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods such as pig kangaroo emu wombats goanna snakes birds many insects such as honey ants Bogong moths and witchetty grubs Many varieties of plant foods such as taro coconuts nuts fruits and berries were also eaten

Permanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semipermanent villages most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence Most Indigenous communities were seminomadic moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory following seasonal food sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year From the examination of middens archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time Rock painting at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods There is also prominent rock paintings found in the Sydney basin area which date to around 5000 years

Harry Lourandos has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of huntergatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment for example the construction of eel traps in Victoria population growth an increase in trade between groups a more elaborate social structure and other cultural changes A shift in stone tool technology involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers occurred around this time This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo

Many Indigenous communities also have a very complex kinship structure and in some places strict rules about marriage In traditional societies men are required to marry women of a specific moiety The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities To enable men and women to find suitable partners many groups would come together for annual gatherings commonly known as corroborees at which goods were traded news exchanged and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented inbreeding in a society based on small seminomadic groups

In 1770 Lieutenant James Cook wrote that he had claimed the east coast of Australia for the United Kingdom and named it New South Wales while on Possession Island off the west coast of Cape York Peninsula However it seems that no such claim was made when Cook was in Australia Cook was not authorized to make such a claim and Joseph Banks who was standing beside Cook does not mention the event Furthermore Cooks purported declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the inhabitants if any and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788 

The first apparent consequence of British settlement appeared in April 1789 when a disease which was probably smallpox struck the Aborigines about Port Jackson Thereafter other European epidemic diseases arrived such as chickenpox influenza and measles which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement The worsthit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities where disease could spread more readily In the arid centre of the continent where small communities were spread over a vast area the population decline was less marked Disease was the principal cause of population decline

The second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else In fact the loss of traditional lands food sources and water resources was often fatal particularly to communities already weakened by disease Additionally Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and wellbeing of the group could not be maintained Proximity to settlers also brought venereal disease to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates Settlers also brought alcohol opium and tobacco and substance abuse has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace often before European settlers arrived or recorded their existence

Deadly infectious diseases like smallpox influenza and tuberculosis were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths 
Smallpox alone killed more than 50 of the Aboriginal population 

In April 1789 a major outbreak of smallpox killed large numbers of Indigenous Australians between Hawkesbury River Broken Bay and Port Hacking Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the First Fleet it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it Unable to understand or counter the sickness they often fled leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves As the clans fled the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society with many of the productive hunters and gatherers dead those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve

Lieutenant William Bradley recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet these were subsequently dismissed by SurgeonGeneral John White who believed they were suffering from slight inflammatory complaints

Some commentators such as Judy Campbell have suggested that Makasar fishermen accidentally brought smallpox to Australias north and the virus travelled south However given that the spread of the disease depends on high population densities and the fact that those who succumbed were soon incapable of walking such an outbreak was unlikely to have spread across the desert trade routes A more likely source of the disease was the variolas matter Surgeon John White brought with him on the First Fleet although it is unknown how this may have been spread It has been speculated that the vials were either accidentally or intentionally released it as a biological weapon Some researchers such as Seth Carus and Chris Warren suggest that the infection was deliberate In 2014 writing in Journal of Australian Studies Christopher Warren concluded that British marines were most likely to have spread smallpox possibly without informing Governor Phillip but conceded in his conclusion that todays evidence only provides for a balancing of probabilities and this is all that can be attempted

On the mainland prolonged conflict followed the frontier of European settlement In 1834 John Dunmore Lang wrote There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains In 1790 an Aboriginal leader Pemulwuy in Sydney resisted the Europeans waging a guerrillastyle warfare on the settlers in a series of wars known as the Hawkesbury and Nepean Wars which spanned 26 years from 1790 to 1816 In 1838 twenty eight Aboriginal people were killed at the Myall Creek massacre seven of the convict settlers responsible six white men and one African man were tried convicted and hung for the murders Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers such as the Noongar of southwestern Australia led by Yagan who was killed in 1833 The Kalkadoon of Queensland also resisted the settlers and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884 There was a massacre at Coniston in the Northern Territory in 1928 Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate with a figure of around 10000  20000 deaths being advanced by historians such as Henry Reynolds However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts forcing historians to estimate a countrywide whiteblack death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths Reynolds and other historians estimate that up to 3000 white people were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement

The Palawa or Indigenous people of Tasmania were particularly hardhit Nearly all of them apparently numbering somewhere between 2000 and 15000 when white settlement began were dead by the 1870s It is widely claimed that this was the result of a genocidal policy in the form of the Black War Other historians dispute this Geoffrey Blainey wrote that in Tasmania by 1830 Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating Josephine Flood wrote The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones Historian Keith Windschuttle also disagrees that violence was the principal cause He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 180347 that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in selfdefence by settlers Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzleloading singleshot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict Another scholar H A Willis has subsequently disputed Windschuttles figures and has documented 188 Palawa killed by settlers in 180334 alone with possibly another 145 killed during the same period Such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates It is also claimed but untrue that the last Aboriginal Tasmanian was Truganini who died in 1876 This belief stems from a distinction between full bloods and half castes that is now generally regarded as racist Palawa people survived in missions set up on the islands of Bass Strait
Nevertheless some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful starting with the Guugu Yimithirr people who met James Cook near Cooktown in 1770 Bennelong served as interlocutor between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England staying there between 1792 and 1795 Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers such as John King who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the illfated Burke and Wills expedition of 1861 Also living with Indigenous people was William Buckley an escaped convict who was with the Wautharong people near Melbourne for thirtytwo years before being found in 1835 Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture working as stock hands or labourers The first Australian cricket team which toured England in 1868 was principally made up of Indigenous players

As the European pastoral industries developed several economic changes came about The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers anger by hunting livestock The impact of disease and the settlers industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians way of life With the exception of a few in the remote interior all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood

In southeastern Australia during the 1850s large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the Australian goldrushes Indigenous women men and children became a significant source of labour Most Indigenous labour was unpaid instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food clothing and other basic necessities In the later 19th century settlers made their way north and into the interior appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use waterholes and soaks in particular and introducing sheep rabbits and cattle all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle incurring the wrath of graziers after they replaced the native animals as a food source As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia Indigenous workers were quickly recruited Several other outback industries notably pearling also employed Aboriginal workers

In many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children In some places colonial governments provided some resources

In spite of the impact of disease violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century In 1914 around 800 Aboriginal people answered the call to arms to fight in World War I despite restrictions on Indigenous Australians serving in the military As the war continued these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed Many enlisted by claiming they were Mori or Indian

By the 1920s the Indigenous population had declined to between 50000 and 90000 and the belief that the Indigenous Australians would soon die out was widely held even among Australians sympathetic to their situation But by about 1930 those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances From the 1940s the availability of penicillin to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline

In the Northern Territory significant frontier conflict continued Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of World War II in 1939 It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period One particular series of killings became known as the Caledon Bay crisis and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians

In the early 20th century anthropologists influence dominated societys view of aboriginals in Australia They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms In the mid1920s there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by fieldwork New studies described aboriginals social organisation religious belief and practice Alfred RadcliffeBrown the father of modern social anthropology published his Social Organization of Australian Tribes in 1931

By the end of World War II many Indigenous men had served in the military and were paid an equitable salary However Aboriginal workers remained unfree labourers paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations and had their movements severely restricted by regulations andor police action On 4 February 1939 Jack Patten led a strike at Cummeragunja Mission in New South Wales The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control and residents were forced to subsist on meager rations Approximately 200 people left their homes taking part in the Cummeragunja walkoff and the majority crossed the border into Victoria never to return home

On 1 May 1946 Aboriginal peoples station workers in the buetiful region of Western Australia started the 1946 Pilbara strike and never returned to work Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal Pastoral Industry Award of 1968 which required the payment of a minimum wage to Aboriginal station workers as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government Many of the workers and their families became refugees or fringe dwellers living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities

In 1949 the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces or were enrolled to vote in state elections At that time those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections

All Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the Menzies government in 1962 The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in November 1963 The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965

The 1967 referendum passed with a 90 majority allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliaments power to make special laws for specific races and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australias referendums

In 1971 Yolngu people at Yirrkala sought an injunction against Nabalco to cease mining on their traditional land In the resulting historic and controversial Gove land rights case Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been terra nullius before European settlement and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law Although the Yolngu people were defeated in this action the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law which led first to the Woodward Commission and then to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act

In 1972 the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on the steps of Parliament House in Canberra in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were strangers in their own country A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site

In 1975 the Whitlam government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people After the dismissal of the Whitlam government by the GovernorGeneral a reducedscope version of the Act known as the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 was introduced by the coalition government led by Malcolm Fraser While its application was limited to the Northern Territory it did grant inalienable freehold title to some traditional lands

In 1984 a group of Pintupi people who were living a traditional huntergatherer desertdwelling life were tracked down in the Gibson Desert in Western Australia and brought into a settlement They are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe in Australia

A 1987 federal government report described the history of the Aboriginal Homelands Movement or Return to Country movement as a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the remote areas of Australia to leave government settlements reserves missions and nonAboriginal townships and to reoccupy their traditional country

In 1992 the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the Mabo Case declaring the previous legal concept of terra nullius to be invalid This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise Native Title claims over land in Australia

In 1998 as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children see Stolen generation from their families a National Sorry Day was instituted to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families Many politicians from both sides of the house participated with the notable exception of the Prime Minister John Howard

In 1999 a referendum was held to change the Australian Constitution to include a preamble that amongst other topics recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement This referendum was defeated though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic

In 2004 the Australian Government abolished The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission ATSIC which had been Australias top Indigenous organisation The Commonwealth cited corruption and in particular made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSICs chairman Geoff Clark as the principal reason Indigenous specific programmes have been mainstreamed that is reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population The Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination was established within the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and now with the Department of Families Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to coordinate a whole of government effort

In June 2005 Richard Frankland founder of the Your Voice political party in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard advocated that the eighteenthcentury conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the Australian War Memorial In its editorial on 20 June 2005 Melbourne newspaper The Age said that Frankland has raised an important question and asked whether moving work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land  to the War Memorial would change the way we regard Aboriginal history

In 2008 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a formal apology for the Stolen Generations

The Virginia First District started in 1788 covering the counties of Berkeley Frederick Hampshire Hardy Harrison Monongalia Ohio Randolph and Shenandoah Of these only Shenandoah and Frederick Counties are in Virginia today the rest are now part of West Virginia The modern counties of Clarke Warren and most of Page as well as the independent city of Winchester were included as part of Frederick and Shenandoah counties in 1788 In West Virginia all the current state north and east of a generalized line running from Wood County to Pocahontas County was in the congressional district The one exception was that Pendleton County West Virginia was in Virginias 3rd congressional district

In the redistribution which followed the 1850 census in force 18531863 the First District comprised sixteen counties in eastern Virginia The counties included amongst others Accomack Essex Gloucester James City King and Queen Mathews Middlesex New Kent Richmond Warwick and Westmoreland In an 1862 Union special election three out of the sixteen counties in the Union district supplied returns

The First District is noted for its strong presence of military institutions including the Naval Surface Warfare Center Increasing numbers of military and retired voters have swung the district to the right

<doc id="7705906" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7705906" title="MetaChlorophenylpiperazine">
MetaChlorophenylpiperazine
metaChlorophenylpiperazine mCPP is a psychoactive drug of the phenylpiperazine class It was initially developed in the late1970s and used in scientific research before being sold as a designer drug in the mid2000s It has been detected in pills touted as legal alternatives to illicit stimulants in New Zealand and pills sold as ecstasy in Europe and the United States

Despite its advertisement as a recreational substance mCPP is actually generally considered to be an unpleasant experience and is not desired by drug users It lacks any reinforcing or hallucinogenic effects produces dysphoric depressive and anxiogenic effects in rodents and humans and can induce panic attacks in individuals susceptible to them It also worsens obsessivecompulsive symptoms in people with the disorder

mCPP is known to induce headaches in humans and has been used for testing potential antimigraine medications It has potent anorectic effects and has encouraged the development of selective 5HT receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity as well

mCPP possesses significant affinity for the 5HT 5HT 5HT 5HT 5HT 5HT 5HT and 5HT receptors as well as the SERT It also has some affinity for adrenergic adrenergic H I and NET It behaves as an agonist at most serotonin receptors mCPP has been shown to act not only as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor but as a serotonin releasing agent as well

mCPPs strongest actions are at the 5HT and 5HT receptors and its discriminative cue is mediated primarily by 5HT Its negative effects such as anxiety headaches and appetite loss are likely mediated by its actions on the 5HT receptor Other effects of mCPP include nausea hypoactivity and penile erection the latter two the result of increased 5HT activity and the former likely via 5HT stimulation

In comparison studies mCPP has approximately 10fold selectivity for the human 5HT receptor over the human 5HT and 5HT receptors K  34nM vs 321 and 288nM It acts as a partial agonist of the human 5HT receptor but as an antagonist of the human 5HT and 5HT receptors In accordance with its lack of agonism towards the human 5HT receptor there are no reports that mCPP produces hallucinogenic effects in humans

mCPP is metabolized via the CYP2D6 isoenzyme by hydroxylation to parahydroxymCPP pOHmCPP Caution should be exercised in coprescribing inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 with drugs such as trazodone and nefazodone that have mCPP as a metabolite

mCPP is a metabolite of a variety of other piperazine drugs including trazodone nefazodone etoperidone enpiprazole mepiprazole cloperidone peraclopone and BRL15572 It is formed by dealkylation via CYP3A4

Analogues of mCPP include


Some additional analogues include quipazine ORG12962 and 3CPEP

mCPP is illegal in Belgium

mCPP is illegal in Brazil

mCPP is not a controlled drug in Canada

As of October 2015 mCPP is a controlled substance in China

mCPP is legal in the Czech Republic

mCPP is illegal in Denmark

mCPP is illegal in Finland

mCPP is illegal in Germany

mCPP is illegal in Hungary since 2012

mCPP is illegal in Japan since 2006

mCPP is legal in the Netherlands

Based on the recommendation of the EACD the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP along with the other piperazine derivatives TFMPP mCPP pFPP MeOPP and MBZP into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18 2007 but the law change did not go through until the following year and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008 An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs remained until October 2008 at which point they became completely illegal However it is important to note that mCPP is legally used for scientific research

mCPP is illegal in Norway

mCPP is illegal in Russia

mCPP is illegal in Sweden

mCPP is illegal in Poland

mCPP is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States but it is possible that it could be considered a controlled substance analog of BZP in which case purchase sale or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act

However chlorophenylpiperazine is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy sell or possess in this state

Virginias 3rd congressional district
Virginias third congressional district is a United States congressional district in the Commonwealth of Virginia serving the independent cities of Franklin Newport News and Portsmouth parts of the independent cities of Chesapeake Hampton Norfolk and Suffolk and all of the county of Isle of Wight The current representative is Robert C Scott D

The Virginia Legislatures 2012 redistricting was found unconstitutional and replaced with a courtordered redistricting on January 16 2016 for the 2016 elections One reason for the redistricting is the racial gerrymandering From 1993 to 2016 the 3rd had covered most of the majorityblack precincts in and around Hampton Roads and Richmond The courtdrawn map shifted the area near Richmond to the 4th District The dispute over the district borders went to the US Supreme Court in Wittman v Personhuballah

In 1788 Virginias 3rd Congressional District consisted of all of modern Virginia including and west of the counties of Carroll Floyd Roanoke Botetourt Augusta and Rockingham It also included what is today Pendleton County West Virginia and also about the southern third of West Virginia which in 1788 was all Greenbrier County This area that is today about 48 counties and 13 independent cities was in 1788 only nine counties

In the 1790 census this area had a population of 66045

For the 1792 congressional elections the number of congressional districts in Virginia rose from 10 to 19 The only county that remained in the third district was Pendleton County Harrison Randolph Hardy Hampshire Monongalia and Ohio Counties all now in West Virginia were also in the district This was all of northern West Virginia except the far eastern panhandle area The new districts 1790 population was 30145

The 1800 Census lead to another increase in Virginias congressional districts in 1802 The third district was again moved this time to what was then Frederick and Shenandoah Counties in Virginia which besides those counties also included the modern counties of Clarke Warren and part of Page The new 3rd district had a population of 38767 in 1800

For most of the time from the end of the Civil War to 1993 the 3rd District was a relatively compact district centered on Richmond

The districts current configuration dates to 1993 when the Justice Department ordered Virginia to create a majorityminority district At that time portions of the old 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th districts were combined to create a new 3rd District

As of 2016 the 3rd district has been ruled unconstitutional The new map gave the 3rd a slight plurality of blacks

Crispy Crunch
Crispy Crunch is a hard chocolate bar with a crispy peanut flake inside that is made by Cadbury in Canada Harold Oswin an employee of William Neilson developed Crispy Crunch in 1930

Harold Oswin was a candy roller in Neilsons hard candy room and joined the company when he was fourteen years old Harold was promoted to Candy maker in the late 1920s He always had wanted to create a candy bar with peanut butter and so when a chocolate bar contest was announced he submitted his concept Harold won the contest and received a 500 prize The original recipe called for a logshaped bar Williams Neilson management made the decision to flatten the bar to the shape that it is today Oswin died in the mid1990s

The brand was repositioned in 1988 by Norm Williams Director of Marketing The new brief was given to Martin Shewchuck of Leo Burnett Canada who conceived the highly successful Crispy Crunch campaigns the only thing better than your Crispy Crunch is someone elses The campaign catapulted the brand from No 10 to No 1 growing volume by 55

Crispy Crunches were sold in the United States for a brief time in the 1990s by the food distribution arm of Pro Set the collectible card company Pro Set went bankrupt resulting in Crispy Crunch no longer being available in the United States A lowercalorie version of Crispy Crunch was available for a limited time in the mid1990s

The original manufacturers Neilson sold its chocolate brands to Cadbury in 1996 though packaging continued to feature the Neilson logo for a few years Since Cadbury began manufacturing of the chocolate bar the recipe has changed in that it is less salty and more sweet as it has more of the crunchy topazcoloured candy coating around the centre

Modal dispersion is a distortion mechanism occurring in multimode fibers and other waveguides in which the signal is spread in time because the propagation velocity of the optical signal is not the same for all modes Other names for this phenomenon include multimode distortion multimode dispersion modal distortion intermodal distortion intermodal dispersion and intermodal delay distortion

In the ray optics analogy modal dispersion in a stepindex optical fiber may be compared to multipath propagation of a radio signal Rays of light enter the fiber with different angles to the fiber axis up to the fibers acceptance angle Rays that enter with a shallower angle travel by a more direct path and arrive sooner than rays that enter at a steeper angle which reflect many more times off the boundaries of the core as they travel the length of the fiber The arrival of different components of the signal at different times distorts the shape 

Modal dispersion limits the bandwidth of multimode fibers For example a typical stepindex fiber with a 50m core would be limited to approximately 20MHz for a one kilometer length in other words a bandwidth of 20MHzkm Modal dispersion may be considerably reduced but never completely eliminated by the use of a core having a graded refractive index profile However multimode gradedindex fibers having bandwidths exceeding 35GHzkm at 850nm are now commonly manufactured for use in 10 Gbits data links 

Modal dispersion should not be confused with chromatic dispersion a distortion that results due to the differences in propagation velocity of different wavelengths of light Modal dispersion occurs even with an ideal monochromatic light source 

A special case of modal dispersion is polarization mode dispersion PMD a fiber dispersion phenomenon usually associated with singlemode fibers PMD results when two modes that normally travel at the same speed due to fiber core geometric and stress symmetry for example two orthogonal polarizations in a waveguide of circular or square crosssection travel at different speeds due to random imperfections that break the symmetry

In multimode optical fiber with many wavelengths propagating it is sometimes hard to identify the dispersed wavelength out of all the wavelengths that are present if there is not yet a service degradation issue One can compare the present optical power of each wavelength to the designed values and look for differences After that the optical fiber is tested end to end If no loss is found then most probably there is dispersion with that particular wavelength Normally engineers start testing the fiber section by section until they reach the affected section all wavelengths are tested and the affected wavelength produces a loss at the far end of the fiber One can easily calculate how much of the fiber is affected and replace that part of fiber with a new one Replacement of optical fiber is only required when there is an intense dispersion and service is being affected otherwise various methods can be used to compensate for the dispersion

lvaro Alsogaray
lvaro Carlos Alsogaray June 22 1913  April 1 2005 was an Argentine politician and businessman Minister of Economy during much of the 195962 period he was one of the principal proponents of economic conservatism in modern Argentina

Alsogaray was born in Esperanza Santa Fe in 1913 as the eldest of three children to Julia Elisa Bosch and lvaro Alsogaray Born to a prominent local military family Alsogaray graduated from the National Military College as an infantry officer He studied military engineering in the Armys School of Higher Technical Studies and civil and aeronautical engineer at the National University of Crdoba He married Edith Gay in 1940 and had two sons and a daughter

He retired from the army with the rank of captain and with two engineering degrees which led to his being called el capitn ingeniero He entered business becoming an important contractor for State enterprises such as FAMA a predecessor of flag carrier Aerolneas Argentinas and briefly served as its director during the presidency of Juan Pern whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to Alsogarays thinking

After the coup that removed Pern in 1955 he held the posts of Undersecretary of Commerce and Minister of Industry and maintained numerous Peronist staffers at the Undersecretariat despite his support for the coup He founded the Independent Civic Party in 1956 the party fared modestly in the 1958 elections

To placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives the otherwise progressive Arturo Frondizi named Alsogaray Minister of the Economy in early 1959 Inheriting large trade deficits Alsogaray sharply devalued the peso and imposed severe credit controls on Argentinas large public banks Declaring that the economy must go through winter the austerity measures were a boon to exporters  but caused consumer prices to double in 1959 and real wages and construction to fall by about 20 The resulting trade surplus and progrowth policies pursued by Frondizis unofficial point man on the economy Rogelio Julio Frigerio both contributed to a robust recovery in 1960 and 1961

Marginalized in favor of Frigerio after the 1959 recession and deeply unpopular Alsogaray resigned early in 1961 Frigerio had been President Frondizis first choice for the critical Economy Ministry an appointment thwarted by the military Frondizi and Frigerio later founded the MID a political party centered around the need for accelerated development

Frondizis efforts to mediate differences between the United States and Cuba ultimately resulted in a March 1962 coup dtat and lvaro Alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother General Julio Alsogaray to secure several ministerial and planning posts under Frondizis militaryappointed successor Senate President Jos Mara Guido Reintroducing many of his restrictive 1959 policies as well as nearly worthless Ninth of July bonds which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public employees and government contractors the economy again slipped into severe recession the trade balance improved albeit the cost of depressed business investment

Out of power after the election of Dr Arturo Illia in 1963 Alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed Finding allies in conservative business and media interests the powerful Roman Catholic Church and his influential brother Julio Alsogaray and other Illia opponents were successful Following the 1966 coup against President Illia he was designated Ambassador to the United States a post he held until 1968

Alsogaray founded the New Force in 1972 though like the Independent Civic Party it fared poorly in the 1973 elections that returned Pern to power He was among the few conservative figures to publicly oppose the imminent March 1976 coup but largely supported the subsequent National Reorganization Process As the dictatorship eventually yielded to calls for elections he founded the Union of the Democratic Centre UCeD in 1982 Running as a rightwing economically conservative candidate on the latter ticket he stood for the Presidency in 1983 and 1989 Alsogaray received two million votes 10 in his 1989 presidential bid behind only major party candidates Carlos Menem and Eduardo Angeloz

Continuing to enjoy a measure of support in Buenos Aires affluent northside he and his daughter Mara Julia Alsogaray were elected the only two national deputies for the UCeD in 1983 and he served until 1999 A vehement antiPeronist and antisocialist Alsogaray forged an alliance with the late Juan Perns Justicialist Party in 1989 following their nomination of promarket Governor Carlos Menem and endorsed Justicialist candidate Eduardo Vaca that year in a tightlycontested seat in the Argentine Senate representing the City of Buenos Aires Argentine Senators were indirectly elected at the time and Alsogarays endorsement in the electoral college gave Vaca the seat despite the latters coming in second to centrist UCR candidate Fernando de la Ra The Universidad Francisco Marroqun granted Alsogaray an honorary doctorate in 1985

A vocal supporter of the eras privatizations he prevailed on President Menem to appoint his daughter Mara Julia Secretary of the Environment in which post she served from 1991 to 1999 and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the Menem presidency endorsing the populistturnedconservative president in his 1995 reelection bid Among his most notable roles in this era was as director of a feasibility study in 199596 for the replacement of Buenos Aires two international airports for an island terminal on the Ro de la Plata opposed by de la Ra who had been elected Mayor and would later be President the project never materialized His UCed party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies as because of rivalries in the party itself  notably between his daughter and Adelina DAlessio de Viola whom he had Menem appoint as head of the National Mortgage Bank Commenting on the dispute he remarked that would it that ones political party could do without affiliatesor women 

Alsogaray who perennially sought television airtime lived out his last few years in seclusion He lost his wife in 2004 and died in Buenos Aires the following year at the age of 91 Adamantly conservative he was of the opinion that if anything the 197683 dictatorship was too moderate He felt that some of the most brutal torturers during Dirty War such as Alfredo Astiz were heroes and even once attempted to use his influence over the Menem administration to have a monument built in their honor

Footsteps in the Dark
Footsteps in the Dark is a 1977 slow jam recorded by The Isley Brothers as an album track featured on the groups doubleplatinum album Go For Your Guns It was the Bside to Groove with You which reached 16 on the RB singles chart Track also noted Ron Isleys growing transition into singing more ballads compared to the bands more funk approach 
While the song didnt chart on either the pop or RB singles chart it still garnered popularity initially for its laidback grooves and the solemn lyrics the song discussed infidelity and later would be the basis of a sample years later first by rap group Comptons Most Wanted on their album Straight Checkn Em on the track Can I Kill It and rapper Ice Cube who used the musical instrumental of the song for his breakthrough hit It Was a Good Day While the song is well noted for its unique guitar timbre which can be heard on other Isley Brother tracks such as Voyage to Atlantis However the track is most commonly sampled for its unique syncopated drum riff 

The song was again sampled by Black Milk on Slum Villages 2005 selftitled album on the track Call Me which featured RB singer Dwele and HipHop producer J Dilla reworked it into Wont Do on his posthumous album The Shining Singer kos used a spedup sample from the song for his 2002 single Heaven Only Knows from his album Exit 

Although lesser known the song was also sampled by Usher on his second album My Way in the song One Day Youll Be Mine The song is also sampled on the Rhymefest song All Girls Cheat from his 2006 album Blue Collar although the portion of the song used is sung by Mario and not a sample of the original recording Alicia Keys heavily sampled on her song A Womans Worth recorded for her 2005 live album Unplugged The song was also sampled by Raheem DeVaughn on Until a song from his debut album The Love Experience Thundercats Them Changes from his 2015 record The Beyond  Where the Giants Roam also quotes the famous drum kit opening of the song

Ernie Isleys playing on this track is heavily influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix whose first recording session was actually with the Isley Brothers in 1964 with the track Testify 

Ernie Isley not only played guitar but also played drums and wrote the lyrics to Footsteps in the Dark The verse of the song is written in the key of Dmajor

Professional organizing
Professional Organizing emerged as an industry in 1984 within Los Angeles It intends to assist individuals and businesses to improve their organizing systems and process for the purpose of improving quality of life increasing personal productivity and achieving greater efficiency

The National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals NAPO is recognised as the largest professional association within this industry with approximately 3500 members

This industry has been popularised by a number of television programs produced on the subject beginning with Life Laundry in 2002 This was followed by other programs such as Clean Sweep Neat  Hoarding Buried Alive Hoarders and  Professional organizing has also been the basis of magazines like Real Simple

NAPO defines Professional Organizer and Productivity Consultant as follows

Certified Professional Organizers CPOs have proven industry proficiency by demonstrating they possess the body of knowledge and experience essential to professional organizing and productivity consulting The CPO credential identifies professional organizers whove documented a specific number of paid hours that include transferring organizing skills to the client and passed the Board of Certification for Professional Organizers BCPO examination The credential provides the organizing and productivity industry a way to elevate its professional standards

The National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals education arm is known as NAPO University Currently NAPO University offers two Specialist Certificates Residential Organizing and Workplace Productivity A third Specialist Certificate in Life Transitions will be launched in early 2018 NAPO University also offers a Business Resources Track to support Professional Organizers and Productivity Consultants in developing and growing their businesses

Professional Organizers achieve the goal of creating and maintaining organizational systems by teaching others the basic principals of organization Writer Julie Morgenstern suggests communicating these principals by using the acronym SPACE interpreted as SSort PPurge AAssign a Home CContainerize and EEqualize The last step E consists in monitoring how the new system that has been created is working adjusting it if needed and maintaining it This principle is applicable to every type of organization

As one of their main jobs Professional Organizers help clients reduce excessive clutter paper books clothing shoes office supplies home decor items etc in the home or in the office Professional Organizers endeavor to help individuals and business owners take control of their surroundings their time their paper and their systems for life Professional Organizers help redirect paradigms into more useful crossapplications that ensure properly cosustainable futures for their clients spaces and processes

Professional Organizers offer a wide variety of services from designing a functional closet to organizing a crosscountry move For homeowners a Professional Organizer might plan and reorganize the space of a room improve paper management or coach in timemanagement or goalsetting In a business setting Professional Organizers work closely with their clients to increase productivity by streamlining paperfiling electronic organization and employee timemanagement

San Agustinillo
San Agustinillo is a small fishing village and beach in the state of Oaxaca Mexico It is located in the municipality of Santa Mara Tonameca just east of the coastal communities of Mazunte and La Ventanilla This is where the Sierra Madre del Sur mountains meet the Pacific Ocean

San Agustinillo is connected by a road to Zipolite and Puerto ngel to the west All these coastal communities together are known as the Riviera Oaxaquea or La Costa Chica Oaxaquea

The local Highway 175 makes a loop south from the main coastal Highway 200 From Pochutla Highway 175 first goes south to Puerto ngel then west along the coast to Zipolite San Agustinillo and Mazunte After that it continues back north again to rejoin the main Highway 200 The local collectivos buses make trips from Pochutla in both directions

The community was established about the same time as Mazunte Fishermen in San Augustinillo made a living by hunting sea turtles until this was banned in 1990 Major economic activities here for most residents are still agriculture and small scale fishing with some tourism based on the beach

The beach of San Agustinillo is about 1300 meters long facing open ocean and divided into three sections by rocky outcroppings that jut out from the beach into the Pacific Ocean The sands of the beach are medium grain of gold color and spread as wide as fifty meters The waters just offshore are warm with green and blue tones The far west end is called Playa Rinconcito which is relatively wellsheltered and considered safest for swimming The easternmost section is called Playa Aragon and has both strong waves and strong undertow As these beaches face open ocean caution is advised especially when tropical waves and other weather phenomena cause abnormally high waves which can cause beach restrictions and closures In 2009 at least three drownings were reported off this beach including a sixyearold girl who was caught while on the shoreline by an unusually high wave A nineteenyearold was dragged out to sea when he was surprised by an undercurrent and his body was not found until five days later

The fishing village is located at the far west end at Playa Rinconcito The fishermen offer boat tours of the area as well as rental for sportsfishing Just immediately to the east of the village are palapas but almost nothing has been built at the far eastern end From June to December it is possible to see Olive Ridley turtles laying their eggs on this beach

The beach is encroached by hills and steep cliffs that make the building of large hotels and other resort features impossible However the shoreline and some of the hills surrounding it are dotted with small rustic establishments which show ecological and European influence The European influence is because a number of establishments here are owned by Italians and some French Restaurants include La Termita owned by an ItalianArgentinian and Tio Nerone owned by an ItalianGerman The Mexico Lindo hotel on the beach is owned by a Mexican from Tabasco by the name of Fausto and also serves Italian food along with Regional favorites Another Italianowned lodging is the Posada La Termita also on the waterfront Casa Pan de Miel has a French owner It is not on the beach but on a hilltop overlooking the area

Since the area emphasizes eco tourism many of the lodgings here were built as lowimpact that blend in with the topography One of this is La Posada del Arquitecto which is carved into the rocks of Playa Rinconcito The rooms have hanging beds and a shower built into a tree trunk Everything is constructed with wooden pegs instead of nails Many of the lodgings here do not have websites or even phones but are popular with backpackers nonetheless None have running hot water Most hotels do not have televisions phone or wireless connections or air conditioning

The library of San Agustinillo is called Las cuatro amigas referring to the four women who opened it in the Casa Municipal municipal office building on Highway 175 The library is free to residents and tourists may borrow books for a nominal fee About half the collection is in Spanish about half in English and the rest in other languages such as French and German The library also offers English classes for the children of the town The organization that runs the library has a website at La Biblioteca de San Agustinillo

Charitable Uses Act 1601
The Charitable Uses Act of 1601 known as the Statute of Elizabeth is an Act 43 Eliz I c4 of the Parliament of England It was repealed by section 131 of the Mortmain and Charitable Uses Act 1888 c42 but see section 132 of that Act

The preamble to the act contained a list of purposes or activities that was in effect a list of purposes or activities that the State believed were of general benefit to society and to which the State wanted to encourage private contributions The list has formed the foundation of the modern definition of charitable purposes which has developed through case law This has come about because the courts in considering whether or not a particular purpose was charitable in law have tended to look for an analogy between the purpose under consideration and the list and to recognise the purpose as charitable if an analogy with the 1601 list could be found

Scenic Rim
The Scenic Rim is a group of forested mountain ranges of the Great Dividing Range straddling the border between southeastern Queensland and northeastern New South Wales Australia

The mountainous landscape forms a quarter circle ridge positioned roughly from south of Toowoomba around to Springbrook Tamborine Mountain Levers Plateau and the Lamington Plateau are part of the rim formation The scenic rim is considered part of the Gold Coast hinterland Parts of the rim are well developed crossed by highways with facilities for tourists like Cunninghams Gap others are privately owned agricultural properties and rural villages such as Beechmont and Tamborine Mountain Much of the rest is protected in national parks and nature reserves

The ranges include the Little Liverpool Range Main Range Mistake Ranges McPherson Range Teviot Range and the Tweed Range Valleys of the Scenic Rim include Laidley Creek Christmas Creek Lockyer Valley Fassifern Valley Numinbah Valley the Albert River Logan River Coomera River and the Bremer River

The geology and landscape of the Scenic Rim is largely volcanic in origin deriving from the prehistoric Tweed Volcano including the Mount Warning shield volcano and the Focal Peak and Main Range volcanic rocks Some areas of sedimentary origin include parts of Mount Barney and eastern Lamington national parks The deeply weathered mainly basaltic soils support rainforest and vine thicket ecosystems as well as rare eucalypt and grassland communities The area has a subtropical climate with at the lowest altitudes average minimum winter temperatures of 6C average maximum summer temperatures of 29C and average annual rainfall of 1555mm

Areas protected in national parks and other conservation reserves include the Border Ranges National Park Glen Rock Regional Park Koreelah National Park Lamington National Park Limpinwood Nature Reserve Main Range National Park Mebbin National Park Moogerah Peaks National Park Mount Barney National Park Mount Chinghee National Park Mount Clunie National Park Mount Nothofagus National Park Mount Warning National Park Numinbah Nature Reserve and Springbrook National Park Parts of the Scenic Rim are listed as a World Heritage site and some are designated Wilderness Areas

A 1351km area encompassing the Scenic Rim has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area IBA because it supports populations of endangered eastern bristlebirds blackbreasted buttonquails rufous scrubbirds Alberts lyrebirds paleyellow robins paradise riflebirds green catbirds regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners There are also historical and recent sight records of the critically endangered Coxens fig parrot

There are many recreational activities for daytrippers rockclimbers hikers and nature lovers on the ranges The concept of the Scenic Rim was first described by Arthur Groom and Romeo Lahey in the 1920s They were campaigning for the protection of the forests from Main Range to the Lamington Plateau At about the same time the Binna Burra lodge and OReillys Guesthouse were established as the popularity of the area grew with tourists

James Joseph Hines
James Joseph Hines December 18 1876  March 26 1957 was a Democratic Party politician and one of the most powerful leaders of Tammany Hall in New York City

In his early years Hines acted as a caretaker to residents in New Yorks Eleventh Assembly District This helped him win support and influence over the areas residents In the 1920s and 1930s Hines maintained absolute power over his district and was arguably the most powerful political boss in Tammany Hall

Jimmy Walkers election as Mayor of New York City would also firmly establish Hines influence over the local political scene As boss of Tammany Halls Eleventh Assembly District in uptown Manhattan Hines had access to various sources of wealth and developed close ties with many mobsters such as Lucky Luciano leader of the citys dominant Luciano crime family

In 1932 New York Governor Franklin D Roosevelt ran for President and wanted to weaken Tammany Hall Walker who was tainted by allegations of corruption and was a threat to Roosevelts campaign into resigning Seeing Tammany Hall as a political liability Roosevelt decided to appoint a new mayor a privilege the New York Governor had after any mayor of New York City resigned and focused on backing a candidate who would destroy Tammany Halls power for good

Liberal Republican Fiorello LaGuardia a former Representative and a fierce opponent of Tammany Hall whom Hines had successfully forced from power in the 1932 Congressional election was elected mayor in 1933 and Tammany Halls longtime influence over local politicians faded Hines would not fall After becoming President Roosevelt appointed Hines to oversee the US civil services patronage system for employees in the Manhattan District Hines empire grew soon afterward

In 1938 Hines was accused of being involved in the policy racket with Dutch Schultz who was murdered in 1935 and Dixie Davis and of violating the lottery laws Manhattan District Attorney Thomas E Dewey would successfully get Hines convicted on 13 counts of racketeering Hines provided protection for the policy racket in Harlem and other sections of New York Hines was charged with influencing Magistrates Capshaw and Erwin to throw out policy cases in which the other conspirators had an interest and to influence former District Attorney William C Dodge to go easy on policy prosecutions Hines was alleged to have received a cut in the proceeds of the policy racket

After the first trial ended in a mistrial he was charged again and Charles Cooper Nott Jr presided over the second trial

He died on March 26 1957 at the Long Beach Memorial Hospital

The Midtacular chose to film in Ohio due to that states highly contested and critical role in the outcomes of both the midterm elections held on November 7 2006 and in the 2004 Presidential election another possible reason is that Ohio is located in the Midwestmiddle of the United States in keeping with the middle centric theme Featured candidates from Ohio were the successful Ohio Governors election candidate Ted Strickland and opponent Ken Blackwell and successful Democratic Ohio Senate election candidate Sherrod Brown who went on to defeat incumbent Republican Mike DeWine

It was the fifth time that The Daily Show traveled outside New York City for its Indecision campaign Philadelphia Los Angeles Washington DC and Boston for the 2004 Democratic National Convention have also been featured

<doc id="7706238" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706238" title="Raider Snowmobiles">
Raider Snowmobiles
Raider Snowmobiles were produced by Leisure Vehicles Inc from 19711975 Leisure Vehicles Inc was founded by Bob Bracey who had assisted in developing the legendary Ford Mark IV Le Mans race cars a few years earlier while an engineer at Kar Kraft

Raider snowmobiles are unique for their use of a rearmounted engine twin track design and cockpit seating all of which were revolutionary ideas for the snowmobile industry in the 1970s

The first production model year was 1971 though the sled had been in development since 1969 There were two 1971 models the Raider and the Roamer The 1971 Raider featured a single cylinder JLO 2stroke engine in the beginning of the model year but later may have switched to CCW The 1971 Roamer featured a 10hp Briggs  Stratton 4 cycle engine The production numbers are unknown but it is believed that approximately 50 71 Roamers and 50 71 Raiders were produced 1971 Raiders and Roamers featured a twist grip throttle which was found to be hard to control in bumpy conditions

The 1972 Raider was significantly redesigned from the 1971 model year It was larger longer featured redesigned tracks longer skis and rear shocks along with the leaf sprung rear skids and many more Raider specific manufactured parts For the 1972 model year there were four Raider models the 290 340 400 and 440 The number represents the size of the CCW engine for each model The most common seem to be the 400cc followed by the 290cc This was probably due to engine availability Most have electric starting Some 72 440 models have been found with Hirth engines 400 models are most often found with a standard tachometer and 440 models came standard with a tach and a speedometer

There was a limited production Raider built in 1972 and intended for racing called the Bandit Production is thought to be around 100 units All were put together at a separate facility from the LVI factory It had a lighter weight body front ski shocks the first time on a Raider and a different hatch design that had air scoops instead of a passenger seat The body is black and white and it has a single wide white plastic snow flap with bandit lettered in black and black and white stripes on the front Most Bandits were built with Hirth fan cooled twin cylinder engines but a few have been found with CCW engines Bandits were to be built in 340 400 and 440 models but at least one 650 fan cooled Hirth powered Bandit has been found The Hirth powered Bandits have been found with twin carbs and two small round Donaldson mufflers The Bandits were intended for racing but were found to be too heavy to be competitive All were built by hand so each is a little different The only Bandit seen in Raider advertising is in the background of one artists rendering of a 72 Raider on snow

In 1973 the Raider snowmobile was again completely redesigned There were two models available in 1973 the 34TT and the 44TT The 34TT featured a 32hp 400cc CCW engine No one knows why the 34TT is not called the 40TT or alternatively powered by a 340cc engine It must heve been a last minute change or the fact that the 400cc engine was more readily available 
The 44TT featured a 36hp 440cc CCW engine There are also a few 73 Raiders that have been found with older 72 style 340cc CCW engines in the stripped down version that would be called the Hawk in 1974 
The engine on the 1973 design was tilted to allow for the longer intake on the newer CCW engines with a larger carburetor This had the added benefit of lowering the center of gravity and reducing vibration

The 1974 Raider Snowmobiles experienced a few revisions from the 1973 model The biggest changes were revised graphics on the snowmobile The 1974 model year also marked the change of the Raider lineup into three distinct models the Hawk Eagle and Double Eagle Most 1974 Eagle Raiders are actually unsold 1973 Raider 34TT and 44TT model inventory Many 1973 Raiders had gone unsold due to industry wide overproduction poor snow in most of the midwest and the OPEC oil embargo Raider dealers were sent an upgrade kit with new 1974 style decals the black front applique and a new 1974 owners manual The dealer service bulletin reminded dealers to be sure to remove the 1973 owners manual  replace it with the 1974 owners manual 
The 1974 Hawk was a stripped down Raider model It had no gauges no electric start no front ski shocks no brake lights no hinged gas door cover and no passenger seat It came equipped with a 340cc CCW engine with the 72 Raider style smaller intake and carburator and 72 Raider wiring and chrome brake and throttle controls and the 72 style dash mounted toggle light and high beam switch The 74 Hawk seems to have been a way for LVI to use up leftover 72 Raider parts and at the same time have a cheaper entry level sled
The 1974 Double Eagle was again a completely new redesigned sled It was slightly larger and used a more advanced coil sprung rear suspension technology than the Hawk and Eagle models It also featured an injection molded body hatch and pan and a wider front ski stance This final redesign was intended to reduce the total number of parts needed to build the machine and therefore speed up production 

The 1975 model year was to see the end of Raider production Very few 1975 Raider snowmobiles were manufactured and included a revised 440 Double Eagle that was now burnt orange as opposed to harvest gold as seen in 1974 The 1975 Eagle that was now light blue and powered by a 340cc engine There was no Eagle bird decal on the light blue 75 340s though they are still known as the 75 Eagle for some reason All 1975 Raiders were now powered by Kohler AS2 fan cooled twin cylinder engines with CDI ignition John Deere had negotiated an exclusive contract for CCWKioritz engines forcing LVIRaider to find a new engine source

Leisure Vehicles had intended to create a twoperson sidebyside Raider designated as the Twin Eagle for 1975 but only a few prototypes were built

1975 was a tumultuous year for Leisure Vehicles due to a poor snow season increasing emission and noise level restrictions the departure of Bob Bracey from the company and an industry wide shakeout and contraction As a result of these problems and many others the company halted production on the Raider

Bob Bracey said that total Raider production was about 20000 units

Your Love The Outfield song
Your Love is a song by the English rock band the Outfield taken from their debut album Play Deep 1985 The song was written by the bands guitarist John Spinks

In the United States the song reached 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and 7 on the Mainstream Rock chart in 1986

Your Love became a major hit in the United States It was first released as the second single from Play Deep in November 1985 It was first pushed to albumoriented rock AOR radio to maintain momentum generated by the albums lead single Say It Isnt So After entering the top ten of Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart which measured the playlists of AOR stations across the US Columbia began expanding the song to top 40 radio in February 1986 It then peaked at number seven on the Top Rock Tracks chart during the week of March 1 The song entered the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1986 peaking at number six during the week of May 10 Overall it spent 22 weeks on the Hot 100

Rolling Stone contributor Jimmy Guterman wrote that the track seems to advocate philandering and that the repulsive misogyny contaminates the whole song While Dennis Hunt from the Los Angeles Times criticized the whole of Play Deep as thoroughly derivative music he praised the songs lovely melodic line thats engagingly performed by vocalist Tony Lewis who has obviously been listening to Journeys Steve Perry

The music video has an extended intro and was directed by Jon Jopson The concept for the clip has the band filming a music video for the song and prominently features a painting motif similar to the cover of the album from which the song was taken They perform in front of a backdrop of the Play Deep album cover which is also being fingerpainted offstage by an artist played by actress JoAnn Willette Her character and lead vocalist Tony Lewis appear flirtatious throughout the video Willette was interviewed about her role on the blog Noblemania in 2013 and gave details about the shoot it was shot in Astoria on a soundstage over one day At the end of the video Willette can be seen exiting the studio at dawn the time the production wrapped The band appears mainly as playing the song highlighting their unity as a performing band We didnt want a situation where they had to be actors or something that wasnt what they are said the bands manager Kip Krones at the time

The video was first added to MTVs schedule during the week of 19 February 1986 and began attracting major rotation It peaked at number two on MTVs Top 20 Countdown in late April 1986

Battle of Saltanovka
The Battle of Saltanovka also known as the Battle of Mogilev French Bataille de Mogilev was a battle during the early stages of the 1812 French invasion of Russia

A force of 1700020000 Russian soldiers backed by 90 artillery pieces under Prince Pyotr Bagration and General Lieutenant Nikolay Raevsky attacked 2150028000 French troops and 55 guns of Marshal LouisNicolas Davout at and near the village of Saltanovka south of Mogilev on 23 July All Russian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses through superior French infantry and artillery firepower French casualties amounted to 1200 men while the Russians lost 2548

Davouts victory prevented the Russian Second Western Army under Bagration from joining the First Western Army of Barclay de Tolly at Vitebsk but could not stop Bagration from effecting the linkup later at Smolensk

Avoiding French envelopment attempts at the beginning of the invasion the Russian Second Western Army under Prince Pyotr Bagration was ordered on 7 July to join via Mogilev the First Western Army of Barclay de Tolly Bagration was threatened with encirclement by French emperor Napoleons forces under King Jerome to the west and Marshal LouisNicolas Davouts I Corps to the north The Russian Prince moved rapidly to cross the Dnieper river at Mogilev to link up with Barclay Davout was faster however and 28000 of his troops took Mogilev on 20 July The Russians arrived before Mogilev on 21 July and their vanguard under Colonel Vasily Sysoev drove out Davouts forward detachments near the village of Dashkovka to the south of Mogilev

Bagration had 45000 men available but assigned only General Nikolay Raevskys 1700020000strong VII Corps to attack Davout Bagrations order was essentially for an aggressive reconnaissance in force Depending on the strength of the French Raevsky would either drive the French out and capture Orsha thereby covering the First Western Armys crossing of the Dnieper or delay them long enough for Bagration to cross south of Mogilev

Weakened by the transferral of his troops elsewhere and fatigue Davout had 2150028000 effectives on hand at Mogilev including 22000 infantry and 6000 cavalry in three infantry division under generals Jean Dominique Compans Joseph Marie Dessaix and Michel Marie Claparde and cavalry under generals tienne de Bordesoule and Valence Davout deployed his forces at Saltanovka a naturally strong position The left flank was covered by the bogs of the Dnieper A stream ran through a ravine across his front with a bridge inside Saltanovka The village itself was surrounded by forests Davout constructed earthworks to strengthen his line fortified the buildings on the main road and set up artillery batteries The bridge at Fatova was destroyed

At 0700 on 23 July VII Corps advance guard of two Jger battalions under Colonel Andre Glebov drove out Davouts outposts on the French left flank By 0800 the bridge on the left was in Russian hands and the Jger continued their advance Davout deployed the 85th Line Regiment for a counterattack backed by artillery The Russian attack failed as crushing French artillery and infantry firepower mowed down the unprotected Russian infantry who died where they stood rather than break for cover

While the Russian attack was faltering Bagration sent Raevsky a new order to storm Mogilev

The 26th Infantry Division under Ivan Paskevich assaulted Fatova in extended column formation forcing I85 to retreat Davout sent a battalion of the 108th Line Regiment and some artillery to help out The two French battalions redeployed on the heights south of Fatova and defeated the Russian attacks Backed by 12 guns Paskevich opened another assault that bashed through the French defenders to take the village Past Fatova Davout had prepared an ambush with four battalions from the 108th Line lying low amidst the wheat fields behind the village The concealed French troops launched a devastating counterattack that caused heavy losses on the Russians and threw them back in disarray Fatova was recaptured by the French Paskevich attacked and captured the village again Davout now moved forward the 61st Line from his reserve All Russian attacks were repulsed and on the right two French battalions overran the NizhniyNovgorod and Orlov regiments crossing the stream Paskevich deployed the Poltava regiment to prevent his right flank from being enveloped

The Russian attacks main point of effort was Saltanovka Raevsky personally led the Smolensk Infantry Regiment to capture a dam and shield the attack of his main force The 6th and 42nd Jger Regiments would act as support along with artillery on both sides of the main road Paskevichs assault on Fatova would take place at the same time Raevsky blundered however not hearing the agreedupon artillery fire that would signal the advance His own attack started too late French artillery inflicted huge losses on Raevskys men Raevsky personally led a charge allegedly with his 11 and 16year old sons Nikolai and Aleksandr although Raevsky denied it but the attempt failed regardless French prisoners informed Raevsky that French reinforcements were on the way Bagration ordered a full retreat to Dashkovka Davout attacked the Russian rearguard later that day but did not achieve a result Tolstoy gives an account of the storming of the dam in War And Peace Book III Chapter 12 when an officer describes the event to a sceptical Count Nikolai

The Second Western Army constructed a bridge south of Mogilev at Novy Bikhov and crossed the Dnieper toward Smolensk The battle prevented Bagration from joining the First Western Army under Barclay de Tolly at Vitebsk forcing Bagration to retreat to Smolensk Saltanovka is generally seen as a French victory but despite failing to link up with Barclay at Vitebsk Bagration accomplished his objective of joining the main Russian force later at Smolensk and avoided Napoleons encirclement

The Russian losses were 2548 men killed and wounded although Marshal Davout officially declared that they lost 1200 dead and 4000 wounded Davout admitted to only 900 casualties which include 100 prisoners from the 108th line regiment and were officially reported by him The Russians claimed French casualties of 4134 killed wounded and missing Actual French losses were about 1200

Cyber Empires
Cyber Empires known as Steel Empire in Europe is a strategytopview fighting game produced by Silicon Knights The game was produced in MSDOS Atari ST and Amiga versions and was originally released in March 1992 The current copyright holder was Strategic Simulations Inc which later became part of Ubisoft

The game has two basic components The first requires the player to engage in Risklike strategic decisionmaking with the goal of conquering the given land mass The player raises cyborg armies to accomplish this goal During the second basic component of the game the topdown battle mode players can choose to assume manual control of one cyborg in their army during offensive or defensive battle sessions or let the computer simulate the battle behind the scenes to much more predictable outcomes This allows players to play only the Riskstyle board game component of the game The opposite battles only is also possible Cyber Empires innovated by mixing strategy with arcade action on a global scale

The game offers a total of nine different cyborgs from which the user can create an army of up to 10 units that is no more 10 units may occupy one country The units range from the small fast mercury capable of little damage but a high speed to the Titan which is the ultimate cyborg capable of long range missile attacks and short range autocannon attacks

The strategy part of the game allows the user to place capitols in any countries occupied by their troops Countries with capitols in them create extra revenue every turn and can be built upon The buildings includes fortifications factories and factory upgrades Fortifications comes in 3 varieties light medium and heavy but can only protect a country if at least one cyborg is present Factories come in 3 varieties also they can have 1 2 or 4 bays The number of bays a factory is determined the number of cyborgs it can build at once The upgrade level of a factory on the other hand determines how fast an individual cyborg can be built

Computer Gaming World warned that Cyber Empires was an action game with strategic elements and that it was not well suited for strategyonly players The magazine called it a solid game It has nothing to rave about and nothing that hobbles it with adequate graphics and sound and recommended the game to action gamers who were fans of BattleTech RoboTech and Giant Robot universes A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game twoplus stars out of five

Dohny Street Synagogue
The Dohny Street Synagogue   Bet haKnesset haGadol shel Budapesht also known as the Great Synagogue or Tabakgasse Synagogue is a historical building in Erzsbetvros the 7th district of Budapest Hungary It is the largest synagogue in Europe seating 3000 people and is a centre of Neolog Judaism

The synagogue was built between 1854 and 1859 in the Moorish Revival style with the decoration based chiefly on Islamic models from North Africa and medieval Spain the Alhambra The synagogues Viennese architect Ludwig Frster believed that no distinctively Jewish architecture could be identified and thus chose architectural forms that have been used by oriental ethnic groups that are related to the Israelite people and in particular the Arabs The interior design is partly by Frigyes Feszl

The Dohny Street Synagogue complex consists of the Great Synagogue the Heroes Temple the graveyard the Memorial and the Jewish Museum which was built on the site on which Theodor Herzls house of birth stood Dohny Street itself a leafy street in the city center carries strong Holocaust connotations as it constituted the border of the Budapest Ghetto

Built in a residential area between 18541859 by the Jewish community of Pest according to the plans of Ludwig Frster the monumental synagogue has a capacity of 2964 seats 1492 for men and 1472 in the womens galleries making it the largest in Europe and one of the largest working synagogues in the world after the Beit Midrash of Ger in Jerusalem the Belz Great Synagogue and Temple Emanuel in New York City The consecration of the synagogue took place on 6 September 1859

The synagogue was bombed by the Hungarian proNazi Arrow Cross Party on 3 February 1939 Used as a base for German Radio and also as a stable during World War II the building suffered some severe damage from aerial raids during the Nazi Occupation but especially during the Siege of Budapest During the Communist era the damaged structure became again a prayer house for the muchdiminished Jewish community Its restoration and renovation started in 1991 financed by the state and by private donations and was completed in 1998 see below

The building is long and wide The style of the Dohny Street Synagogue is Moorish but its design also features a mixture of Byzantine Romantic and Gothic elements Two onion domes sit on the twin octagonal towers at height A rose stainedglass window sits over the main entrance

Similarly to basilicas the building consists of three spacious richly decorated aisles two balconies and unusually an organ Its ark contains various torah scrolls taken from other synagogues destroyed during the Holocaust

The Central Synagogue in Manhattan New York City is a nearexact copy of the Dohny Street Synagogue

The torahark and the internal frescoes made of colored and golden geometric shapes are the works of the famous Hungarian romantic architect Frigyes Feszl A singlespan cast iron supports the nave The seats on the groundfloor are for men while the upper gallery supported by steel ornamented poles has seats for women This synagogue is very different from other synagogues as it is the only one to have pipe organs and a cemetery

Franz Liszt and Camille SaintSans played the original 5000pipe organ built in 1859 A new mechanical organ with 63 voices and four manuals was built in 1996 by the German firm Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden GmbH One of the most important concerts in the Synagogues history was in 2002 by the organ virtuoso Xaver Varnus A crowd of 7200 filled sanctuary seats and standing space some four hours before the concert to hear the artists virtuosity
It was only in the 1990s following the return to democracy in Hungary that renovations could begin The threeyear program of reconstruction was initially funded by a US5 million donation from Hungarian government Jewish Americans Este Lauder and Tony Curtis contributed to the additional 20000000 needed to complete the restoration in 1996

The Hungarian Jewish Museum was constructed on the plot where Theodor Herzls twostory Classicist style house stood adjoining the Dohny synagogue The Jewish Museum was built in 1930 in accordance with the synagogues architectural style and attached in 1931 to the main building It holds the Jewish Religious and Historical Collection a collection of religious relics of the Pest Hevrah Kaddishah Jewish Burial Society ritual objects of Shabbat and the High Holidays and a Holocaust room

The arcade and the Heroes Temple which seats 250 people and is used for religious services on weekdays and during the winter time was added to the Dohny Street Synagogue complex in 1931 The Heroes Temple was designed by Lzlo Vg and Ferenc Farag and serves as a memorial to Hungarian Jews who gave their lives during World War I
In 1944 the Dohny Street Synagogue was part of the Jewish Ghetto for the city Jews and served as shelter for many hundreds Over two thousand of those who died in the ghetto from hunger and cold during the winter 19441945 are buried in the courtyard of the synagogue

It is not customary to have a cemetery next to a synagogue and the establishment of the 3000 m cemetery was only the result of historical circumstances In 1944 as a part of the Eichmannplan 70000 Jews were relocated to the Ghetto of Pest Until 18 January 1945 when the Russians liberated the ghetto around 8000 to 10000 people had died although one part of the deceased were transferred to the Kozma Street Cemetery but 2000 people were buried in the makeshift cemetery In memory of those who had died there is a memorial by the sculptor Imre Varga depicting a weeping willow with the names and tattoo numbers of the dead and disappeared just behind the Synagogue in the Raoul Wallenberg Holocaust Memorial Park

The Raoul Wallenberg Emlkpark memory park in the rear courtyard holds the Memorial of the Hungarian Jewish Martyrs  at least 400000 Hungarian Jews were murdered by the Nazis Made by Imre Varga it resembles a weeping willow whose leaves bear inscriptions with the names of victims There is also a memorial to Wallenberg and other Righteous Among the Nations among them Swiss Viceconsul Carl Lutz Giorgio Perlasca an Italian man who with a strategic escamotage declared himself the Spanish consul releasing documents of protection and current passports to Jews in Budapest without distinction he saved five thousand Mons Angelo Rotta an Italian Prelate Bishop and Apostolic Nuncio of the State of Vatican City in Budapest which issued protective sheets misrepresentations of baptism to save them from forced labor and Vatican passports to Jews without distinction of any kind present in Budapest saving fifteen thousand who saved with his secretary Mons Gennaro Verolino tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II Carlos de LizTexeira Branquinho a Portuguese diplomat serving as Portugals Charg dAffaires in Budapest in 1944 issued protective Passports to hundreds of Jewish families altogether about 1000 lives were saved due to his actions Carlos Sampaio Garrido the Portuguese Ambassador who resisted the Hungarian political police when the police raided his home arresting his guests The Ambassador physically resisted the police and was also arrested but managed to have his guests released by invoking the extraterritorial legal rights of diplomatic legations five of the guests were members of the famous Gabor family

Dohny means tobacco in Hungarian a loan word from Ottoman Turkish  duhn itself borrowed from Arabic dun A similar Turkish loanword for tobacco is used throughout the Balkans eg duhan in Bosnian

Theodor Herzl in his speeches and the Jewish Encyclopedia referred to the Dohny Street Synagogue as the Tabakgasse Synagogue The Dohny Street Synagogue is also known under the name of the TabakShul the Yiddish translation of Dohny Synagogue

On 23 October 2012 an Israeli flag was burned in front of a Budapest synagogue reportedly by members of Jobbik an ultranationalist Hungarian political party

Yang Xingmi
Yang Xingmi  852  December 24 905 n Yang Xingmin  name changed 886 courtesy name Huayuan  formally Prince Wuzhong of Wu  martial and faithful later posthumously honored King Xiaowu of Wu  filial and martial then Emperor Wu of Wu  with the temple name of Taizu  was a military governor Jiedushi of Huainan Circuit  headquartered in modern Yangzhou Jiangsu late in the Chinese Tang Dynasty whose takeover of Huainan and several nearby circuits allowed him and his family to rule over territory that would eventually become the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms state Wu although Yang Xingmi would be the first ruler in his line to receive the title of Prince of Wu it was a Tangbestowed title and did not denote independence of the state including most of modern Jiangsu and Anhui and parts of modern Jiangxi and Hubei

Yang Xingmin was born in 852 during the reign of Emperor Xunzong of Tang He was from Lu Prefecture  in modern Hefei Anhui His ancestors including his father Yang Fu  were farmers for generations In youth Tian Jun and he became close friends and they came to refer to each other as brother It was said that he was physically strong in his youth and during the Qianfu era 874879 of Emperor Xunzongs grandson Emperor Xizong Yang Xingmin became a bandit He was captured but the prefect of Lu Prefecture Zheng Qi was impressed by his appearance and stated to him You will be rich and honored one day Why be a bandit Zheng then released him Yang later became a soldier of the Lu Prefecture militia and he distinguished himself in battles However as a result his commander was apprehensive of him and persuaded thenprefect Lang Youfu  to send Yang on an away mission When Yang subsequently met his commander to bid farewell and the commander wanting to pretend to favor Yang asked Yang what favors Yang would want him to do if any Yang responded I need your head and then killed him Yang then took control of the militia and declared himself the commander Lang was unable to control him and so submitted a report to Gao Pian the military governor Jiedushi of Huainan Circuit which Lu Prefecture belonged to recommending that Gao commission Yang the new prefect to replace Lang himself Gao agreed and Emperor Xizong subsequently at Gaos recommendation issued such a commission

Also in 883 two of Gao Pians officers Yu Gongchu  and Yao Guiili  failed in an assassination attempt against Gaos favored sorcerer L Yongzhi who had in effect taken over Huainans governance due to Gaos trust in him L thus made accusations against them and Gao sent them out to combat agrarian rebels L then secretly informed Yang falsely that Yu and Yaos intent was to attack Lu Prefecture Yang responded by laying an ambush for Yu and Yao killing them and then informing Gao that they had planned a mutiny Gao not knowing that L put this incident into motion rewarded Yang for putting down the mutiny

In 884 when Gaos nephew Gao Yu  then the prefect of nearby Shu Prefecture  in modern Anqing Anhui came under the attack of the local agrarian rebel Chen Ru  Gao Yu sought aid from Yang Yang did not have enough soldiers to respond but sent his officer Li Shenfu who tricked Chen into believing that a large army was arriving from Lu As a result Chen fled Subsequently when Qin Zongquan who was previously the Tang military governor of Fengguo Circuit  headquartered in modern Zhumadian Henan but who had rebelled against Tang by this point sent a brother to attack Lu Yang sent Tian Jun to repel Qins attack Meanwhile when other agrarian rebels Wu Jiong  and Li Ben  attacked Shu Gao Yu abandoned it and was subsequently executed by Gao Pian Yang then sent his officers Tao Ya  and Zhang Xun  to attack Wu and Li after Tao and Zhang subsequently captured and executed Wu and Li Yang commissioned Tao as the prefect of Shu

In 886  by which point the prefects of Huainan appeared to be attacking each other at will to enlarge their spheres of influence  Zhang Ao  the prefect of Shou Prefecture  in modern Luan Anhui sent his officer Wei Qian  to attack Lu Yang sent Tian Li Shenfu and Zhang Xun to resist and they repelled Weis attack Meanwhile though Xu Qing  the prefect of Ch Prefecture  in modern Chuzhou Anhui attacked Shu Tao was unable to resist and fled back to Lu allowing Xu to take Shu Also in 886 under Gaos order for reasons unclear Yang changed his name from Xingmin to Xingmi

In 887 Gao Pians officer Bi Shiduo fearing that L Yongzhi would have him killed rebelled and put Huainans capital Yang Prefecture  under siege L who then had a fallout with Gao himself as Gao wanted to compromise with Bi while L opposed sent Yang Xingmi an order in Gaos name requesting that he come to Yang Prefectures aid Yang under the advice of his strategist Yuan Xi  decided to act He gathered his own forces and requested additional forces from Sun Duan  the prefect of neighboring He Prefecture  in modern Chaohu Anhui and headed for Yang Prefecture Before he got there L with Gao and Gaos nephew Gao Jie  turning against him already fled Yang Prefecture and they rendezvoused at Tianchang  in modern Chuzhou along with Bis onetime ally Zhang Shenjian  who had turned against Bi due to Bis refusal to give him the spoils he wanted By this point Bi who had received aid from Qin Yan the governor of Xuanshe Circuit  headquartered in modern Xuancheng Anhui had offered the military governorship to Qin so he informed Zhang that any division of spoils had to await Qins decision drawing Zhangs anger

Yang Xingmi then took these joint forces and put Yang Prefecture under siege Qin and Bi initially defended the city against the siege but their attempts to counterattack were repelled by Yang Xingmi who inflicted heavy losses on their troops Meanwhile under siege Yang Prefecture was running out of food supplies leaving to severe famine and cannibalism During the siege Qin put Gao to death and Yang Xingmi responded by a great display of mourning After several months Yang Xingmi unable to capture the city considered withdrawing but one night Ls former subordinate Zhang Shenwei  opened the city gates and allowed Yang Xingmis forces in Qin and Bi fled allowing Yang Xingmi to capture the city He claimed the title of acting military governor while putting L and several other officers whose loyalty he considered suspect to death including Zhang Shenjian

However by this point Qin Zongquans general Sun Ru had arrived in the vicinity having been sent earlier in the year by Qin Zongquan to vie for control of Huainan Circuit When Qin Zongquan subsequently tried to recall Sun Sun killed Qin Zongquans brother Qin Zongheng  who was theoretically the commander of the army and refused the recall effectively acting independently from this point on Qin Yan and Bi joined forces with Sun who immediately put up a threatening posture against Yang Xingmi Yuan believed that with Yang Xingmis forces worn out by the lengthy siege and the people of Yang Prefecture facing starvation Yang Xingmi was in no shape to confront Sun He suggested that Yang Xingmi abandon the city Yang Xingmi agreed and he prepared for an evacuation and return to Lu Prefecture but did not carry it out immediately

Meanwhile the Tang imperial government which was also weary of the developments at Huainan Circuit had commissioned Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit  headquartered in modern Kaifeng Henan the military governor of Huainan as well Zhu announced that he was making Yang Xingmi deputy military governor while announcing his own officer Li Fan  as acting military governor He sent his advisor Zhang Yanfan  to Yang Prefecture to convey his good will and decisions to Yang Xingmi Yang Xingmi initially welcomed Zhang but upon hearing that Zhu was sending Li Fan as acting military governor turned angry Zhang in fear fled back to Xuanwu Meanwhile Li Fan on his way south was ambushed by Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit  headquartered in modern Xuzhou Jiangsu who was angry that Zhu not he was given Huainan With both Yang Xingmi and Shi turning against him Zhu abandoned his plans of taking control of Huainan He subsequently recommended to the imperial government that Yang be made acting military governor In spring 888 Sun who by this point had put Qin Yan and Bi to death and taken over their forces finally attacked Yang Prefecture capturing it easily Sun claimed the title of military governor Yang Xingmi fled and per Yuans suggestion returned to Lu Prefecture to prepare his next step

Yang Xingmi however believed that Sun Ru would eventually attack him and in fall 888 he considered heading south to attack Zhong Chuan the military governor of Zhennan Circuit  headquartered in modern Nanchang Jiangxi to try to take over Zhongs territory Yuan Xi however pointed out that Zhong had possessed Zhennan for years and was wellprepared for an attack instead he suggested that Yang attack Zhao Huang the governor of Xuanshe who had been commissioned by Qin Yan when Qin left Xuanshe to head for Huainan Yang agreed and also persuaded Sun Duan and Zhang Xiong an independent general who was then at Shangyuan  in modern Nanjing Jiangsu to attack Zhao as well With Zhaos main forces distracted by Suns and Zhangs attacks Yang was able to cross the Yangtze River easily and put Xuanshes capital Xuan Prefecture  under siege When Zhaos brother Zhao Qianzhi  the prefect of Chi Prefecture  in modern Chizhou Anhui tried to come to aid Zhao Huang Yang sent Tao Ya to face him and Tao defeated him forcing him to flee to Zhennan By 889 With Xuan Prefecture running out of food Zhao Huangs officer Zhou Jinsi  expelled him he tried to flee to Yang Prefecture but Tian Jun captured him After Yang reported what occurred to Emperor Xizongs brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Yang as the governor of Xuanshe Meanwhile Zhu Quanzhong who was an old friend of Zhao Huangs sent emissaries to request that Yang release Zhao to him However Yang accepting Yuans suggestion that doing so might leave Zhao as a threat instead executed Zhao and gave Zhaos head to Zhus emissaries Meanwhile he sent Tian to attack Chang Prefecture  in modern Changzhou Jiangsu then held by Du Leng  a subordinate of Qian Liu Tian surprised Du and captured him taking Chang Prefecture Yang also sent Ma Jingyan  to capture Run Prefecture  in modern Zhenjiang Jiangsu and Ma did so Subsequently Emperor Zhaozong upgraded Xuanshe to a circuit with a military governor renamed it Ningguo and made Yang its military governor Yang then also sent Li You  to capture S Prefecture  in modern Suzhou Jiangsu but subsequently Sun Ru attacked and took Su killing Li You Yangs officer An Renyi  who was then at Run then abandoned Run as well allowing Sun to take Run When Sun attacked Lu Cai Chou  whom Yang had left in defense of Lu also surrendered it to Sun

In spring 891 Sun pressed his attack repeatedly defeating An and Tian pushing toward Xuan Prefecture It was said that the morale of Yangs army fell low in light of the defeats rebounding only somewhat after some successes by Li Shenfu and Tai Meng  Sun pushed forward to Huangchi  in modern Wuhu Anhui and defeated Yangs officers Liu Wei  and Zhu Yanshou a younger brother of Yangs wife Lady Zhu However Suns army was thereafter stricken by a flood forcing him to withdraw and return to Yang Prefecture He nevertheless was able to send his officers Kang Wang  and An Jingsi  to capture He and Ch Prefectures respectively although Li Shenfu soon recaptured them

Subsequently Yang and Zhu Quanzhong entered into an alliance against Sun When Sun heard this he decided that he would destroy Yang first and then attack Zhu He thus forced the mature men and women of Yang Prefecture across the Yangtze to accompany his army while killing the old and the weak As Sun left Yang Prefecture Yang sent Zhang Xun and Li Decheng into Yang Prefecture to take control of the remaining food supplies in the city and to comfort those who escaped Suns massacre effectively allowing him to take the city without a fight Sun subsequently surrounded Yang Xingmi at Guangde  in modern Xuancheng and Yang Xingmi only escaped through the efforts of his officer Li Jian  Sun then advanced toward Xuan Prefecture Yang Xingmi sought aid from Qian who then possessed the Hang Prefecture  in modern Hangzhou Zhejiang region Qian did not launch troops but did aid Yangs army with food

In spring 892 With Suns numerically superior army pressuring him Yang considered abandoning Xuan Prefecture and withdrawing to Tongguan  in modern Tongling Anhui Liu Li Shenfu and Dai Yougui  dissuaded him pointing out that Sun believed that he could destroy Yang quickly and therefore carried a minimal amount of food and if Yang could simply refuse to engage Sun and wear Suns army down he could be destroyed Dai further persuaded Yang to send the Yang Prefecture refugees who had fled to Ningguo back to Yang Prefecture to settle down to try to see if that would cause Suns army to miss Yang Prefecture Meanwhile Zhang and Yangs other officers also retook Chang and Run Prefectures When Shi Pu also wanted to use this opportunity to advance south Zhang and Li Decheng repelled his forces and further took Ch Prefecture  in modern Huaian Jiangsu note different tone from the prefecture in modern Chuzhou

By summer 892 Suns army had been worn down sufficiently that Yangs army was beginning to have successes and Zhang cut off Suns armys food supply routes Further Suns army was suffering from diseases and Sun himself was stricken with malaria With food supplies running low he sent his officers Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin to the nearby countryside to pillage for food Yang after hearing that Sun had fallen ill made a final attack against Sun defeating him Tian captured Sun on the battlefield and Yang executed Sun sending his head to Emperor Zhaozong Most of Suns army surrendered to Yang although Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin took some of the remnants and advanced south They eventually reached the Hunan region and took it over Yang then marched victoriously to Yang Prefecture and made it his headquarters again while stationing Tian at Xuan Prefecture and An Renyi at Run Prefecture Emperor Zhaozong receiving Yangs report made him the military governor of Huainan while making Tian the acting military governor of Ningguo and An the prefect of Run

It was said that due to years of warfare Huainan Circuit was stripped of its population and wealth Yang Xingmi was frugal promoted farming decreased the tax burden and encouraged commerce with nearby circuits It was said that within several years Huainan was restored to what it was before the war began He organized 5000 of Sun Rus soldiers who submitted to him into an elite corp known as the Heiyun Corps  and had them serve as his advance corps in battles against other circuits

Meanwhile although Suns subordinates largely submitted to Yang other than the escaped Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin Cai Chou the prefect of Lu Prefecture who had previously been Yangs subordinate but had surrendered to Sun started a campaign to resist Yang at Lu Prefecture along with Ni Zhang  the prefect of Shu Prefecture Cai in order to show resolve dug open the graves of Yangs ancestors and further had an emissary offer his prefect seal to Zhu Quanzhong seeking aid from Zhu Zhu however despised Cai for his treachery and refused to aid Cai instead he informed Yang of what Cai had done Yang thanked Zhu and sent Li Shenfu to attack Cai and commanded a followup army himself Cais subordinate Zhang Hao surrendered to Yang Lu Prefecture fell in fall 893 and Yang executed Cai  but refused to accept the suggestion that Cais ancestral tombs be dug up stating Because of what Cai Chou did the people under heaven despised him Why should I follow his example Thereafter he also sent Tian Jun to attack She Prefecture  in modern Huangshan Anhui when the people of She offered to surrender if Yang would make Tao Ya who was known for kindness to the people prefect Yang did so and She surrendered Yang treated the imperiallycommissioned prefect Pei Shu with respect and sent him back to the imperial government Meanwhile Ni abandoned Shu and fled and Yang sent Li Shenfu to be its prefect

In spring 894 Wu Tao  the prefect of Huang Prefecture  in modern Wuhan Hubei  which belonged to neighboring Wuchang Circuit  headquartered in modern Wuhan  submitted to Yang When Wuchangs military governor Du Hong subsequently attacked Huang Yang sent Zhu Yanshou to aid Wu Tao starting years of warfare with Wuchang Wu subsequently offered to resign since he feared further attack from Du Yang then had Ju Zhang  take over as prefect Meanwhile the relationship between Yang and Zhu Quanzhong also broke down over two disputes  when an emissary of Zhus insulted Zhang Jian  the prefect of Si Prefecture  in modern Huaian Zhang responded by submitting to Yang and when Yang sent his officer Tang Linghui  to Xuanwus capital Bian Prefecture  with a large supply of tea to try to sell it for profit Zhu had Tang detained and seized all of the tea In spring 895 Yang submitted a petition to Emperor Zhaozong accusing Zhu of crimes requesting that Emperor Zhaozong order the military governors to the north to attack Zhu with him Emperor Zhaozongs court which was extremely weak by that point was not recorded as having taken any actions on Yangs petition Yang subsequently attacked Shou Prefecture and captured it he made Zhu Yanshou its military prefect  Tuanlianshi and Zhu Yanshou was subsequently able to beat back a Xuanwu counterattack and able to hold Shou

Meanwhile Dong Chang the military governor of Yisheng Circuit  headquartered in modern Shaoxing Zhejiang had misjudged his strength and declared himself the emperor of a new state of Luoping  Qian Liu who carried the title of military governor of Zhenhai Circuit  previously headquartered at Run Prefecture but now was headquartered at Qians base Hang Prefecture who had previously been Dongs subordinate used this as the excuse to attack Dong seeking to conquer Dongs Yisheng Circuit Yang not wanting to see Qian conquer Dong tried to dissuade Qian and also sent emissaries to Dong urging him to immediately cancel any use of imperial title and resume offering tributes to Emperor Zhaozong Qian would not relent in his attack however so Yang sent Tai Meng to attack S Prefecture to divert Qians attention while submitting petitions in Dongs defense However while Yang who later went to Su himself to command the siege was able to capture Su additional attacks by Tian and An Renyi against other officers of Qians were repelled and Qians attacks against Dong did not abate By summer 896 Dong was forced to surrender to Qian who executed him and took over Yisheng which was subsequently renamed Zhendong Meanwhile Qian Du Hong and Zhong Chuan all fearing that they would be the next target of Yangs expansion entered into an alliance with Zhu Quanzhong Around this time Emperor Zhaozong also gave Yang the honorary titles of acting Taifu  and Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi  and created him the Prince of Hongnong

By spring 897 Zhu Quanzhong had achieved final victory against two military governors that he had waged war for years  Zhu Xuan the military governor of Tianping Circuit  headquartered in modern Taian Shandong and Zhu Xuans cousin Zhu Jin the military governor of Taining Circuit  headquartered in modern Jining Shandong  capturing and executing Zhu Xuan forcing Zhu Jin to flee and taking control of both circuits allowing him full control of the region between the Yellow River and the Huai River Shi Pus Ganhua Circuit had fallen to him in 893 Zhu Jin fled to Huainan along with the Hedong Circuit  headquartered in modern Taiyuan Shanxi officers Shi Yan  and Li Chengsi  whom Hedongs military governor Li Keyong had previously sent to aid Zhu Xuan and Zhu Jin Yang personally went to Gaoyou  in modern Yangzhou to welcome them It was said that previously the Huainan forces were only capable at water welfare and now with the injection of the field soldiers from Tianping Taining and Hedong their field fighting capabilities were greatly improved Li Keyong subsequently sent emissaries to Yang requesting that Shi and Li Chengsi be returned to him Yang agreed but as Yang treated Shi and Li Chengsi well and awarded them with much treasure neither Shi nor Li Chengsi actually ever returned to Hedong and they served Huainan thereafter

Later in spring 897 Yang resumed his attacks against Wuchang At Dus request for assistance Zhu Quanzhong sent his adoptive son Zhu Yougong  to attack Huang Prefecture Ju Zhang abandoned Huang in response to Zhu Yougongs attack but was subsequently captured by Zhu Yougong Meanwhile Zhu Quanzhong having conquered Tianping and Taining decided to make Huainan his next target so he gathered his available forces and sent his major general Pang Shigu  with 70000 soldiers from Xuanwu and Ganhua Circuits to Qingkou  in modern Huaian posturing to head to Yang Prefecture another major general Ge Congzhou with the forces from Tianping and Taining Circuits to Anfeng  in modern Luan posturing to head to Shou Prefecture and Zhu Quanzhong himself with his main forces to S Prefecture  in modern Suzhou Anhui note different tone from the prefecture in modern Jiangsu The people of Huainan Circuit was greatly shocked and dismayed by Zhus forces However Pang because he had such an impressive force underestimated Yang Xingmis army Yang Xingmi had Zhu Jin serve as his advance commander and Zhu constructed a dam on the Huai River When Yang Xingmi attacked Pang Zhu released the waters to flood Pangs army and then attacked Pang with Yang Pangs army was crushed by the waters and the Huainan forces and Pang was killed Zhu Yanshou also defeated Ges army Hearing that both of his generals had been defeated Zhu Quanzhong also retreated This battle thus affirmed Yangs control of the territory between the Huai and the Yangtze Rivers

In spring 898 Qian Liu Zhong Chuan Du Hong and Wang Shifan the military governor of Pinglu Circuit  headquartered in modern Weifang Shandong all submitted petitions to Emperor Zhaozong requesting that the imperial government declare a general campaign against Yang with Zhu Quanzhong as the campaign commander Emperor Zhaozong refused Meanwhile hearing of Zhu Quanzhongs defeat Zhao Kuangning the military governor of Zhongyi Circuit  headquartered in modern Xiangfan Hubei secretly entered into an alliance with Yang but after Zhu Quanzhong found out and attacked Zhongyi capturing Zhaos brother Zhao Kuanglin  Zhao Kuangning agreed to abandon his alliance with Yang Similarly Cui Hong  the military governor of Fengguo Circuit a vassal of Zhus also had secret communications with Yang and when Zhu discovered this Zhu sent Zhang Cunjing  to attack Cui Cui warded off the attack by sending his brother Cui Xian  to Zhu as a hostage and promised to contribute 2000 soldiers to Zhus campaigns Subsequently when Zhu sent Cui Xian back to Fengguo and demanded that he return with the 2000 promised soldiers Cui Hongs officer Cui Jingsi  assassinated Cui Xian and seized Cui Hong fleeing to Yangs domain with him and the soldiers

In spring 899 Yang Xingmi and Zhu Jin attacked Ganhuas capital Xu Prefecture  Zhu Quanzhong after first sending his officer Zhang Guihou  to try to relieve Xu also personally led a relief force that trailed When Yang heard of Zhus impending arrival he withdrew

In 900 Emperor Zhaozong bestowed on Yang the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong 

In fall 901 rumors arrived at Yangs headquarters that Qian Liu had been assassinated Believing the rumors to be true and believing that this would be his opportunity to seize Qians capital Hang Prefecture he sent Li Shenfu to attack Qians Zhenhai Circuit Qian sent his general Gu Quanwu  to resist but Li Shenfu defeated and captured him However Li soon realized that Qian had not been assassinated and that he would not be able to capture more of Qians territory To ward off a Qian counterattack he who had captured Qians hometown Linan  in modern Hangzhou by this point protected Qians ancestral tombs and allowed Gu whom Qian valued greatly to write home he also pretended a large Huainan reinforcement was on the way After extracting a large amount of monetary award from Qian he then withdrew Yang later returned Gu to Zhenhai in return for Qin Pei  a Huainan officer who was captured when Qian recaptured S Prefecture

By late 901 the powerful palace eunuchs upon learning of a plot between Emperor Zhaozong and the chancellor Cui Yin to slaughter them planned to kill Cui In response Cui summoned Zhu Quanzhong to the imperial capital Changan with an army Upon hearing of Zhus impending arrival the eunuchs led by Han Quanhui seized Emperor Zhaozong and fled to the domain of Hans ally Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit  headquartered in modern Baoji Shaanxi Zhu soon arrived in Changans vicinity and at Cuis urging put Fengxiangs capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege With Fengxiang under siege Emperor Zhaozong issued an edict possibly under the eunuchs duress in spring 902 to Yang commissioning him as the overall commander of the circuits to the east bestowing him the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling  and created him the Prince of Wu The edict ordered Yang to attack Zhu from the east The edict was delivered by Li Yan the son of the retired chancellor Zhang Jun on whom Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the imperial surname of Li Li Yan would subsequently remain in Yangs domain to serve as the Tang emperors representative although after Li Yans arrival Yang also himself began exercising imperial authority as the edict that Li Yan delivered authorized him to do so Yang thereafter prepared a campaign against Zhu

While Yang was preparing the campaign against Zhu Tian Jun who was by this point the military governor of Ningguo was preparing an attack against Feng Hongduo an officer of Zhang Xiongs who had continued to occupy Sheng Prefecture  ie Shangyuan after Zhangs death who had an impressive fleet Because of his fleet Feng had refused to submit to Yang Tian built a fleet himself in preparation and Feng decided to preempt him by attacking Ningguos capital Xuan Prefecture with his fleet despite Yangs sending messengers to urge him not to When Feng engaged Tian however Tian defeated him and crushed his fleet Feng in light of his defeat considered heading east out onto the East China Sea but Yang persuaded him that he would be treated well if he submitted to Yang Feng did so and Yang commissioned him as deputy military governor of Huainan Yang then sent Li Shenfu to serve as the prefect of Sheng

With the Feng threat over Yang launched his attack on Zhus domain leaving Li Chengsi in charge at Huainans headquarters However his army ran into food supply problems as the large ships that he used to ship food supplies got stuck in the canals Xu Wen had suggested supplying the army with small ships instead to no avail but after this incident Yang began to value Xus advice and began to promote him Subsequently when the Huainan army attacked but could not capture S Prefecture quickly Yang withdrew With Yangs campaign having failed by 903 Li Maozhen was forced to kill Han and other eunuchs who followed Han and surrender Emperor Zhaozong to Zhu to sue for peace Zhu subsequently slaughtered the remaining eunuchs and took Emperor Zhaozong back to Changan and kept him under effective control

In fall 902 Qians officers Xu Wan and Xu Zaisi  mutinied against him and tried to take Hang Prefecture for themselves When their initial attempt failed they enticed Tian from coming to their aid When Tian arrived at Hang Prefecture he put it under siege and offered that if Qian would surrender it he would be allowed to withdraw to Zhendong Circuit without further pursuit from Tian Qian refused and under Gus suggestion decided to enlist Yangs aid in stopping Tian who was still Yangs vassal at this point He sent Gu with his son Qian Chuanliao  to Huainan as emissaries Gu pointed out to Yang that if Tian captured Zhenhai his power would increase greatly and would threaten Yangs instead he offered that if Yang would order Tian to withdraw Qian Liu would leave Qian Chuanliao as a hostage Yang accepted the proposal and gave a daughter to Qian Chuanliao in marriage Yang subsequently ordered Tian to withdraw threatening that if he did not Yang would send someone else to take over Ningguo Faced with the threat Tian withdrew after extracting a monetary payment from Qian and forcing Qian to surrender a son Qian Chuanguan as hostage

In spring 903 Yang sent Li Shenfu assisted by Liu You  to attack Du Hongs Wuchang Circuit Meanwhile Wang Shifan who had similarly received an edict from Emperor Zhaozong to attack Zhu during the Fengxiang siege and who had acted on it was now facing the overwhelming attack of Zhus and he sought aid from Yang Yang sent Wang Maozhang to aid him and launched an attack on S Prefecture but soon withdrew his attack from S In addition while Wang Maozhang initially had successes in conjunction with Wang Shifan in repelling the Xuanwu attack soon Wang Maozhang determining that it would be impossible to indefinitely hold off the Xuanwu attack withdrew from Pinglu leaving Wang Shifan without further aid By winter 903 Wang Shifan was forced to resubmit to Zhu

Meanwhile it was said that Tian had become deeply resentful against Yang for forcing him to abandon Zhenhai His resentment was furthered when he went to Yang Prefecture to meet Yang Xingmi to request that Chi and She Prefecture both of which had previously belonged to Ningguo be returned to Ningguo and Yang refused In summer 903 Tian and An Renyi who was then still at Run Prefecture as its military prefect together rose in rebellion against Yang they eventually enticed Zhu Yanshou who was then at Shou Prefecture and who carried the title of military governor of Fengguo to join them as well although Zhu Yanshou did not initially publicly state his intentions and sent emissaries to Zhu Quanzhong who also postured to attack Huainan to aid them In face of the threat Yang recalled Li Shenfu who had been attacking Wuchang to attack Tian and sent Wang Maozhang and Xu Wen to attack An Yang realizing that Zhu Yanshou was about to turn against him pretended to have suffered a stroke and stated to his wife Lady Zhu that he would be entrusting the headquarters to Zhu Yanshou she wrote Zhu Yanshou relaying Yangs remarks Yang then summoned Zhu Yanshou to Yang Prefecture believing Yangs sincerity Zhu Yanshou went and was seized and executed by Yang who then also executed Zhu Yanshous brothers and divorced Lady Zhu

Meanwhile Li Shenfu had initial successes against Tians officers Wang Tan  and Wang Jian  Tian therefore decided to depart Xuan Prefecture and engage Li Shenfu himself At Li Shenfus suggestion Yang then sent Tai Meng to attack Xuan after Tian left Xuan Upon hearing that Tai was about to arrive Tian turned back to Xuan and engaged Tai Tai sent letters in Yangs name to Tians officers who still bore allegiance to Yang and then attacked defeating Tian who then fled back to Xuan Prefecture Tai put Xuan under siege and when Tian tried to counterattack Tai defeated him and killed him Yang remembering his friendship with Tian pardoned Tians mother Lady Yin and continued to honor her as she was a mother Further he incorporated Tians staff into his despite their earlier opposition to him An continued to hold out and would not be defeated and executed until spring 905

With Tian defeated Yang commissioned Li Shenfu as the new military governor of Ningguo but Li Shenfu declined and resumed the campaign against Wuchang Instead Yang commissioned Tai as governor not military governor Yang also sent Gu and Qian Chuanliao along with Qian Chuanliaos wife his daughter back to Qian Liu Meanwhile Zhu Quanzhong had destroyed the city of Changan and forced Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital to Luoyang On the journey to Luoyang Emperor Zhaozong sent one final secret communique to Yang Li Keyong and Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit  headquartered in modern Chengdu Sichuan to ask for them to make an attempt to rescue him none of the three did Still when Zhu Quanzhong sent emissaries to try to persuade Yang to abandon the campaign against Wuchang Yang sent back the response I will do so and rebuild my relationship with you if the Son of Heaven were restored to Changan

In summer 904 Li Shenfu fell ill and died while attacking Wuchang Yang replaced him with Liu Cun  Meanwhile Tai also died and Yang replaced Tai with his oldest son Yang Wo

In winter 904 Zhu Quanzhong himself led an army to try to aid Wuchang and sent other officers to raid Huainan territory He also sent Cao Yanzuo  to Wuchangs capital E Prefecture  to help Du defend it in light of Lius siege However by spring 905 Liu had captured E Prefecture and taken Du and Cao prisoner he sent them to Yang Prefecture where they were executed allowing Yang to incorporate Wuchang into his domain

Through the years Zhao Kuangning remained in communications with both Yang and Wang Jian a situation that eventually drew Zhus anger In summer 905 he launched a major attack against both Zhao Kuangning and his brother Zhao Kuangming the military governor of Jingnan Circuit  headquartered in modern Jingzhou Hubei The Zhao brothers were crushed Zhao Kuangning fled to Huainan and Zhao Kuangming fled to Xichuan Zhu incorporated their domains into his After his success he decided to head east to attack Huainan but after running into storms withdrew

Meanwhile Yang grew ill and faced a succession problem The natural successor would be his son Yang Wo but the Huainan staff members all had low opinions of Yang Wo When Yang Xingmi brought up the matter with his secretary Zhou Yin  and told Zhou to issue an order summoning Yang Wo back from Xuan Prefecture Zhou opposed the idea stating that he viewed Yang Wo as an inappropriate successor due to his love for drinking and games Instead Zhou suggested that Yang entrust the circuit to Liu Wei with the direction that after Yangs younger sons grew older that the circuit be given to one of them  a proposal that Xu Wen and Zhang Hao attacked as unworkable When Yang again told Zhou to summon Yang Wo Zhou drafted such an order but then delayed sending it However Xu and Zhang found the order and sent it and Yang Wo arrived in Yang Prefecture in winter 905 Yang Xingmi commissioned him as the acting military governor of Huainan and soon thereafter died At the Huainan staff members request Li Yan issued an order under Tang imperial authority making Yang Wo the new military governor of Huainan and overall commander of the eastern circuits succeeding Yang Xingmi

ircII runs in a textonly shellbased environment The application has no menus popups or any other GUI features or support for CTCP SOUND that many graphical IRC clients such as XChat typically have

ircII was the first IRC client to implement Clienttoclient protocol CTCP and the Direct ClienttoClient DCC protocol and was the first client to implement file transfer capabilities over IRC The CTCP protocol was implemented by Michael Sandrof in 1990 for version 21 The DCC protocol was implemented by Troy Rollo in 1991 for version 212 but was never intended to be portable to other IRC clients

The RaveUps were founded at Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 1979 by Jimmer Podrasky guitarvocals with Michael Kaniecki guitarvocals George Carter bass violin vocals and TJ Junco drums The original group lasted only through that fall when TJ Junco left the band Richard Slevin drums joined the group in January 1980 and helped the band develop through the year and though the group was considered part of Pittsburghs early punknew wave scene along with its sister group The ShakesCombo Tactic With a somewhat more polished style than many of their peers The RaveUps were considered less an example of the Punk genre and more of a musical stew of punk pop country blues and folk The band performed mostly original songs written by Podrasky and Kaniecki with some songs contributed by Carter and a few covers Early performances in Pittsburgh were at The Electric Banana The Decade Lounge functions at Carnegie Mellon as well as regular gigs at Fat City in Swissvale

During the summer of 1980 the band made 4track and 16track studio recordings including the later popular Class Tramp and In My Gremlin along with the usual live recordings of club dates Slevin left the band in the summer of 1980 to return to his native New York City and was replaced by Victor McPoland a fellow Pittsburgher and CarnegieMellon grad Meanwhile the band left Pittsburgh and relocated briefly to Los Angeles California Appearing as the band in a John Wells later of ER and The West Wing fame production of Sam Shephards The Tooth of Crime the group spent eight weeks in the sun of Los Angeles before returning home to Pittsburgh A later return to LA by the band didnt gel and the original members broke up soon afterward Podrasky returned briefly to Pittsburgh but eventually booked a flight back to Los Angeles in order to further the musical agenda already established by the Pittsburgh group

The second incarnation of the band followed after Podrasky met drummer Tim Jimenez in the San Fernando Valley in 1982 Podrasky and Jimenez quickly became close friends and enlisted a bass player Colleen Campbell to join the band Danny Zippi already established as an actor joined the group soon after and the band gigged around Los Angeles almost always for free Within the year Campbell and Zippi were replaced by guitarist Chuck Wada  bassist Douglas Leonard That lineup signed an indie deal and released a sixsong EP entitled Class Tramp on Fun Stuff Records in 1983 The EP sold all 3000 copies produced But the PodraskyJimenezWadaLeonard lineup didnt last long Late in 1984 Terry Wilson guitar and Tommy Blatnik bass guitar joined the band on a permanent basis Ironically all four members of the band now worked in the mailroomshipping department of AM Records and it was in the basement of the AM lot that the band rehearsed nightly honing their craft amongst stacks of posters album flats and music merchandising In 1985 the band released their first fulllength album Town  Country which was met with widespread critical acclaim and sold more than 40000 copies The albums only single Positively Lost Me became a college radio hit and cemented the band as thoughtful altrockers with an extremely accessible sound smart songs and a considerable fondness for country blues and folk

Actress Molly Ringwald who had become a friend and fan of the band through her sister Beths relationship with Podrasky introduced the band to moviegoers in the John Hughes classic Sixteen Candles when her characters threering binder featured the name The RaveUps scratched on it with a ball point pen Ringwald later invited director John Hughes to see the band at a club date where the band informally and successfully auditioned for an appearance in the movie Pretty in Pink In the movie the RaveUps play their song RaveUp ShutUp on stage while Duckie Jon Cryer talks with Iona Annie Potts at a nearby table just before Andie Ringwald and Blane Andrew McCarthy join them The next song played by the RaveUps in this scene is Positively Lost Me The band also appeared on the MTV Pretty In Pink Movie Premier Special performing Positively Lost Me That song became a cult hit big enough that Rhino Records included the song on Rhinos  During this time the band was getting major acclaim from critics including Robert Christgau Robert Hilburn JD Considine Todd Everett and Roy Trakin and entered into talks with several major record labels

During their stillevolving musical peak the band was locked in legal battles all in the hope of moving on to a major label from 1986 to 1987 little music was released with the exception of a 12inch single These Wishes later covered by Pittsburgh band The Clarks The poignant ballad Big Wide River was the Bside of the single which was produced by Los Lobos Steve Berlin and engineer Mark Linnett The band recorded a fulllength album with Berlin and Linnett producing but the record was never released

In 1987 the band signed to Epic Records and released their major label debut The Book of Your Regrets to high critical expectations despite being only promoted to the college radio scene albeit a burgeoning one The album failed to sell many copies due to Epics corporate restructuring with Sony and lack of promotion The label almost dropped the band but a few believers from Epic insisted that the band get another opportunity That same year their song Class Tramp appeared in the cult horror anthology film From a Whisper to a Scream

1990 saw the release of the album Chance named after Podraskys son with Beth Ringwald to slightly more commercial success The single Respectfully King of Rain became a modest alternative rock hit garnering some video airplay on MTV and peaking at No12 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart The second single a radiofriendly pop anthem called She Says Come Around was readied for distribution including a music video by Epic who then decided that they would not promote the single or video and soon after dropped the band from the label The band continued working for a few months including an appearance on an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 Spring Dance and an opening slot on the Indigo Girls tour Podrasky soon found himself in a brief relationshipengagement with 90210s star Shannon Doherty however Podraskys singlefather status he and Ringwald had splitup many months earlier didnt gel with a Hollywood lifestyle and the relationship soon ended Within months after much frustration The RaveUps unofficially broke up in 1992

In 19961997 Podrasky briefly formed the band The Lovin Miserys with Concrete Blonde drummer Harry Rushakoff and bass player Sam Bowles from Agent Orange but the band never released an album and never toured In 2000 members of The RaveUps Podrasky and Wilson reformed recording a CD entitled The Salmon in the Woods which has remained unreleased as of 2012

Over the years Wilson has played on stage and in studio with many bands including the Springfield Missouri allstar band The Dog People and spending some time with The Ozark Mountain Devils Jimenez continues to play with and produce various bands in Los Angeles Blatnik has also spent time playing with The Dancing Hoods whose guitarist Mark Linkous later formed Sparklehorse and The Lonesome Strangers featuring singersongwriters Randy Weeks  Jeff Rymes

Podrasky and Wilson continued to maintain a musical partnership writing and performing occasionally over the following years In August 2007 with Jimenez and Blatnik back in the rhythm section the band regrouped to play some shows in the Los Angeles area Since then theyve occasionally performed in southern California but have yet to release any brand new material Rumors of a new RaveUps record continue to tease diehard fans of the band

Jimmer Podrasky recorded his first solo album with drummerproducer Mitch Marine guitaristsongwriter Brian Whelan and bassistsongwriter Ted Russell Kamp the album is The WouldBe Plans and was released through JimmerMusiccom in September 2013 According to an interview with MSN Music Podrasky had intended the album to be a RaveUps reunion but couldnt get the other band members on board Though he had the right to release it as a RaveUps record he felt it wouldnt be right so its his first official solo album
Podrasky has since recorded his second solo album and is working on its completion and release

In late 2015 The RaveUps approached Omnivore Recordings about rereleasing the Town  Country album as part of the 30th anniversary of the initial Fun Stuff Records release On July 8 2016 the rerelease became a reality This reissue of Town  Country features the original 10 songs plus a whopping 11 previously unissued bonus tracks  including live radio performances recorded for Dierdre ODonoghues influential SNAP program on Los Angeles legendary KCRWFM as well as 1986 material produced by Steve Berlin Los Lobos and Mark Linett A detailed historical essay from the bands Jimmer Podrasky complemented by numerous unseen photos from the sessionsera make this not only a document of time  place but one that helps document a moment in musical history Mastering and restoration was overseen by Grammy winner Gavin Lurssen

According to Podrasky from the liners Music has the uncanny ability to thwart time and space It informs a moment It indexes lives It creates strange bedfellows It outlasts people  even the people who helped make the music Music resonates more than any other art form  that is its unique power It remains with us long after the last note has faded Town  Country was the beginning of a lifelong journey for me  the start of a trip that still hasnt ended Im proud and honored to have been a part of something that has withstood the test of time

Town  Country is available at Rhapsody iTunes and Amazon

Jimmer Podrasky is a first cousin of the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Roberts

Shengxun
In classical Chinese philology shengxun  voice explanation or yinxun  sound explanation is the practice of explaining a character by using a homophone or nearhomophone The practice is ancient and can be seen in preQin texts Xu Shen author of the monumental Shuowen Jiezi employed shengxun For example when Xu explained the word ghost he wrote

 A ghost is where the state that human beings return to

 to return to gu and ghost gu are nearhomophones A similar explanation of the word can be found in the earlier Erya

The ancient Chinese dictionary Shiming is noted for using shengxun for most of its definitions

Shengxun can be highly fanciful and often results in folk etymology However the practice points to the idea of cognate characters  or what Bernhard Karlgren called word families

St Augustines College Yarraville
St Augustines College was an Australian Roman Catholic secondary college in Yarraville Victoria Also known as Christian Brothers College Yarraville or more simply CBC Yarraville the school for boys opened in 1942 closed in 1972 and was operated by the Congregation of Christian Brothers

The school owes its early beginnings to the opening of St Augustines primary school in 1895 This early school was operated by the Sisters of St Joseph who guided by the charism of Mary Mackillop wished to help the poor of the area At that time the wooden church building served a dual purpose as a school on weekdays for nearly 200 pupils and a place of worship on Sundays In 1896 the school was led by Sister Casimir and the nuns and their assistants taught mixed classes of boys and girls and it was not until much later that classes were strictly segregated

By 1930 around 900 students were being taught in the Parish school and the need to build more classrooms was increasing In 1941 a separate girls school was opened within the parish complex and the need to cater for the boys became obvious

The Christian Brothers arrived in 1942 to take charge of the classes for boys They adopted a modified version of the existing Congregational crest used by the Brothers to identify themselves

In 1946 the school enrolment stood at 240 boys in Grades 5 to 8 also known as Proficiency The following year the school added a First Year Intermediate class to its curriculum The names of some of the early headmasters include Br H Boylan Br E S Crowle 19461952 and Br R McCartney A new residence was opened for the Brothers on Somerville Road in March 1949 but up until that time they travelled daily from the Brothers community at St Josephs North Melbourne by train to the Yarraville railway station

The Christian Brothers college closed in 1972 later to be reopened as an extension of St Augustines Primary school Following the withdrawal of the Brothers the Avoca Street Campus was taken over by the Sisters of St Joseph who proceeded to operate the site as an extension of their Altona West school Mount St Joseph Girls College The handball courts and the ground floor class rooms of the other site were incorporated into the St Augustines Primary School which had continued its operation on an adjoining site while the upstairs classrooms were incorporated into Mount St Josephs campus

Following a review by the Sisters of St Joseph in 1975 it was decided that the campus was superfluous to their needs and this led to the opening of Yarraville Catholic Girls College

The school was particularly recognised in the city of Melbourne for the strength of its sporting teams and the sportsmen it produced For example six members of the 1954 VFL premiership team the Footscray Bulldogs were old boys of St Augustines including Doug Reynolds and Ted Whitten

Bematists or bematistae Ancient Greek  from 
 bema pace were specialists in ancient Greece who were trained to measure distances by counting their steps 

Bematists accompanied Alexander the Great on his campaign in Asia Their measurements of the distances traveled by Alexanders army show a high degree of precision to the point that it had been suggested that they must have used an odometer although there is no direct mentioning of such a device 

The table below lists distances of the routes as measured by two of Alexanders bematists Diognetus and Baeton They were recorded in Plinys Naturalis Historia NH 66162 Another similar set of measurements is given by Strabo 1189 following Eratosthenes

The See All Her Faces album was never released in the US and as a consequence the majority of the tracks recorded in the UK would remain unavailable in the States until the release of the Rhino Entertainment compilations Dusty in London and Love Songs  some thirty years later

In 2002 Mercury RecordsUniversal Music UK released See All Her Faces in its entirety on CD for the first time then also including three bonus tracks two further recordings from the shelved Faithful album with Jeff Barry and also Springfields interpretation of What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life written by Alan  Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand for the 1969 film The Happy Ending Springfield recorded her version of the song during the See All Her Faces sessions in London in the summer of 1970 but it was left unheard in the Philips Records archives until 1994

Hunnemannia
Hunnemannia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the poppy family Papaveraceae containing the single species Hunnemannia fumariifolia tulip poppy or Mexican tulip poppy native to the highlands of Mexico It is typically found at elevations of in the Chihuahuan Desert and south into central Mexico where it favors rocky habitats occurring along roadsides as well

It is a perennial whose erect stems are somewhat woody at the base and may reach in height The leaves resemble those of the closely related Eschscholzia being finely divided into many graygreen linear lobes The flowers are solitary yellow cups formed from four overlapping petals 57cm across vaguely resembling the unrelated tulip the two sepals underneath typically fall away as the flower opens The numerous stamens are short with orange anthers The long thin fruits are also reminiscent of Eschscholzia

The genus is named for English botanist and collector John Hunnemann 17601839 The Latin fumariifolia literally means with leaves like Fumaria fumitory

It is widely cultivated usually as an annual from seed The cultivar Sunlite has gained the Royal Horticultural Societys Award of Garden Merit

He has specialized in teaching and researching Classical architecture especially Baroque architecture and in particular Borromini but also Michelangelo His interest in more contemporary architecture coincided largely with that of his colleague in Rome Bruno Zevi in championing a more organic form of modernism evident in for instance the work of Victor Horta and Frank Lloyd Wright and in Italy with neorealism and the NeoLiberty style This attitude has continued throughout Portoghesis career and is clearly visible in his own architecture It is also evident in his concern for the studies of nature brought to the fore in his more recent book Nature and Architecture 2000

Small unit tactics
Small unit tactics is the application of army military doctrine for the combat deployment of platoons and smaller units in a particular strategic and logistic environment 
The composition of a United States Army squad falls into three broad categories classical balanced and combined

United States Army classical squads are composed of three elements a command and support element a base of fire element and a maneuver element The command and support element could include a squad leader an assistant squad leader a medic a forward observer and a radio operator or it could be limited to a squad leader The fire element consists of a machine gunner and one or two personnel who act as loaders and barrel changers for the gun and porters for its ammunition and ancillary components The maneuver element is composed of troops armed with assault rifles entrenching tools grenades and additional ammunition for the machine gun and tasked with the role of enabling the safe movement of the fire element by scouting ahead and providing a security detail

Balanced squads are composed of two or three fire teams coupled with a command and support element The fire teams could either be standard base of fire elements organized around a machine gun and protected by assault rifle or submachine gun wielding ammunition porters or the fire teams could be organized as storm units composed of a handful of personnel armed with assault rifles reinforced with a squad automatic weapon and grenade launchers

The combined squad is composed of dissimilar fire teams an RPG team a fire team and a sniper team The RPG team consists of two personnel one armed with an RPG launcher and the other porting extra RPGs and providing protection with an assault rifle The fire team is composed of two personnel one carrying a machine gun and the other porting its ammunition The sniper team consists of one or two persons one deploying the weapon often a semiautomatic designated marksman rifle as opposed to a true sniper rifle and the other acting as spotter and providing close protection

The two major techniques of squad assault are bounded fire and advancing under the cover of suppressive fire of supporting units Bounded fire entails having one element of the squad provide covering fire and field obscuration while the second element maneuvers forward to provide covering fire that allows the first element to leapfrog forward This process is repeated until the maneuver element is in grenade range of the enemy positions Advancing under the cover of supporting units requires the squad to stealthily advance towards the enemy position from a weakly held sector after the enemy has been suppressed by overwhelming fire Once the squad has closed with the enemy it uses grenades and squad automatic fire to engage the enemy This allows sufficient disruption of the enemys control of their defensive front to allow other squads to advance unopposed
United States Marines squads are arranged into Buddy Pairs and will assault in Buddy Rushes ensuring that one Marine is firing at the enemy while the other is maneuvering

In this phase the squad consolidates its position by entrenchment construction of fortifications creation of passageways between structures and forward reconnaissance of surrounding areas Minor chemical decontamination will commence as seals respirators and masks are checked for damage Body armor will be examined to replace damaged ceramic plates Casualties will be treated evacuated andor replaced The squad will use this period to familiarise itself with its surroundings dig in to defensible positions recharge itself repair any damage to itself and prepare either for the next offensive movement or go on the defensive against a counterattack

In the defensive an isolated squad will allow a small element to hold a weak easily evacuated position behind a remote detonated mine flanked by a machine gun As the enemy advances the small forward element will pull back When its former position is overrun the mine will be detonated to distract the attackers and then the machine gun will open fire on the attackers flank The machine gun will then switch to engage and suppress the tail of the enemy assault as the rest of the squad manoeuvres against its dislocated and exposed flanks which have been pulled forward from their defensive line to support the head of the assault
In the defensive a squad with a secure means of communication will fix the enemy in interlocked fields of fire and call in fire support from supporting units

William Noel Benson
William Noel Benson FRS FRGS 26 December 1885  20 August 1957 was a research geologist and academic After studying geology at the University of Sydney Benson worked temporarily at the University of Adelaide before returning to Sydney as a demonstrator After winning an 1851 Exhibition Science Scholarship in 1910 he left Sydney to study at the University of Cambridge where he worked until 1913 He returned to Sydney in 1914 as the Macleay Fellow in Geology leaving in 1917 to become Chair of the Geology Department at the University of Otago where for many years he was the only lecturer During his lifetime he published over 100 papers and won several awards including the Clarke Medal and the Lyell Medal He died on 20 August 1957 following his retirement from academia in 1951

Benson was born on 26 December 1885 in Anerley to William Benson a Quaker shipping manager and his wife Emma Elizabeth Benson who was also descended from another branch of the Benson family Soon after his birth the family moved to Tasmania where he studied at The Friends School Hobart between 1897 and 1902 After scientific training at the University of Tasmania he started studying Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Sydney in 1905 where he was taught by Sir Edgeworth David His first paper on the contact aureola of a granitic body was published before he even finished his degree and after graduating in 1907 with First Class Honours he temporarily worked as a Lecturer at the University of Adelaide During this period he published three more papers two on the petrology of PreCambrian and Cambrian rocks in the Barossa Ranges and one on the geomorphology of the Mount Lofty Ranges

In 1909 he returned to the University of Sydney and became a demonstrator in the Geology Department After winning an 1851 Exhibition Science Scholarship in 1910 he left Sydney in 1911 to work at the University of Cambridge where he worked with John Edward Marr Alfred Harker and Thomas George Bonney at the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences In 1913 he was granted the BA Research degree by Cambridge and left spending most of the year travelling Europe with his parents and sisters He returned to the University of Sydney in 1914 to take up the Macleay Fellowship in Geology In 1915 he became a lecturer at the Geology Department and in 1917 he became Chair of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Otago where he stayed until 1951

Despite spending the first nine years at Otago as the only lecturer in the Department of Geology Benson still published several papers most notably a work on the Cenozoic petrographic part of East Otago During his lifetime he published over 100 papers In 1921 he was made President of the geology section of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science and from 1945 to 1947 was President of the Royal Society of New Zealand He was awarded the Lyell Fund and Lyell Medal in 1937 and 1939 respectively by the Geological Society of London the Hector and Hutton medals of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1933 and 1944 the Clarke Medal of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1945 and the Mueller Medal of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science in 1951 In 1949 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1951 an honorary member of the Mineralogical Society of London

<doc id="7706853" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706853" title="Pandara Vanniyan">
Pandara Vanniyan
Pandara Vanniyan    was a Tamil Vanniar who ruled in Vanni Nadu in 18th century AD He is referred to by some as the last Tamil king in Sri Lanka who also rose to revolt against the British Ceylon empire and Dutch Ceylon empire who died battling the British colonial rule on the island He was officially declared a National Hero of Sri Lanka in 1982

Kulasegaram Vairamuthu Pandara Vanniyan was a Vanniar of Vanni Much remains unclear about his family but reports state that he had one sister Nallanachal Vanniyan and two younger brothers called Kayilaya Vanniyan Minister and Periya Meynaar Commander of the State Pandara Vanniyan married Kumarasinghe Maha Vanniyas family of present day Nuwara Wewa who held the office of residential Governor and Custodian of the formerly Tamil area Marriages between Vanniar Chieftain families in the northern and southern regions helped to unite and strengthen rule Thus when Pandara Vanniyan married into the Nuwara Wewa family he gained political power in the south Vanni as well as in the north It is said that he lived in Kumulamunai which is today in Mullaitivu District

Vanniar chieftain Pandara Vanniyan appeared to have paid some tribute to the more powerful rulers in the region at that time who had an independent spirit and a distinct culture and dialect of their own Vanni functioned as a buffer zone between the north and the south of Sri Lanka Historically the Vanni encompassed Mannar Vavuniya Trincomalee Polonnaruwa Batticaloa Ampara and Puttalam hinterlands The name Vanni is said to be derived from the Sanskrit and Tamil word for forest vannam or fire vahni but there is also some historical evidence in KalvettusStone Inscriptions and classical songs that the Vanniar could have originally come from the large Vanniyar clan caste from North Arcot in South India

The beginnings of the people of the Vanni Vanniar who were ruled over by Vanniar Chieftains has not been clearly established but there is evidence of settlements in the region dating back 2000 years Furthermore there is information on the Konesar Kalvettu and in the old Vya song of sixty Vanniar coming from Madurai in South India accompanying the royal bride for the king at Anuradhapura in the first century BC

When the Jaffna Kingdom was captured by the Portuguese in 1621 the Vanni was under their nominal control and it is thought that Parangichetticulam of the Vanni is the former fort of the Portuguese

Around 1782 the continued conflicts came to an end when the Dutch who had by then arrived in Sri Lanka once and for all defeated the Vanniars It has been noted that The Dutch met nowhere a more determined resistance than from one of the native princesses the Vannichi widow Maria Sembatte whom they carried away as prisoner and detained in captivity in the Fort of Colombo

Pandara Vanniyan fought against the British colonial powers The Vanniars commenced to live a wild and marauding life and carried on a predatory warfare against the British in Mannar and Trincomalee and even penetrated to the Jaffna peninsula The British had to build forts along the river to keep them at bay In alliance with the Kandy Kingdom Vanniyan started a revolt to expel the British from his district On 25 August 1803 Vanniyan attacked the Government House in Mullaitheevu and drove out the garrison from Mullaitheevu which was under the command of Captain Edward Mudge of the 19th Regiment before finally seizing the fort

He captured the British cannons and overran the whole of the northern districts Vanni highlighting his boldness and ability to penetrate as far as Elephant Pass and into the Jaffna Peninsula From conventional warfare he resorted to guerrilla tactics but was finally defeated by Lt von Driberg when the recently arrived British organized a threepronged attack from Jaffna Mannar and Trincomalee in 1803 In that battle the British also captured the cannon given to Pandara Vanniyan by Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe The British presented the village of Pandara Kulam to Lt von Driberg as a prize for defeating Pandara Vanniyan

This was followed by the burning of all his houses whereby Pandara Vanniyans people  dispersed into the jungle and eventually out of the Vanni to the districts of Hanwella The power of the Vanniar Chieftains was thus finally and effectually extinguished Alternative histories have it that Lt von Driberg of the Dutch forces felt humiliated by Pandara Vanniyan for having been defeated by him several times including in a personal combat situation despite being permitted by senior officials to withdraw he stayed on even after the British ousted the Dutch

Pandara Vanniyan fell in battle at the hands of Lt von Driberg on 31 October 1803 at Oddusuddan Katsilaimadu A granite stone monument commemorating Vanniyans defeat was erected in the village Katsilaimadu in Vanni it was placed in tribute by Lt von Driberg who had fought him in battle The monument bears the inscription Here abouts Captain von Driberg Defeated Pandara Vawniyan Oct 31 st 1803 In 2010 it was found broken some Tamil media outlets reported that it had been damaged by Sinhalese soldiers in light of recent ethnic tensions and criticized it as an act of destruction of Tamil heritage and culture

Pandara Vanniyan was declared a national hero by the Prime Minister in 1982 and a statue of him was opened with much fanfare in Vavuniya at the main junction on the A9 Highway where the Jaffna and Kandy and Colombo road meets the road to Mannar The Pandara Vanniyan Memorial Day falls on 25 August each year

Presentday Tamils and Sinhalese of North Central and North Western provinces in Sri Lanka which were once part of Vanni revere Pandara Vanniyan highly The Sinhalese are known to summon the protection of Vanni Bandara Deio when they pass through jungles

Tamil nationalists valourise Vanniyan as an epic hero and his character has recently been appropriated and measured against Vellupillai Prabhakaran the leader of the now dismantled LTTE Minister Muthuvel Karunanidhi an Indian politician and writer in his novel Payum Puli Pandara Vanniyan The Leaping Tiger Pandara Vanniyan in English uses Vanniyan to typify Tamil patriotism and transnationalism According to Vijaya Ramaswamy in Historical Dictionary of the Tamils the course of the novel is  connected to  developments in Sri Lanka related to moves by the LTTE The novel describes the mission of a friend of Veerapandiya Kattabomman the last Poligar who resisted British rule in Tamil Nadu to the Wanni jungles in Sri Lanka His mission was to meet Pandara Vanniyan who was also resisting the British This part of the novel echoes the meeting of V Gopalsamy MP popularly known as Vaiko and Vellupillai Prabhakaran leader of the defunct LTTE in the dense jungles of Wanni

Pandara Vanniyan is also the subject of the eponymous play by Mullaimai Ve Cuppiramaiyam Pantara Vanniyan The play was awarded a prize by the Ceylon Art Council in 1964 and was published thereafter in 1970

On 10 August 2014 three statues of former Tamil kings including Pandara Vanniyan Ellalan and Pararaja Sekaran were installed by Jaffna Clock Tower

<doc id="7706856" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706856" title="Criticism of Jesus">
Criticism of Jesus
Jesus of Nazareth is the central figure of Christianity Christians believe that he was and still is divine while Islam considers him to have been a prophet messenger and the Messiah Since the time in which he is said to have lived a number of noted individuals have criticised Jesus some of whom were themselves Christians

Early critics of Jesus and Christianity included Celsus in the second century and Porphyry in the third In the 19th century Friedrich Nietzsche was highly critical of Jesus whose teachings he considered to be antinature in their treatment of topics such as sexuality More contemporary notable critics of Jesus include Ayn Rand Hector Avalos Sita Ram Goel Christopher Hitchens Bertrand Russell and Dayananda Saraswati

The Pharisees and scribes criticized Jesus and his disciples for not observing Mosaic Law They criticized his disciples for not washing their hands before eating The religious leaders engaged in ceremonial cleansing like washing up to the elbow and baptizing the cups and plates before eating food in them  Jesus is also criticized for eating with the publicans  The Pharisees also criticized Jesus disciples for gathering grain on the Sabbath 

The Jewish leaders attempted to stone Jesus for claiming to be God Jesus claim to Godhood is the main reason why Jews do not accept him as the Messiah as the claim is contrary to Jewish monotheism In Judaism not only is there only one God but he is absolutely one without parts or needs of any kind so that a trinity or a mediator is impossible in Jewish theology

In the latter half of the first century and into the second century Jewish and pagan opponents of Christianity argued that the miracles and exorcisms of Jesus and his followers were the result of magic

Avery Robert Dulles held the opinion that Jesus though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery said not a word against slavery as a social institution and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery Giles points to this fact as being used as an argument that Jesus approved of slavery In certain major nonEnglish translations the first statement in the first sermon of Jesus Luke 418 is a call to free the slaves The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the slaves from war see Cornilescu translation

Celsus 2ndcentury Greek philosopher and opponent of Early Christianity mounts a wide criticism against Jesus as the founder of the Christian faith He discounts or disparages Jesus ancestry conception birth childhood ministry death resurrection and continuing influence According to Celsus Jesus ancestors came from a Jewish village His mother was a poor country girl who earned her living by spinning cloth He worked his miracles by sorcery and was a small homely man This Rabbi Jesus kept all Jewish customs including sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem He gathered only a few followers and taught them his worst habits including begging for money These disciples amounting to ten boatmen and a couple of tax collectors were not respectable The reports of his resurrection came from a hysterical female and belief in the resurrection was the result of Jesus sorcery and the crazed thinking of his followers all for the purpose of impressing others and increasing the chance for others to become beggars

According to Celsus Jesus was the inspiration for skulking rebels who deserve persecution

Celsus stated that Jesus was the bastard child of the Roman soldier Panthera or Pantera These charges of illegitimacy are the earliest datable statement of the Jewish charge that Jesus was conceived as the result of adultery see Jesus in the Talmud and that his true father was a Roman soldier named Panthera Panthera was a common name among Roman soldiers of that period The name has some similarity to the Greek adjective parthenos meaning virgin The tomb of a Roman soldier named Tiberius Julius Abdes Pantera found in Bad Kreuznach Germany is taken by some scholars to refer to the Pantera named by Celsus

According to Celsus Jesus had no standing in the Hebrew Bible prophecies and talk of his resurrection was foolishness

The Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry of Tyre c 232c 304 authored the 15 volume treatise Against the Christians proscribed by the Emperors Constantine and Theodosius II of which only fragments now survive and were collected by Adolf von Harnack Selected fragments were published in English translation by J Stevenson in 1957 of which the following is one example

Friedrich Nietzsche a 19thcentury philosopher has many criticisms of Jesus and Christianity even going so far as to style himself as The AntiChrist In Human All Too Human and Twilight of the Idols for example Nietzsche accuses the Churchs and Jesus teachings as being antinatural in their treatment of passions in particularly sexuality There In the Sermon on the Mount it is said for example with particular reference to sexuality If thy eye offend thee pluck it out Fortunately no Christian acts in accordance with this precept the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises Nietzsche does explicitly consider Jesus as a mortal and furthermore as ultimately misguided the antithesis of a true hero whom he posits with his concept of a Dionysian hero Nietzsche was repulsed by Jesus elevation of the lowly Everything pitiful everything suffering from itself everything tormented by base feelings the whole ghettoworld of the soul suddenly on top

However Nietzsche did not demur of Jesus saying he was the only one true Christian He presented a Christ whose own inner life consisted of blessedness in peace in gentleness in the inability for enmity There is much criticism by Nietzsche of the organized institution of Christianity and its class of priests Christs evangelism consisted of the good news that the kingdom of God is within you What are the glad tidings True life eternal life is foundit is not promised it is here it is within you as life lived in love Sin every kind of distancing relationship between God and man is abolished  precisely this is the glad tidings The glad tidings are precisely that there are no more opposites

Dayananda Saraswati a 19thcentury philosopher and the founder of Arya Samaj in his book Satyarth Prakash criticized Christianity and described Jesus as a great thing in a country of uneducated savages
All Christian missionaries say that Jesus was a very calm and peaceloving person But in reality he was a hottempered person destitute of knowledge and who behaved like a wild savage This shows that Jesus was neither the son of God nor had he any miraculous powers He did not possess the power to forgive sins The righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator like Jesus Jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the world Therefore it is evident that the hoax of Christs being the Son of God the knower of the past and the future the forgiver of sin has been set up falsely by his disciples In reality he was a very ordinary ignorant man neither learned nor a yogi

Saraswati asserted that Jesus wasnt an enlightened man either and that if Jesus was a son of God God would have saved him at the time of his death and he wouldnt have suffered from severe mental and physical pain at last moments

Noting that the Bible writes that women held the feet of Jesus and worshiped him he questions
Was it the same body which had been buried Now that body had been buried for three days we should like to know why did it not decompose

In the 1927 essay Why I Am Not a Christian Russell pointed to parts of the gospel where Jesus is saying that his second coming will occur in the lifetime of some of his listeners  He concludes from this that Jesus prediction was incorrect and thus that Jesus was not so wise as some other people have been and He was certainly not superlatively wise

Though Russell believed Jesus had a very high degree of moral goodness he also felt there were some notable flaws in his character In his essay he wrote 

Russell also expresses doubt over the historical existence of Jesus and questions the morality of religion I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion as organized in its churches has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world

Novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand denounced the altruist recipe that Jesus passed down to his pupils and with it the idea of vicarious redemption She thought that not even Christians who think of Jesus in the highest possible terms shouldnt feel outraged by the notion of sacrificing virtue to vice Not surprisingly her understanding of love as a consequence of the rational mind looking after embodied values attributes evil to the ideas Jesus is most famous for Consider the following excerpt from a 1959 interview conducted by Mike Wallace
Wallace Christ every important moral leader in mans history has taught us that we should love one another Why then is this kind of love in your mind immoralbr
Rand It is immoral if it is a love placed above oneself It is more than immoral its impossible Because when you are asked to love everybody indiscriminately That is to love people without any standard To love them regardless of whether they have any value or virtue you are asked to love nobody

Notwithstanding disagreements over the value of faith and the existence of an afterlife Rand saw Jesus insistence on procuring the eternal happiness of individuals as confirmation of the moral confusion and inconsistency in which much of religious ethics operates including Christian altruism

In For the New Intellectual Rand further accuses JudeoChristian tenets such as the doctrine of original sin for their conspicuous immorality The evils for which they damn him man are reason morality creativeness joy  all the cardinal values of his existence It is not his vices that their myth of mans fall is designed to explain and condemn They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man And proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering a death cult No they say they do not preach that man is evil the evil is only that alien object his body No they say they do not wish to kill him they only wish to make him lose his body

Historian and Hindu activist Sita Ram Goel accused Jesus of being the intellectual author behind Western imperialism and the Holocaust
Goel further writes that Jesus is no more than an artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression He does not symbolize spiritual power or moral uprightness

He made his case based on the gospels which he thought cast too dark a shadow on unconverted Jews see for instance  From there he drew parallels between Jesus and Adolf Hitler the latter of whom was in Goels words the first to completely grasp the verdict passed on the Jews by the Jesus of the gospels

Ram Goel also ridiculed what he termed the cult of the disentangled Christ whereby Christian revisionism attempts to salvage the figure of Jesus from the atrocious historical outcomes he inspired  and only from the bad ones  as though missionary proselytism and Western expansionism were to be perceived in the separate as mere coincidence

Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens one of the leading exponents in the New Atheism movement was extremely critical of Jesus Christianity and any religion in general Regarding Jesus teachings on hell Hitchens wrote
The god of Moses would call for other tribes including his favorite one to suffer massacre and plague and even extirpation but when the grave closed over his victims he was essentially finished with them unless he remembered to curse their succeeding progeny Not until the advent of the Prince of Peace do we hear of the ghastly idea of further punishing and torturing the dead

Hitchens also felt that a divine Jesus would be the more morally problematic by virtue of the problem of evil asking
If Jesus could heal a blind person he happened to meet then why not heal blindness

Sam Harris author of The End of Faith has expressed ambivalent views on Jesus teachings He argues that while Jesus may have been an insightful spiritual master of compassion at times he also taught his followers to fulfill the barbaric law of the Old Testament and gave his followers specifics on how to execute heretics To Harris Jesus unresolved frustration and hatred of nonChristians runs contrary to the imagination of contemporary religious moderates and actually lends honesty to more fundamentalist interpretations of salvation and hell He wrote

To the same end of exposing Jesus in relation to the doctrine of hell Harris quotes Lukes version of the parable of the talents which ends with the nobleman character saying

Which is taken to be a selfportrait of Jesus and his own eschatological views

Hector Avalos is perhaps the first openly atheist biblical scholar to write a systematic critique of the ethics of Jesus in his book The Bad Jesus The Ethics of New Testament Ethics Koowon Kim an associate professor in the Old Testament at Reformed Graduate University in South Korea remarks in his review of The Bad Jesus Whether or not one agrees with the authors conclusions this book is the first systematic challenge to New Testament ethics by an atheist scholar firmly grounded in the Hebrew Bible and its ancient Near Eastern context and wellversed in New Testament and Early Christianity

In a review in Bilbilcal Theology Bulletin Sarah Rollens a New Testament scholar at Rhodes College remarks Hector Avalos aims not only to convince us that many portrayals of Jesus based on New Testament texts are morally or ethically problematic but also to demonstrate how scholars have engaged in questionable distortions to minimize explain away or otherwise ignore any textual evidence that might not comport with modern ethical standards

Judaism which includes Orthodox Judaism Haredi Judaism Hasidic Judaism Reform Judaism Conservative Judaism Reconstructionist Judaism Karaite Judaism and Samaritan Judaism entirely rejects the idea of Jesus being a god a person of a Trinity or a mediator to God who has a special relationship with Him that somehow makes Jesus divine Moreover it is Avodah Zarah foreign worship which means idolatry to regard or worship a human being as God in Judaism as well as in Islam God is only One totally transcendent and cannot be human Exodus  Deuteronomy  

Judaism also holds that Jesus couldnt be the Jewish Messiah arguing that he had not fulfilled any of the Messianic prophecies foretold in the Tanakh nor did he embody the personal qualifications of the Messiah foretold by the Prophets According to Jewish tradition there were no more prophets after Malachi who lived centuries before Jesus and delivered his prophecies about 420 BCE Thus Judaism is critical of Jesus own claims and allusions about his alleged messiahship and his identification as the son of God as presented in the New Testament and considers Jesus to be just one of many individuals who claimed to be the Messiah but didnt fulfill any of the Messianic prophecies therefore they were all impostors

The Mishneh Torah one of the most authoritative works of Jewish law written by Moses Maimonides provides the last established consensus view of the Jewish community in Hilkhot Melakhim 111012 that Jesus is a stumbling block who makes the majority of the world err to serve a divinity besides God

Sam Sary
Sam Sary  6 March 1917  c 1962 was a Cambodian politician who participated in the socalled Bangkok Plot against Prince Norodom Sihanouk He was a son of Sam Nhean a prominent politician in the 1940s and father of Sam Rainsy the leader of Cambodias main opposition party He was a close confidant of the then Prince Norodom Sihanouk but had a fallingout with the Prince when he was exposed in corruption selling import licenses and a second time during his tenure as a Cambodian ambassador to London in 1958 for beating his pregnant servant He was alleged to have beaten her so badly that she escaped to the protection of the London police The scandal made headlines in the London tabloids and he was recalled to Cambodia and stripped of all of his duties He disappeared mysteriously in 1962

Sam Sary was Deputy Prime Minister in Prince Norodom Sihanouks government in the 1950s He played an important role in seeking full independence for Cambodia in helping the newly independent Cambodia avoid partition at the Geneva conference 1954 and in helping King Norodom Sihanouk found the Sangkum Reastr Niyum 1955 onwards

He was involved in election fraud and intimidations Keng Vannsak recalled The evil genius behind the repression was Sam Sarya bestial man As an investigating magistrate in the 1940s he had beaten suspects to death with his own hands Then he went study in France In 1955 he joined the Sangkum and became Sihanouks closest aide  After Sihanouk decided to use strongarm tactics Sary handed out money and arms to hire ruffians to come and break our meetings 

In January 1958 Sam Sary was appointed by Norodom Sihanouk as Cambodias ambassador to London thus extricating him from a scandal involving smuggling of large quantities of high grade Cambodian pepper According to Time magazine he brought an entourage of four woman who were his official wife with their five children including Sam Rainsy and three mistresses Six months later Sam Sary was involved in another scandal when one of his female servantsIv Eng Seng who bore him a childwent to the London police accusing him of severely beating her for minor mistakes By other accounts her name was Soeung Son Maly and she used to date Saloth Sar Pol Pot later dumping him for more prosperous Sam Sary Sam Sary was recalled to Phnom Penh but not before he had put his side of the story to the British press He admitted to having beaten his servantsaying 
I corrected her by hitting her with a Cambodian string whip I never hit her on the face always across the back and the thighsa common sort of punishment in my country

He argued his right to do so because 

the embassy is Cambodia in London
After coming back to Cambodia Sam Sary became more and more antiSihanouk Despite the risk of incurring Sihanouks displeasure Sam Sary started a newspaper openly critical of the Princes policies He tried to start his own political party but without success His antiSihanouk activities were dubbed the Sam Sary Affairs

Some commentators contend that Sam Sary worked with US intelligence services which he might have contacted in 1956 while visiting the US On 13 January 1959 in a speech delivered in Kampong Cham Sihanouk told his listeners that he knew about US intelligence plots to overthrow him While this speech had not clearly implicated Sam Sary a week after the speech was delivered he fled to Thailand After a shadowy existence in exile he disappeared in 1963

Hyperion Hlderlin novel
Hyperion is an epistolary novel by German poet Friedrich Hlderlin Originally published in two volumes in 1797 Volume 1 and 1799 Volume 2 respectively the full title is Hyperion or The Hermit in Greece German Hyperion oder Der Eremit in Griechenland Each volume is divided into two books with each second book including an epigraph from Sophocles The work is told in the form of letters from the protagonist Hyperion to his German friend Bellarmin alongside a few letters between Hyperion and his love Diotima in the second volume of the novel and is noted for its philosophical classicism and expressive imagery

Hlderlin began working on Hyperion in 1792 as a 22yearold student at the Tbinger Stift He further developed it while serving as a Hofmeister on the estate of Charlotte von Kalb and put finishing touches to the novel while receiving lectures from Johann Gottlieb Fichte at the University of Jena

Hyperion is set in Greece and deals with invisible forces conflicts beauty and hope It recounts Hyperions attempts to overthrow the Turkish rule in Greece in one of the footnotes Hlderlin specifically ties events in the novel with the Russians bringing a fleet into the Archipelago in 1770 framing the novels events into the Orlov Revolt his disillusionment with the rebellion survival in the deadly Battle of Chesma his devastation when Diotima dies of a broken heart before they can be reunited and his subsequent life as a hermit in the Greek wilderness where he embraces the beauty of nature and overcomes the tragedy of his solitude

The work contains Hyperions Schicksalslied Hyperions Song of Fate an interpolated poem on which Johannes Brahms composed the Schicksalslied Op 54 between 1869 and 1871

Italian composer Luigi Nono includes passages from Hyperion in his work FragmenteStille an Diotima for string quartet as part of the score to be sung silently by the performers while playing the piece

In 1983 the German sculptor Angela Laich created a sculpture named Hyperion after the main character of the Hlderlin novel

Hyperion is included in the 2006 literary reference book 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die

Mart Kenney
Herbert Martin Mart Kenney CM March 7 1910  February 8 2006 was a Canadian jazz musician and bandleader whose big band Mart Kenney and His Western Gentlemen was Canadas premier dance band during the 1930s and 1940s

Kenney was born in Toronto the son of Mildred Agnes Martin and Herbert Kenney Kenney established himself as a leading alto and baritone saxophonist and clarinetist in the 1920s as a member of the CJOR Radio Orchestra and as a sideman to Len Chamberlain at the Hotel Vancouver The Western Gentlemen were first formed in 1931 as a result of an engagement at Vancouvers Alexandra Ballroom for which he recruited trumpeterpianist Glen Griffith trumpeter Jack Hemmings saxophonist Bert Lister and bassist Hec MacCallum who would later be joined by drummer Ed Emel and vocalistsaxophonistpianist Art Hallman Following their CJOR radio debut in 1934 the band embarked on a threeyear run at the Waterton Glacier International Peace Park in Waterton Park Alberta adopting as its theme song the 1922 Billy HillLarry Yoell waltz The West a Nest and You Dear

Kenney and his band gained a foothold in network radio in 1935 with the CRBCCBC program Sweet and Low which in turn led to crosscountry tours and regular appearances at Torontos Royal York Hotel In 1938 the band began recording with RCA and by 1951 it had recorded some 25 78s for RCA Victor and Bluebird Records as well as two for Dominion featuring such hits as The West a Nest and You Dear Theres Honey on the Moon Tonight and the Kenney original Were Proud of Canada

While originally a septet Kenney toyed his bands lineup frequently enlarging it to as many as 30 musicians on some of his recordings See Appendix A Mart Kenneys Musicians in Mart Kenney and his Western Gentlemen for additional details Western Gentlemens guitarist Summer 19371942 Tony Bradan married former Western Gentlemens vocalist 1940late 1943 Judy Richards

Kenneys semiretirement and relocation to Mission British Columbia saw the end of the Western Gentlemen However he continued to organize orchestras for special occasions such as CBC TVs In the Mood in 1971 and a Canadian National Exhibition appearance in 1975 and for engagements throughout the 1980s in the Vancouver area

In Mission Kenney took up the real estate business and ran successfully for municipal councillor while also volunteering extensively with the National Parole Board Corrections Canada the Mission Chamber of Commerce and the BC Lions Society for Crippled Children and served on an advisory council for Mission medium security institution For his efforts on behalf of the community he was honoured with the status of Freeman of the municipality in 1979 and Citizen of the Year in 1981 In 1992 he was honoured with the title of Senior Citizen of the Year in British Columbia and in 1996 was made Missions Ambassadoratlarge During his tenure on council he helped establish a reserve fund with profits from the municipalitys tree farm to support arts and culture in the community
Kenney was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1980 and in 1985 was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Lethbridge In 1995 he reprised his wartime concert performances when he conducted a dance band at the Bay Street Armoury in Victoria BC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War The following year he released a new album Mart Kenney the 78 rpm Years containing twentytwo of the songs previously recorded with his band in times past

Kenney attempted to enter politics in 1968 but lost the Liberal nomination in York North to Barney Danson who went on to serve as a cabinet minister under Pierre Trudeau

Kenney had three children His first wife was Rosetta Matilda Smillie In addition to instrumentalists Kenney also featured numerous singers over the years most notably Norma Locke whom Kenney married in 1952 and who performed with Kenney from 1944 until his retirement in 1969 Norma who died of cancer in 1990 was also instrumental in community affairs having helped create the Mission Heritage Association and being the driving force for the creation of the Fraser River Heritage Park

<doc id="7706961" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7706961" title="Richards controller">
Richards controller
The Richards controller is a method of implementing a finite state machine using simple integrated circuits and combinational logic The method was named after its inventor Charles L Richards One of the distinct advantages of this method over conventional finite state machine design methods is that it allows for easier design of complex finite state machines than the traditional techniques of state diagrams state transition tables and Boolean algebra offer Using Richardss technique it becomes easier to implement finite state machines with hundreds or even thousands of states

The Richards controller was developed because of the need for an easier method of designing finite state machines than using the traditional method of state diagrams state transition tables and logic minimization At the time many of the computer based logic minimization tools that we have today did not exist Hence logic minimization was for the most part limited to the use of Karnaugh maps and DeMorgans law Because of this Charles L Richards invented a method of implementing a finite state machine that did not need an explicit state transition table He published his findings in the February 1973 issue of Electronics His generalized implementation became popular and by the 1980s was considered a classic design method While it is unlikely that commercial products found today contain a classic Richards controller since there are faster designs now than ones that use loadable counters there is a good chance of a modified Richards controller or a design derived from the Richards controller being used

Because of the Richards controllers ability to scale to use many states easily it can be used in many practical applications

The Richards controller is a Mealy machine since its output is dependent on both the current state and the input However Richards designed his own method of representing states using a flowchart diagram instead of the state diagram Each state is represented as a transfer condition on the flowchart Each condition has two control paths leading out of it a YES or a NO The condition is YES or NO TRUE or FALSE based upon a single bit input to the machine Richards p108 Depending on what the input for a condition is one of the two transfer functions associated with that condition will be executed The machine considers executing a function to be setting the output of a single pin on the device this can be used to trigger combinational logic After a transfer function is executed the machine will enter a new state each transfer function will either implicitly or explicitly define a new state to transition to 
An implicit state definition could also be called the default since it will occur without any additional circuitry from the designer if the condition is YES then it will transition to the next state numerically For example if you are at state 0 and a YES occurs then you will transition to state 1 If the condition is NO then the machine will remain at its current state Using this behavior it is possible to create a machine with a simple sequential flowchart
Of course a sequential machine is usually not very useful thankfully there is a way to transition to states out of order using a socalled jump To implement a jump requires additional hardware to select the destination state The exact hardware depends on the function being executed

The Richards controllers core kernel can be boiled down into four parts a counter a multiplexer and two decoders A simple controller can be built using the classic 7400 series of TTL logic integrated circuits The counter used is the 74163 the multiplexer is the 74151 and the two decoders are the 7442 part Richards p108 The output from the counter selects what bit from the multiplexer input should be sent to the output Y the inverse of which is sent to the output WN If Y is high then the counter is allowed to increment otherwise it is not Likewise Y must be high to enable YES function outputs since the D input on the decoder is connected to WN while it must be low to enable the NO function outputs since the D input on that decoder is set to Y To perform a jump you must set the LDN bit on the counter and the A B C and D inputs LDN tells the counter to load the value on the A B C and D inputs Using some combinational logic you can load a value into the counter for certain functions but not others as well as specifying the state address to be loaded given what function is active Doing this is a simple matter of building a table of functions and the states that they should transition to then finding the Boolean Algebra expression for each bit that makes up the address of the state to be jumped to

Area architecture
In architecture an area areaway in North America is an excavated subterranean space around the walls of a building designed to admit light into a basement Also called a lightwell it often provides access to the house for tradesmen and deliveries to vaults under the pavement it stores coal areas

The term is most commonly applied to urban houses of the Georgian period in the UK where it was normal for the service rooms such as the kitchen scullery and laundry to be in the basement Areas were commonly enclosed for safety reasons by wrought iron or cast iron railings which became one of the principal decorative features of the astylar terraced houses of this period Areas are also found in the English and French country housewhere basements were popular in the 18th century as a way of accommodating service functions while allowing all four faces of a symmetrical Classical building to relate directly to its landscape setting as at Mereworth Castle in Kent or The Abbey Skirwith in Cumberland Basements and consequently areas decreased in popularity in the 19th century as attitudes to servants changed although they continued to be constructed as service accommodation in urban settings where land was at a premium until the early 20th century A suburban residential application can be seen at the Gamble House in Pasadena California to light the laundry and service areas of the expansive basement

In early 18thcentury house descriptions the area was usually called the airy which suggests that its primary function was ventilation needed to prevent cooking smells from percolating upstairs to the rooms above This implies that the term area was a corruption of airey rather than vice versa

In North London it was known colloquially as the airey It is a subject of an oldtime childrens ballbouncing rhyme which begins 
One two three alairy br
My ball is down the airey br
Dont forget to give it to Marybr

Tai Po Sports Ground
Tai Po Sports Ground  is a sports ground located in Tai Po New Territories Hong Kong It was opened on 23 September 1992 However the Sport Ground is in maintenance until late October 2017

It is the home stadium of Hong Kong Premier League club Tai Po FC

Tai Po Sports Ground staged its first ever Hong Kong First Division game on 30 September 2006 when Tai Po played South China Despite losing 23 all 2020 tickets for the match were sold out

After the game the stadium was determined to be unsuitable for future First Division games Refurbishment work begun in 2007 to upgrade the facilities including refurbishing the changing rooms building corporate boxes installing new goal posts and replanting the grass such that Tai Po would be allowed play all of their home games during the 200708 season at the stadium The work cost the Leisure and Cultural Services Department HK1 million

On 3 August 2007 the Hong Kong Football Association agreed to allow Tai Po to play 9 games at the Tai Po Sports Ground in the 200708 season regardless whether the games are home or away There were likely to be other first division matches for two other clubs at the ground on the same days as well But after the preseason pitch examination the HKFA decided that it was not up to standard for First Division matches and thus no matches were to be held at the ground

With a potential 13 teams competing in the 200809 season the HKFA determined that Mong Kok Stadiums pitch would not be able to handle the large number of games scheduled there and once again suggested the use of Tai Po Sports Ground for Tai Pos home games The HKFAs schedule for the first half of the 200809 season has shown that Tai Po has been granted the rights to play six of its home games here

On 13 September 2008 Tai Po played its second ever home game at the sports ground against Sheffield United 1136 fans attended the game Tai Po won 21 On 27 December 2008 Tai Po played host to South China and 2520 spectators attended the game setting a new record for the sports ground

The stadium is located near Tai Wo Station a 1015 minute walk away

<doc id="7707147" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7707147" title="Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959">
Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959
The Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959 were agreed between the polluting Chisso company and representative groups of fishermen and Minamata disease patients who had been affected by mercury pollution The agreements and their formation shared a number of common characteristics They were formulated outside the legal system by adhoc mediation committees specially established for the purpose Members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of Chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company

Ever since 1908 when Chisso opened the factory in Minamata wastewater had been dumped into the seas around Minamata particularly into Minamata Bay via the waste canal outlet in Hyakken Harbour Damage to fisheries was inevitable and the Minamata Fishing Cooperative had demanded compensation from the company on two occasions previous to the outbreak of Minamata disease After direct negotiations in 1926 the company agreed to pay sympathy money to the cooperative of JPY1500 USD704 By using the term the company avoided accepting responsibility for the damage and sought to prevent further claims by including a clause in the agreement that the cooperative would never again lodge complaints against Chisso This pattern of denial of responsibility and the inclusion of punitive clauses repeated itself again and again in Chissos dealings with complainants The pollution continued unabated and another agreement was signed in 1943 This time the cooperative was paid JPY152500 in compensation for future and past damage to fishing The cooperative was also forced to acknowledge Chissos importance to the prosperity of Minamata and the need to cooperate so as not to harm its operations indicating the unequal nature of the agreement

By the time of the outbreak of Minamata disease the fishing situation had become critical From 1953 to 1957 the fish catch in Minamata had declined by a staggering 91 In 1956 the Kumamoto prefectural government had attempted to limit the spread of the disease by banning the sale of fish caught from Minamata Bay but did not issue and allout ban This left fishermen with fish they could not sell but no financial assistance to compensate their losses In September 1958 the Minamata Fishing Cooperative petitioned the prefecture to ban fishing completely so that their members might be properly compensated under the Fisheries Law and Food Sanitation Act The government did not respond and only advised the fishermen against consumption of the fish and shellfish they caught from the bay However with no source of income many fishermen were left with no choice but to eat the suspect fish they caught In fact throughout the history of the Minamata disease problem the catching of fish from Minamata Bay has never been legally prohibited

Despite the ban on the sale of contaminated fish there was still widespread suspicion amongst local people that fish caught in the Minamata area was unsafe and by June 1959 several fish shops had gone out of business from plummeting demand Desperate and with no assistance from government the cooperative was forced into direct negotiations with the company On 6 August 400 members of the cooperative marched on the factory and in a hostile atmosphere met with factory manager Eiichi Nishida The fishermens demand for the cleanup of Minamata Bay the installation of wastewater treatment facilities and JPY100 million USD278000 was met with an offer of emergency sympathy money to the value of JPY500000 USD1390 and a promise to consult with the companys head office in Tokyo

Fishermen from the cooperative again forced their way into the factory on 12 August to continue negotiations No agreement could be reached but the two sides did manage to agree to a joint inspection of fishing conditions in Minamata Bay followed by further talks on 17 August After this inspection Chisso admitted that fishing was impossible in some areas and made a final offer of JPY13 million USD36100 This paltry sum incensed the fishermen Violence broke out riot police were called and Nishida and other company employees were effectively held hostage in the factory building Only after Mayor Todomu Nakamura agreed to mediate between the two sides did the fishermen leave the factory grounds The mediation committee formed by Mayor Nakamura was stacked heavily in Chissos favour and presented a decision on 26 August The company would pay JPY20 million USD55600 directly to the cooperative and set up a JPY15 million USD41700 fund to promote the recovery of fishing The proposal was qualified with the ultimatum that if either side rejected the committee would stop mediation completely On 29 August the fishing cooperative delivered its response In order to end the anxiety of the citizens we swallow our tears and accept The company also agreed and the first compensation agreement between Chisso and fisherman was complete

To the companys disappointment this first agreement did not bring an end to problems with fishermen Since Chisso had switched the wastewater output from Minamata Bay to the mouth of Minamata River in September 1958 the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the Shiranui Sea Cats had started to die in Ashikita to the north and in Izumi to the south of Minamata and new Minamata disease patients were also appearing The pollution was having a widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as peoples confidence in the safety of their food evaporated This drove the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives to take action of a similar pattern to that taken by the Minamata Fishing Alliance earlier in the year but on a larger scale On 17 October 1500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with Chisso When company officials refused the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office breaking windows and injuring seven guards Alliance president Ushita Murakami delivered their demands to company manager Nishida who promised a prompt reply When the response came the company said that since the factorys waste had still not been proven as the cause of Minamata disease and it could offer the fishermen nothing

Unsatisfied Murakami and followers travelled to Tokyo and met with officials of numerous government departments to outline their plight He managed to secure a promise from members of the Diet that they would visit Minamata to investigate the situation When the Diet party arrived in Minamata on 2 November they were met by a crowd of 4000 demonstrators including fishermen and disease victims groups alike outside the Municipal Hospital The crowd was extremely respectful to the Diet members and pleaded with them for help The members thanked the demonstrators for bringing the issue to the attention of the national government and promised they would do all they could

Emboldened after their demonstration at the hospital the alliance fishermen marched on the factory to again demand negotiations The company refused and the fishermen forced their way in and rioted attacking many buildings and significantly damaging company property Riot police arrived and serious fighting continued sporadically for the rest of the day until the fishermen dispersed around 9 pm Injuries included 3040 fishermen two company employees factory manager Nishida himself 64 policemen and the chief of police Damages to company property amounted to JPY10 million USD27800 Before the riot the Minamata disease issue had been skirted by the national media and had been chiefly a local issue The violent riot however was covered widely in the national media and for the first time since the discovery of the disease in 1956 the issue of Minamata disease had nationwide coverage

A mediation committee headed by Kumamoto Prefecture Governor Hirosaku Teramoto was formed to hammer out a solution At a meeting on 2 December the prefectural fishing alliance outlined their demands compensation of JPY25 billion USD69 million for damage to fishing since 1953 the temporary closure of the factory and removal of toxic sludge The committee then met company executives including Chisso president Kiichi Yoshioka who responded with an offer that amounted to nearly zero After weeks of wrangling the fishing alliance reduced its demands to JPY980 million USD27 million and Chisso under increasing pressure from all sides relaxed its position The proposed agreement presented with the ultimatum of no further mediation from the committee should it be rejected as previously called for the immediate installation of wastewater treatment facilities JPY35 million compensation to be paid to the alliance JPY10 million of which would be deducted to cover the damage caused in the 2 November riots and a JPY65 million fund for the recovery of the fishing industry The agreement also included a clause that the alliance could never demand further compensation even if the factorys waste was proven to be the cause of the damage The agreement was accepted by both sides on 17 December

In 1959 the victims of Minamata disease and their families were in a much weaker position than the fisherman who had extracted at least some sympathy money from Chisso The only patients organisation present at the time of the fishermens agreements was the Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society which had only been established in August 1957 They were much fewer in number in November 1959 the society only represented the 58 families of 78 patients and the membership of the society was more divided than the relatively united fishermen One factor driving the division of the patients was the discrimination and ostracism some families were experiencing in the Minamata community Local people who were naturally averse to uncleanliness and disease felt that the company and their city that depended upon it was facing economic ruin under the pressure of the various groups making demands of it Even fishermen who were fellow victims of the companys pollution discriminated against disease victims because they were stoking fears that prevented the sale of their fish To some patients this ostracisim from the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself

In a similar fashion to the fishermens associations the Mutual Aid Society began by petitioning the city and prefectural governments and visited Kumamoto city on 21 November When their petitions produced no results the society approached Chisso directly and demanded compensation of JPY234 million USD650000  JPY3 million USD8300 per person On 28 November the company replied that the link between the factorys wastewater and Minamata disease had not been proven and could therefore offer them nothing but an expression of sympathy The society began a sitin at the company gates which was to last a whole month

Around 50 members of the society travelled to Kumamoto on 1 December and made a request to Governor Teramoto to include the patients request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance He agreed to consult with the company and when the mediation committee presented its deal to the fishing alliance on 16 December it also presented a proposal for sympathy payments to the Mutual Aid Society even though no representatives had been present on the mediation committee The proposal amounted to a total compensation package of JPY74 million The money would be allocated to patients certified by a committee to be established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare as follows adult patients would receive JPY100000 USD278 and children JPY10000 USD28 per year families of dead patients would receive a JPY320000 USD889 payment Society leader Eiz Watanabe agreed that the overall level of compensation was acceptable but rejected the plan over the staggered schedule of payments and the very small sum being offered for child victims

The mediation committee reconvened on 25 December and agreed to increase the child payments to JPY30000 USD83 per child The Mutual Aid Society held a vote of its members but the agreement was rejected by a single vote Society leader Watanabe offered his resignation in protest but when another vote was held on 27 December members accepted the agreement and his resignation was withdrawn As usual the agreement did not admit responsibility for Minamata disease The payments were sympathy money and the agreement included a clause that Even if in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is the factorys wastewater the patients will make absolutely no further demands for compensation along with an extra clause that If in the future it is determined that the cause of Minamata disease is not the factorys wastewater the company shall end payments at the end of that month The final agreement was accepted by both sides on 29 December 1959

Roy Lee
Roy Lee born March 23 1969 is an American film producer Vertigo Entertainment Lees production company in Beverly Hills California has a firstlook deal with Warner Bros

Lee was born in 1969 at Wyckoff Heights Hospital in Brooklyn New York to Korean parents His father a doctor and his mother had been in America for just three years and were still acclimating Lees mother a devout Christian nurtured hopes that he would become a minister

Lee graduated Walter Johnson High School in 1987 During his undergraduate studies at George Washington University Lee interned at the law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver  Jacobson After graduating GWU Lee attended law school at American University Washington College of Law where he prepared for a career in corporate law

In 1996 after graduating law school at American University and working at Fried Frank for eight months he moved to Los Angeles and worked as a tracker at a production company called Alphaville Trackers monitor spec material and dealmaking At the time trackers shared information over the phone constantly updating each other in an endless cycle of calls

One of Lees tracker friends Polly Cohen Johnsen had been updating the story department at Jersey Films and had the idea to put their tracking group online Lee joined forces with Johnsen and Glenn Gregory of Propaganda Films to convert their daily phone calls into an online tracking group In 1997 Lee set up an Internet bulletin board called Tracker for twenty of his friends who rated scripts and posted pertinent tracker information for each

Within six months Lee had established twentyfive online groups for other trackers at production companies and studios in Hollywood Since he was the only member who belonged to every group he had the best information Lees project changed the spec script market forever While spec scripts and pitches continued to sell weaker material was dismissed more quickly often within a single day to the frustration of many agents Online tracking accelerated the market brought more honesty allowed development execs to sift for material more effectively and put more pressure on agents and producers to represent better material

In 1999 Lee went to work with BenderSpink a talentmanagement company owned by two of his friends Chris Bender and JC Spink He was charged with finding Internet content short films that would play on personal computers In this same year Ed Kashiba and Lee developed the company Scriptsharkcom an online method for novice screenwriters to have their scripts assessed and potentially They later added partner Sean Connolly and eventually sold the site to iFilm in 2001 iFilm later sold Scriptsharkcom to The New York Times Scriptshark only closed in 2016

In the fall of 2001 after setting up film projects at all the major studios Lee left BenderSpink and joined Doug Davison to create Vertigo Entertainment When working on a project together Lee did the selling and Davison handled the followup work Lee noted that in the beginning the hardest thing was making contacts abroad

Lees approach to making deals involved explaining to Asian distributors that their films would probably not sell in America because of their subtitles and that they would make more money by selling remake rights Then he assured the rights holder that he would protect them by representing them for free the American studio would pay his fee when the film was made Once Lee had secured the right to negotiate for an Asian company he told the studios to regard the film as a script that someone had taken the trouble to film and that had been tested and proved a hit in its home country

Lee earned his first motion picture producing credit on Gore Verbinskis 2002 blockbuster The Ring He went on to produce the 2004 haunted house horror film The Grudge which starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and was based on the 2002 Japanese film  which was directed by Takashi Shimizu The box office hit held the record for biggest horror opening weekend following its October 2004 release

The Grudge 2 was released in October 2006 starring Amber Tamblyn and Gellar and directed by Shimizu It topped the box office at 22 million on its opening weekend Also in October 2006 The Departed a crime thriller from Warner Bros directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson was released grossing 27 million in its opening weekend It was Scorseses biggest opening ever The Departed later went on to win Best Picture at the 79th Academy Awards

Trap plumbing
In plumbing a trap is a device shaped with a bending pipe path to retain fluid to prevent sewer gases from entering buildings while allowing waste materials to pass through In oil refineries traps are used to prevent hydrocarbons and other dangerous gases and chemical fumes from escaping through drains

In domestic applications traps are typically U S Q or Jshaped pipe located below or within a plumbing fixture An Sshaped trap is also known as an Sbend It was invented by Alexander Cummings in 1775 but became known as the Ubend following the introduction of the Ushaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880 The Ubend could not jam so unlike the Sbend it did not need an overflow The most common of these traps is referred to as a Ptrap It is the addition of a 90 degree fitting on the outlet side of a Ubend thereby creating a Plike shape oriented horizontally It is also referred to as a sink trap because it is installed under most sinks

Because of its shape the trap retains some water after the fixtures use This water creates an air seal that prevents sewer gas from passing from the drain pipes back into the building Essentially all plumbing fixtures including sinks bathtubs and showers must be equipped with either an internal or external trap Toilets almost always have an internal trap

Because it is a localized lowpoint in the plumbing sink traps also tend to capture dense objects such as jewelry or coins inadvertently dropped down the sink Traps also tend to collect hair sand food waste and other debris and limit the size of objects that enter the plumbing system thereby catching oversized objects For all of these reasons most traps may be disassembled for cleaning or provide a cleanout feature

Where a volume of water may be rapidly discharged through the trap a standpipe may be required to minimize impact to other nearby traps

An Sshaped trap is also known as an Sbend It was invented by Alexander Cumming in 1775 but became known as the Ubend following the introduction of the Ushaped trap by Thomas Crapper in 1880 The new Ubend could not jam so unlike the Sbend it did not need an overflow

Once invented despite being simple and reasonably reliable widespread use was slow coming In Britain the requirement to use traps was introduced only after the Great Stink in London in the summer of 1858 when the objectionable smell of the River Thames which was effectively an open sewer affected the nearby Houses of Parliament That motivated the legislators to authorise the construction of a modern sewerage system in the city of which the Sbend was an essential component  only about twothirds of the world population have access to traps in spite of the evidence that good sewage systems significantly improve economic productivity in places that employ them

Maintaining the water seal is critical to trap operation traps might dry out and poor venting can suction or blow water out of the traps This is usually avoided by venting the drain pipes downstream of the trap by being vented to the atmosphere outside the building the drain lines never operate at a pressure much higher or lower than atmospheric pressure Plumbing codes usually provide strict limitations on how far a trap may be located from the nearest vent stack

When a vent cannot be provided codes may allow the use of an air admittance valve instead These devices avoid negative pressure in the drain pipe by venting room air into the drain pipe behind the trap A Chicago Loop is another alternative

When a trap is installed on a fixture that is not routinely usedsuch as a floor drainthe eventual evaporation of the water in the trap must be considered In these cases a trap primer may be installed these are devices that automatically recharge traps with water to maintain their water seals

In some regions of the United States S traps are no longer accepted by the plumbing codes as these traps tend to siphon dry even when well vented It may be possible to determine whether a household uses an S or Ubend by the presence of an overflow pipe outlet What is required instead is a Ptrap with proper venting Certain drumstyled traps are also discouraged or banned

The Bosatlas is a Dutch atlas Used in most schools it remains the best selling atlas in the Netherlands

The atlas was started by  a Groningen teacher The first atlas was published in 1877 with the name Bos Schoolatlas der geheele aarde Boss School Atlas of the Whole Earth Later editions were named Bosatlas Bos continued to look after the production of the atlas until his death in 1902 his final production was the 15th edition The last of his successors to take individual responsibility for the Atlas was FJOrmeling 19761981 Since 1981 responsibility for the atlas has been collectively attributed and it is the publishers name that has been highlighted in the atlas and associated marketing material

The reason for first publication was the introduction of geography in former Dutch high schools The maps were originally drawn by hand The publisher was Jan Berend Wolters of Groningen whose firm continues to publish the atlas as

Action assembly theory
Action assembly theory AAT is a communication theory that emphasizes psychological and social influences on human action The goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior  how an individuals thoughts get transformed into action It was developed by John Greene

Action assembly theory describes the production of behavior in two essential processes 

The idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly These records contain information about action outcomes and situations These records are locked in the individuals memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future

A procedural record is at the center of action assembly It is a personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use part of an individuals memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored Procedural records contain information about action outcomes and situations for example traveling at excessive speed action in a zone that specifies low speed limit situationcan result in the issuance of a ticket outcome

Procedural records have different levels of strength Some are mere scratches that barely leave a trace in the mind while others are wellworn into longterm memory

A central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations The activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records For example if a parent disciplined a child for stealing all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated In turn if a common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items a procedural record of that would be activated quickly

It is also important to consider the process of assembly which organizes records into a behavioral representation For example assembly is considered a topdown process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message

Action assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking These concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing Another use is the study of planning  individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production

When an interaction situation has multiple goals the theory finds increased demands on an individuals information processing capacity Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goals may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals In turn multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies The utilization of Action Assembly theory can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to mitigate the effect

When an interaction situation has multiple goals the theory finds increased demands on an individuals information processing capacity Assembly of goals may be difficult because a specific goal may be incompatible with behaviors associated with each other goals In turn multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitation The utilization of AAT can provide a clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to ease the effect

Perduellio
In the early days of Ancient Rome perduellio  was the term for the capital offense of high treason It was set down plainly in the Law of the Twelve Tables as follows
The Law of the Twelve Tables orders that he who has stirred up an enemy or who has handed over a citizen to the enemy is to be punished capitally Marcianus D 48 4 3 

Under the terms of this law those convicted of perduellio were subject to death either by being hanged from the arbor infelix a tree deemed to be unfortunate or by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock Their families were not allowed to mourn them and their houses were razed

As the concept of national sovereignty took hold in Rome perduellio also came to mean an offense which injured or brought into danger the dignity supremacy and power of the commonwealth Roman State This included such things as losing an army violating the rights of the tribunes of the plebs or usurping a function of the State as in the case of Horatius

In the Ab Urbe Condita Livy recorded the first instance of both a trial of perduellio and appeal

It enraged the fiery youth to hear his sisters lamentations in the hour of his own victory and the nations great rejoicing And so drawing his sword and at the same time angrily upbraiding her he ran her through the bodyThe kingsaid In accordance with the law I appoint duumvirs to pass judgment upon Horatius for treason perduellio The dread formula or the law ran thus Let the duumvirs pronounce him guilty of treason if he shall appeal from the duumvirs let the appeal be tried if the duumvirs win let the lictor veil his head let the lictor suspend him with a rope from a barren tree arbor infelix let the lictor scourge him either within or without the pomerium Even though the duumvirs found Horatius guilty Horatius was allowed to appeal to the people and by them was acquitted However Horatius father had to perform expiatory rites and Horatius himself was forced to pass under the yoke 

But over time with the expansion of the rights of Roman citizens the use of corporal punishment lessened until the time of Augustus when conviction only carried with it the punishment of aquae et ignis interdictio exile

The trial was conducted by the duumviri perduellionis who during the Monarchy were appointed by the king Later on during the Republic they were proposed by the consuls and formally appointed by the comitia comitia curiata or comitia centuriata The judgement of the duumviri was subject to appeal which generally was tried by the comitia centuriata unlike in Horatius trial The prosecution was led by tribunes or aediles

By the late Republic the archaic perduellio had become largely obsolete though it could still be used see Gaius Rabirius Its offenses were covered by the law of maiestas which included a broader range of crimes Perduellio became the designation for a particularly odious type of maiestas

The station was on the former line between and  which closed in 1930 On 4 October 1976 a new unstaffed passenger station was opened by British Rail to serve the nearby RollsRoyce factory Despite Derby City Councils efforts to encourage usage of public transport based on the CrossCity Line in Birmingham the service was very underused

The service was reduced to one return train per day in 1992 with the return departing Sinfin Central at 0657 The service did not run at weekends and there was no evening return This ran until 1993 when the Derwent Valley Line which interworked with the Sinfin branch changed to using Sprinter trains Sprinters were not permitted on the branch because of compatibility issues with the obsolete lowvoltage track circuits used on the line The last train on 17 May 1993and the train service was replaced with a taxi

On 2 May 1997 the line became part of the Central Trains franchise as part of the privatisation of British Rail but none of their trains ever stopped at the station On 6 November 1997 Central Trains and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising proposed the closure of the line It was granted on 21 May 1998 by Rail Regulator John Swift QC During the final year there were three regular users of the taxi at a single fare of 120

Unlike Sinfin North Sinfin Central had public access with a long footpath from Wilmore Road There was no public road access to the station or car park and the path is still in situ

The line survives to serve the RollsRoyce plant and the station is still in situ

Radomir Putnik
Field Marshal Radomir Putnik   24 January 1847  17 May 1917 was the first Serbian Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff of the Serbian army in the Balkan Wars and in the First World War He took part in all of the wars in which Serbia took part between 1876 to 1917

The Putnik family was originally from Kosovo but fled the region to the Habsburg Monarchy during the Great Serb Migration of 1690 The family decided to return from exile to the Principality of Serbia the first modern Serbian polity independent of Ottoman rule in the mid19th century Putniks father Dimitrije was a teacher in Kragujevac and Radomir completed his basic schooling there He attended the Artillery School the precursor to what would eventually become the Military Academy in Belgrade where he graduated in 1863 placing eighth in his class In 1879 he married Ljubica Bojovi the sister of  who later became Minister of Military Affairs and daughter of Colonel Todor Bojevi and Jelena Tadi with whom he had seven children three daughters and four sons Contemporaries describe Putnik as an ascetic introverted man and a heavy smoker however he also had decided views on professional issues He proved himself on the battlefield during Serbias wars against the Ottomans fought between 1876 and 1877 It was a military force under his command that took Gnjilane and Graanica from the Ottomans in Kosovo during the closing stages of the second SerboOttoman War 18771878 The Serbian troops under Major Putnik were obliged to pull back to Merdare in order to meet a stipulation in the general armistice between Russian and the Ottomans Putnik was noted for being a selfrighteous and demanding officer prone to strongly defending his point of view

Putnik became a professor in the Military Academy holding that position from 1886 to 1895 In 1889 he was appointed as the Deputy Chief of the General Staff However he soon came into conflict with King Milan I partly for not allowing a protg of the king to pass an examination Political intrigue and latent conflict with King Milan Obrenovi and his successor King Alexander I would hinder his advancement throughout this part of his career In 1895 he was forced to retire by the king under suspicion of sympathy for the Radical party of Nikola Pai

Putnik was rehabilitated following the coup detat against Alexander I Obrenovi in 1903 Under the new king of Serbia Peter I Karadjordjevi he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed as the Chief of the General Staff He then proceeded to completely reorganize the Serbian army by retiring old and promoting new officers and updating outdated war plans Putnik was Serbian Minister of War three times 1904 19061908 1912 Putnik appointed General ivojin Mii as his deputy Despite occasional personality clashes the two men had deep respect for each other Putnik was the first officer to be appointed to the highest rank of Field Marshal In 1912 he led the Serbian Army into spectacular victories in the First Balkan War against the Ottomans Battle of Kumanovo October 1912 Battle of Monastir November 1912 and the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria Battle of Bregalnica 1913 FieldMarshal Putnik expecting Bulgarian attack had deployed his troops on the most important strategic points near the river Bregalnica Bregalnitza which was essential for a quick victory after the sudden unannounced Bulgarian attack

Caught in Budapest when AustriaHungary declared war upon his country Field Marshal Putnik was allowed safe passage back to Serbia in a chivalrous and possibly selfdefeating gesture by the AustroHungarian emperor Franz Josef After a troublesome trip Putnik returned to Serbia and offered his resignation to King Peter I of Serbia on the grounds of age and ill health It was rejected the king insisting that Field Marshal Putnik take command over the army if only in a strategic sense while younger generals such as Stepa Stepanovi ivojin Mii and Petar Bojovi would take over operational duties Putnik had to spend most of his time in a wellheated room However his impaired health did not prevent him from successfully organizing the campaign Serbia defeated the AustroHungarian Armys offensives in August and September 1914 battles of Cer and Kolubara driving it out of Serbia by December 1914

The Serbian front then remained relatively quiet until autumn 1915 when joint AustroHungarian German and Bulgarian forces led by German Field Marshal August von Mackensen began a large offensive against Serbia with more than 300000 soldiers Before the joint attack Putnik warned the Serbian government that Bulgaria was concentrating her troops at the eastern Serbian borders and that a preventive attack on Bulgaria was the only chance for Serbia to avoid fighting on two fronts His demand was rejected due to the wishes of the Allies who were still hoping to isolate Bulgaria from joining the Triple Alliance Despite heroic resistance the Serbian troops were obliged to retreat towards Kosovo On 31 October Putnik ordered a general retreat onto Kragujevac attempting to keep his exhausted army together as it sought to escape into friendly territory Many of Putniks soldiers were farmers who occasionally slipped away from the retiring army to resume their rural lives Putniks rapidly declining forces continued their withdrawal towards Albania during the first week of November 1915 a process aided by the fact that the Germans Bulgarians and AustroHungarians were reluctant to pursue Serbian troops through the highlands of Albania The Germans felt that the war against Serbia was won with most of the nation under the control of the Central Powers Regarding the Russian Empire as the main threat in the East Mackensen was eager to move his forces back to the Russian front The Bulgarians were satisfied with their territorial gains in Macedonia and southeast Serbia while the AustroHungarians were equally content with the notion that the Bulgarians were not moving to establish a Greater Bulgaria The final confrontation occurred in Kosovo the Field of the Blackbirds between 19 and 24 November 1915 The Serbs were afflicted by a new outbreak of typhus while food and ammunition was in extremely short supply Facing inevitable defeat Putnik made his last and most painful order on 25 November  full retreat southwards and westwards through Montenegro and into Albania His goal was to reach allied ships that would he hoped transport the core of the army to the safety of the Ionian islands Many of the fleeing soldiers and civilians died during the retreat to the coast  lost to hunger disease attacks by enemy forces and Albanian tribal bands The circumstances of the retreat were disastrous and all told some 155000 Serbs out of 250000 mostly soldiers eventually reached the coast of the Adriatic Sea and embarked on Allied transport ships that carried the army to various Greek islands many to Corfu before being deployed at the Salonika front in April 1916 In worsening health Putnik had to be carried in a sedan chair during the retreat through snowy mountains of Albania exhausted by the effort and episodes of bronchitis influenza and pneumonia Putnik was met by allied forces in Scutari Skadar and transported first to Brindisi and then to Corfu along with the core of the army

In the atmosphere of recrimination that followed between the Serbian Government and the High Command the entire General Staff was dismissed in January 1916 including Field Marshal Putnik He felt embittered having learned of his dismissal from a cashier who gave him his salary without a Chief of General Staffs supplement He traveled to Nice where the French authorities welcomed him with honors and gave him a villa Putnik was overcome by lung emphysema and died on 17 May 1917 without seeing his homeland again His remains were transferred to Serbia in November 1926 and buried with honors in a chapel at Belgrades New Cemetery The grave carries the epitaph Grateful Homeland to Radomir Putnik

Mount Putnik in Alberta Canada was named after him in 1918 for his exceptional services to the allied cause He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs

Thomas Hinde
Doctor Thomas Hinde July 10 1737  September 28 1828 was Northern Kentuckys first physician a member of the British Royal Navy an American Revolutionary personal physician to Patrick Henry and treated General Wolfe when he died in Quebec Canada

Thomas Hinde is the patriarch of the Hinde family in the United States His youngest son Thomas S Hinde was a notable Methodist minister and businessman Charles T Hinde his grandson was a shipping magnate and Edmund C Hinde another grandson was an adventurer The Kavanaugh and Southgate branches of his family held elected office and positions of leadership in the Methodist church

As personal physician to Patrick Henry Hinde played a critical role in the American Revolutionary War through his vaccinations against smallpox and treatment of wounded soldiers For his service he received a large land grant in Kentucky where he moved with his family Hinde was northern Kentuckys first physician and a memorial was erected in Campbell County Kentucky to honor his services to the state He died in 1828 aged 91 which was unusually old for the time According to Otto Juettner in 1909 who was a famous medical doctor and medical historian Hinde never wrote a line in his life His life has been described as being like a romance and he was called a patriarch to the American medical profession

Hinde was born in Oxfordshire England in July 1737 He received a classical education in Oxfordshire and after completing his studies was sent to London England to study medicine He studied physics and surgery under Dr Thomas Brooke at Saint Thomas Hospital in London and at the age of nineteen was presented to the Company of Surgeons for a licence Shortly after he was commissioned as a Surgeons Mate in the Royal Navy and sailed for America with the forces commanded by General Amherst After landing in New York on June 10 1757 he spent time at Halifax and Louisbourg Hinde spent the winter of 1758 in Halifax and assisted Amherst with the reduction of Louisburg He was attached to the ship which bore the commander in chief General James Wolfe on his way to Quebec

Wolfe died in Hindes arms during the 1759 Battle of Quebec of the Seven Years War According to one source Hindes relationship with General Wolfe and his experiences in Quebec were some of the most cherished experiences of his life A painting of the death shows Dr Hinde compressing a wound to General Wolfes torsoIt is an oil on canvas of the Enlightenment period Benjamin West who painted it made a nearly identical painting of the same scene for King George III in 1771 After Wolfes death Hinde remained in the British Navy and was present for the reduction of Bellisle Shortly after Hinde was promoted and remained as a physician for a warship after the peace of 1763 He eventually resigned his commission

Copies of The Death of General Wolfe by West are currently in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada the Royal Ontario Museum Canadiana art collection the William L Clements Library at the University of Michigan and at Ickworth House Suffolk England

After the fall of Quebec Hinde returned briefly to England Peace with France was reached in 1763 and Hinde then returned to Virginia and settled He formed a close friendship with an unnamed Virginian who persuaded him to settle in a place called Hobbs Hole in Essex County Virginia and practice medicine Another source states that an aged physician in Virginia wrote to Dr Thomas Brooke Hindes mentor asking Brooke to send a young physician to assist him in his practice Brooke reportedly choose Hinde and earnestly advised him to avail himself of the situation which was offered Hinde accepted but moved soon after to settle in Newton now in West Virginia where he met his wife After their wedding Hinde moved again and settled in Hanover County Virginia

In 1765 after he settled in Virginia Hinde became acquainted with Patrick Henry one of the founding fathers of the United States Samuel Davis and Lord Dunmore Two years later he married Mary T Hubbard settled near Henry and became his family physician His association with Henry and settlement in Virginia helped Hinde become acquainted with many of the leading members of society during the period When Hinde first met Hubbard he found her to possess a great flow of animal spirits full of humor gay and lively inner temperament and disposition with strong powers of mind and at the same time active and sociable The couple married on September 24 1767 According to a biography written by George Coles in 1857 Henrys statesmanlike eloquence and political principles made a strong impression on Hinde and shifted him from being a staunch royalist to a sturdy republican

Hinde took an active part in the American Revolutionary War serving as a surgeon with Patrick and in various campaigns and battles At the time of the 1775 Gunpowder Incident Hinde was Chief Surgeon for Patrick Henry His involvement in it was the turning point that led him to embrace the cause of the oppressed colonies against Lord Dunmore and the English royalty The Gunpowder Incident was a conflict early in the American Revolutionary War between Lord Dunmore the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia and militia led by Henry Hinde originally planned to take a frontline post in Henrys regiment but when Henry was elected Governor Hinde was instead appointed to inoculate all members of the continental service Because of insufficient funds in the continental army Hinde was forced to cover the costs of inoculations which seriously impaired his private fortune One source states that Hinde amputated limbs during the war by the cartload After the war Hinde continued to live in Hanover County for many years primarily practicing medicine

After the American Revolutionary War Hinde moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky having received a large land grant for his services in the war One source describes the land grant as follows
At the close of the war having drawn no part of his salary and from his great skill as a surgeon having endeared himself to the Virginians in settling up his accounts he was presented with a land warrant to be located in lands selected in Kentucky leaving a blank within the warrant for the number of acres to filled by Dr Hinde himself The blank was filled with twenty thousand and placed in the hands of Patrick Henry to select and locate the lands

For undisclosed reasons Henry was unable to complete the land grant to Hinde due to surveying difficulties who then used his nephew Hubbard Taylor to go to Kentucky find the location and complete the transaction Hinde gave Taylor half of the lands for this service The land was in Clark County Kentucky between Winchester and Lexington

During his early years in England Hinde was a member of the Church of England but he abandoned the church as an adult and had become a Deist One biographer stated that for a time Hinde took pride and pleasure in ridiculing Christianity In later years however his religious views underwent a radical change

In 1798 Methodist ministers arrived in Hindes neighborhood and began to convert people Susanna one of Hindes daughters converted causing distress to the family Hinde banished her from his home and she went to live with her aunt forty miles away However this failed because the aunt had already converted and Hindes wife converted soon after Hinde became convinced that the disorder was in their heads and treated them with medical procedures of the day such as a blistering plaster to the whole length of the spine which he left on for several days Drake states that through this measure of violence he hoped to deter her from further attendance at places of public worship The procedures were painful but his wife stated afterwards that it was a punishment but I never was so happy in all my life Hinde later felt guilt for having banished his daughter and performed medical operations on his wife and he converted to Methodism His daughter returned home and his wife began attending Methodist gatherings regularly Two of his daughters married traveling preachers and another daughter converted to Methodism too By the end of his life Hinde was a devout Methodist According to one account
At another time he was taking a morning walk and met Gen James Taylor a relative by marriage who said Goodmorning doctor where are you going I am going to heaven where are you going general The general at that time had some doubts about whether his road led to the same country and made no reply but it is hoped he found the way to everlasting life before he left the world

One of Hindes grandchildren states that Hinde built little houses of sticks and wood where he would pray The grandchildren called them Grandpas prayerhouses Hinde could be heard praying from a considerable distance

Hinde married Mary Todd Hubbard the daughter of Benjamin Hubbard an English merchant and they were married for 61 years They had eight children that lived to adulthood His daughter Ann Winston Hinde married Richard Southgate on July 30 1799 in Newport Kentucky Hinde and his family were members of the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church in Newport Kentucky

One of Hindes sons was Thomas S Hinde who was a cofounder of Mount Carmel Illinois and became a wellrespected Methodist minister Hindes grandson Captain Charles T Hinde was a successful businessman and riverboat captain Charles was one of the principal investors in the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego California and inspired Frederick Hinde Zimmerman Dr Hindes greatgrandson to build the Grand Rapids Hotel in Mount Carmel Illinois

In his later life Hinde lived with his daughter Mary McKinney of Newport Kentucky

Panurge opera
Panurge is an opera titled Haulte farce musicale in three acts by Jules Massenet to a French libretto by Georges Spitzmuller and Maurice Boukay after Pantagruel by Rabelais It was first performed at the Thtre de la Gat in Paris on 25 April 1913 nearly a year after Massenets death one of three operas by the composer to have premiered posthumously the others being Cloptre 1914 and Amadis 1922

It is one of Massenets least known operas but was revived at the Massenet Festival in St Etienne in 1994 under conductor Patrick Fournillier Harding quotes a reaction of Alfred Bruneau who declared that the libretto was not suited to Massenets temperament and demanded music not of a Massenet but of a Chabrier

A crowd of townspeople have gathered outside the tavern of Alcofibras the Hostellerie du Coq  lAsne in Les Halles on Mardi Gras Pantagruel and his squires order wine Panurge has entered and Pantagruel beckons the hungry newcomer to join his party Panurge addresses his host in Italian German and finally French Panurge claims that he has lost his wife Colombe that very morning and cant decide whether to laugh or cry The others encourage him to drown his sorrows in wine 
Once everyone has entered the tavern Colombe herself comes along and hears the voice of her husband she explains that she feigned death to escape his drunken behaviour She calls on him to come out and presents herself to him but he says that he does not recognize her Enraged Colombe is held by Pantagruels squires while Parnuge escapes with Pantagruel to a monastery where he can hide from his wife

At daybreak in the main courtyard of the Abbaye de Thlme Thelemites and Ribaude greet the morning When the crowd has left Panurge enters pleased with such a congenial refuge and makes advances to Ribaude Pantagruel arrives with his followers and Jean welcomes as an old friend describing the customs of the monastery where there is no Lent and monks pray to Bacchus and nuns to Venus
Colombe also now enters having followed her husband to the abbey and meets Ribaude who lets her know that Panurge was courting her only just before
A large meal is prepared in the courtyard by the servants instead of saying grace Pantagruel only praises the vine Panurge wonders whether he should remarry as he cant recall his former wife and asks for counsel from the philosopher Bridoye the poet Raminagrobis and the physician Rondibilis
When Ribaude reenters Panurge tries to flirt with her again but is spurned by Ribaude who knows that he is married Colombe sits at Pantagruels table and makes confession to Panurge disguised as a monk of all her transgressions Panurge cannot contain his jealousy and tells her that he knows the husband who has fled to the Ile des Lanternes Colombe says that she will pursue him and leaves while in a fury Panurge breaks everything at the tables

Colombe dressed as a priestess and oracle of Bacchus tells the Queen of the Lanternois how she misses her husband Panurge arrives looking for his wife Queen Baguenaude invites him to rest awhile and consult the oracle of Bacchus Colombe prepares to assume the part of Sibyl while Panurge offers to make a sacrifice of a lamb He rejects the price demanded and tosses the lamb into the sea after which the shepherd and locals dive in to rescue it
The Sibyl now enters and answers Panurges enquiries saying that he will find his wife when he drinks less and stops beating her Jean Pantagruel and the followers next arrive by boat Colombe having taken off the disguise joins her husband and calls for wine the Queen reminds Panurge of his oath All raise their cups in rejoicing as the curtain falls

USS War Hawk
USS War Hawk AP168 was a La Salleclass transport ship of the United States Navy built at the Moore Dry Dock Company in Oakland California in 1942 The La Salleclass transport had a displacement of almost 14000 tons and were designed to ferry troops and supplies to and from the war zone during World War II

War Hawk carried eight LCVP Higgins Boat type landing craft used to move troops and four LCMs used to move heavy equipment to and from the shore

Her keel was laid down on 24 December 1942 The hull was completed in a little over three months and was launched on 3 April 1943 under the command of Commander S H Thompson After launch War Hawk was fitted out and acquired by the United States Navy on 9 March 1944 She was commissioned on the same day and designated AP168

On 21 April 1944 she left the San Francisco Bay headed for Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu At Pearl Harbor War Hawk joined the 5th Fleet Amphibious Force and after training left for her part in Operation Forager the liberation of the Marianas Islands At the time of the landing there were about 59000 Japanese troops stations in the Southern Marianas Islands in particular on Saipan Tinian and Guam

The assault on Marianas was conducted with overwhelming force All total there were 198 vessels involved including 110 transports and auxiliary ships and 88 warships These ships carried and supported a force of 110000 men However Saipan had been in Japanese control for more than ten years and was heavily fortified There were approximately 31000 Japanese troops including navy and well entrenched on the island

War Hawk arrived at Saipan on 15 June 1944 and landed elements of the 2nd Marine Division on the southwestern shore of the island Sometime during the next eight days War Hawk helped fight off two Japanese air attacks During this time she also took on eleven seriously wounded Japanese prisoners of war As was the nature of many Japanese soldiers the only way they would be taken prisoner was if they could not fight The extent of their wounds was so great that all eleven died in spite of efforts of War Hawks medical staff They were buried at sea Four days after the landing the Allies engaged the Japanese Navy in the Philippine Sea and inflicted tremendous damage This battle prevented the Imperial Japanese Navy from resupplying their troops in the Marianas leaving a brutal war of attrition for the Japanese until the commanding officer General Yoshitsugu Sait committed suicide and the island was declared liberated on 9 July 1944

As the fighting on Saipan came to a close some of War Hawks sister ships began moving troops from Saipan to Tinian War Hawk did not directly participate in the invasion of Tinian However several LCVPs en route to Saipans beachheads came within range of what were apparently 20mm explosive shell fire from Tinian which is only a few miles off the coast of Saipan There were no hits but lots of spray as the shells hit around the boats

On 23 June 1944 War Hawk headed back to Pearl Harbor where she picked up elements of the United States Armys 77th Infantry and returned to the Marianas She landed her troops on Guam on 21 July She loitered in the area for several more days before returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 June There she spent a month practicing with new troops from the Armys 96th Infantry Division before leaving again for the South Pacific Theater

En route she was diverted from the canceled invasion of Yap to take part in the invasion of the Philippines

During the latter part of 1944 and early 1945 War Hawk participated in the operations to liberate the Philippines She left Pearl Harbor carrying elements of the Armys 96th Infantry Division and headed for Yap Island in the Carolines En route she changed heading for Eniwetok as the invasion of Yap was canceled After leaving Eniwetok she sailed for Manus She headed to the Philippines on 14 October 1944 to take part in the invasion of Leyte

Leyte was heavily defended by 20000 Japanese troops The Imperial Japanese Army had decided that it was best to fortify the Philippines to prevent the Allies from moving north through them to the Japanese homeland In total there were about 432000 troops on the various Philippine Islands There were also between 100 and 120 operational Japanese air bases that would be used to provide air attacks during any amphibious invasion

The approach to the landing was from the southwest through the Leyte Gulf The beaches were between the cities of Tacloban and Dulag on the northeast side of the island In total the Leyte invasion was the largest invasion mounted in the Pacific to date There were a combined total of 701 ships of which 157 were warships The transports put six Army divisions and one battalion of Rangers onto Leyte in just a few days

It was during this phase of the war that General Douglas MacArthur waded ashore at Red Beach and issued his famous I have returned speech to the people of the Philippines Carl Mydans a photographer for TimeLife took the famous photograph of MacArthur wading ashore on Red Beach on 9 January 1945 War Hawk landed her troops not far away at Green Beach

In the evening of 21 October 1944 War Hawk was maneuvering through Leyte Gulf and rammed the battleship near the stern Tennessee was laying dead in the water and generating smoke to protect the ships from air attack No one was hurt on either ship The damage to Tennessee was light but War Hawk sustained moderate damage near the bow

One of the more interesting pieces of cargo that War Hawk landed at Leyte was a Piper Cub artillery spotting aircraft It left Pearl Harbor loaded onto the deck of War Hawk with its wings removed and was put ashore by an LCM Before the aircraft could be assembled a Japanese mortar round knocked a palm tree over onto it

After the initial invasion of Leyte War Hawk sailed back to Dutch New Guinea where she picked up a field hospital unit and returned to Leyte War Hawk returned to New Britain and picked up troops from the Armys 40th Infantry Division and returned to Luzon

The next step in the liberation of the Philippines was the invasion of the island of Luzon the island on which the capitol Manila resides The invasion of Luzon began in the Lingayen Gulf on the western side of the island on 9 January 1945 In just a few days War Hawk and her sister ships had landed almost 175000 troops mostly made up of the 6th Army These troops began a push east north and south towards Manila

Initially beach resistance was light and with a low surf War Hawk was able to put her troops and supplies almost directly onto the beach There was some fire from Japanese gun emplacements These emplacements were often made of layers of coconut logs which being very spongy were very resistant to everything but the large caliber weapons

At 0410 hours on the morning of 10 January 1945 War Hawk was anchored in Lingayen Gulf where she was attacked in the dark by a Shinyo suicide boat These boats were small motorboats laden with up to two tons of explosives in the bow Lookouts reported hearing an approaching boat when the Shinyo rammed the port side of the ship The explosion blew a hole in hold number three killing 61 men Commander Thompsons official Action Report filed on 18 January 1945 states that 23 people were missing and unaccounted for 20 minutes after the explosion He does not give details on the wounded The damage to the ship was extensive including flooding in the engine room which knocked out power With the ship dead in the water the crew struggled to keep her afloat restore power and fight off continuing Japanese air attacks throughout the day That same day two Landing Craft Infantry LCI365 and LCI974 were sunk in the same area by Shinyo boats

By 11 January the hole had been buttressed and partial power had been restored and War Hawk began a long slow journey back to Leyte Gulf Two days later 13 January the gun crews downed a kamikaze aircraft splattering the bow with flaming debris Once in Leyte Gulf further and more permanent repairs were made to the ship enabling her to sail to Manus in the Admiralty Islands for further dry dock work She set sail for San Francisco Bay on 22 February 1945

War Hawk was repaired at an unknown dock facility in San Francisco Bay and set sail for San Diego on 29 May 1945 There she picked up troops from an unspecified division and returned to Guam in the Marianas She made one more trip back to San Francisco for a load of naval replacements and headed for Eniwetok Ulithi and Leyte Gulf While en route she received word that the United States had dropped two atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese had agreed to an unconditional surrender

War Hawk was decommissioned on 12 August 1946 in Seattle Washington She became the property of the Maritime Commission on 13 August after sailing to Olympia Washington and was eventually struck from the Navy List on 8 October 1946

The Waterman Steamship Corporation of Mobile Alabama purchased her on 4 February 1948 and operated her until 1964 as a freighter After her service with Waterman War Hawk was sold to the Ocean Transport Company of New York and renamed Ocean Dinny She operated with under Ocean Clippers Inc until 1966 when she was sold again to her last owner of record the Overseas Carrier Corporation She was scrapped at Kaohsiung in January 1971

Modernist Swedish literature
The period of Modernistic Swedish literature started in the 1910s Some regard 1910 itself as the beginning when August Strindberg published several critical newspaper articles contesting many conservative values Several other years are also possible What is undisputed is that with the advent of social democracy and large labor strikes the winds of the 1910s blew in the direction of a working class reformation

After World War I 19141919 literature was marked by despair depicted in works of Pr Lagerkvist Hjalmar Bergman and Birger Sjberg Literature moved in the direction of proletariat writings during the interwar years and the remainders of folklore had been reduced to virtual insignificance

Proletarian writing had its strongest period in 19201940 Artur Lundkvist and the literary group Fem unga played a key role in introducing literary modernism with an anthology published in 1929
Notable proletarian writers were Moa Martinson 18901964 who wrote about the difficulties women had in factory and farm work and her husband Harry Martinson 19041978 who wrote about the fragility of human beings But the most distinguished proletarian writer of the time was Ivar LoJohansson 19011990 writing about the Swedish landworkers in novels short stories and journalism and also engaging in public debates about many other topics

In the late 1930s the political developments in Germany had their effects on Swedish literature Taking a stand against National Socialism Pr Lagerkvist wrote the novels Bdeln 1933 and Dvrgen The Dwarf 1944 both investigating human evil A stand again National Socialism was also made by Karin Boye in the novel Kallocain 1940 set in a future totalitarian world the novel has since been translated into ten languages During the war Eyvind Johnson also took a recognized stand with his The Krilon Group series 19411943 a massive work speaking strongly in favour of democratic values condemning dictatorship and worship of power

Orban has not joined a political party but is of liberal political leaning He participated as an independent in the European Parliament political group Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ALDE

As European Commissioner for Multilingualism in the Barroso Commission Orban was responsible for the language policy of the European Union ie promoting multilingualism for the citizens and the institutions of the European Union He was the first to hold this portfolio Multilingualism has previously and subsequently been a responsibility of the European Commissioner for Education Training Culture and Multilingualism Jn Fige the first Commissioner whose portfolio explicitly included multilingualism

Politically the portfolio is focused on promoting foreign languages learning specifically an individuals mother tongue plus two other languages as means for the workers mobility and business competitiveness

Though awareness for linguistic diversity is a policy target the language rights of speakers of regional minority lesserused and migrant languages are not legally protected In the European Union language policy is the responsibility of member states and European Union does not have a common language policy Based on the principle of subsidiarity European Union institutions play a supporting role in this field promoting cooperation between the member states and promoting the European dimension in their language policies particularly through the teaching and dissemination of their languages The content of educational systems is the responsibility of individual member states and the European Union has very limited influence in this area However a number of European Union funded programmes actively promote language learning most prominently under the much wider Lifelong learning Programme 20072013 Though regional and minority languages can benefit from European Union programmes protection of linguistic rights is a matter for the member states

Orban was also responsible for the effective functioning of the European Unions extensive interpretation translation and publication services in the 23 official languages of the Union Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity In many of these issues responsibility was shared with other Commissioners namely the European Commissioner for Education Training and Culture Jn Fige Orban was also responsible alongside the President of the Commission Barroso and Fige to work on intercultural dialogue including the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue

According to Article 45 of the protocol to the Accession Treaty of Bulgaria and Romania the new members of the Commission representing the acceding member states were appointed by the Council of the European Union in common accord with the President of the Commission and after consultation with the European Parliament Compared to former enlargements of the European Union the Accession Treaty for Bulgaria and Romania for the first time contains an explicit acknowledgement of the Parliaments role and constitutes the formal legal basis for the new Commissioners appointment procedure

On 30 October 2006 in agreement with the President of the Commission Barroso the Romanian government nominated Leonard Orban as Commissioner designate for Romania Barroso assigned him the portfolio of multilingualism Before Orban Varujan Vosganian a former Romanian National Liberal Party Minister of Economy and Commerce had been nominated but withdrew his candidature due to allegations concerning his past involvement with the secret police under Ceauescu and party financing by a tycoon National Liberal Party foreign minister Mihai Rzvan Ungureanu refused a nomination

The assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the Romanian Commissioner by Barroso was highly controversial Barroso was severely criticized for creating a new Commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in 2007 could hold a post The portfolio was criticized for being too light for such a highrank official that there would be an overlap of responsibilities with other Commissioners and the good functioning of the Commission would be endangered The portfolio was considered insubstantial for a Commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the EU in affecting language policy and the more administrative rather than political character of the post In addition it appeared that the portfolio had been created to complete a 27strong Commission Romanias appointment of a technocrat rather than a politician given the countrys deficits in interior and justice policies especially in terms of corruption would result in the Romanian Commissioner taking a degraded portfolio This criticism came from the Social Democratic Party PSD Romanias main opposition party the Socialist Group PES in the European Parliament and the liberal Financial Times newspaper Socialist Group leader Martin Schulz suggested a portfolio for the protection of ethnic minorities instead The Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament asked Barroso to clarify the mandate of the Commissioner for Multilingualism as well as the mandate of the other members of the Commission with regards to the intercultural dialogue Barroso turned down the PES proposal and defended the post He stated that Jn Fige the Commissioner for Education Training and Culture will remain responsible for the management of actions to directly promote the intercultural dialogue

After a public hearing in Brussels at the Committee on Culture and Education CULT of the European Parliament in participation with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs AFCO on27 November 2006 the Committee gave a positive assessment On December 12 2006 Orban received the formal approval of the European Parliament in Strasbourg with 595 votes in favour 16 against and 29 abstentions The Socialist Group voted for Orban laying the blame for the portfolios mandate on the President of the Commission rather than the Commissioner designate On 1 January 2007 he was appointed by the Council and on 22 January 2007 in a ceremony in Luxembourg Orban was sworn in before the European Court of Justice

Orban held the position of European Commissioner until 31 October 2009 when the remaining term of office for the Barroso Commission ends

In his hearing at the European Parliament Leonard Orban focused on defending the importance of his post in presenting the EU language policy emphasising foreign language learning and describing the concrete initiatives he intended to implement

Orban said that he intended to spearhead the Commissions work on a portfolio that has become more important with every enlargement and assured the Members of the European Parliament that his portfolio was a substantial one covering a range of important political and managerial responsibilities He also described how his portfolio would contribute to economic competitiveness the social dimension of the EU and the intercultural dialogue and stated that it would provide a forum for European political dialogue

Orban told the Committee that the multilingual dimension of the EU must be made mainstream in all relevant EU policies and programmes and should not be seen as a separate isolated policy He stated that Politically I will steer the Commissions work on bringing an active multilingualism policy into a variety of policies which are the key to the functioning of the EU and the internal market culture education and competitiveness In addition he claimed that multilingualism would be commercially advantageous as At first sight one single language might appear easier to manage  but multilingualism can also give any industry a competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism According to Orban multilingualism promotes labour mobility tolerance and a sense of European citizenship and as an integral aspect of the legitimacy transparency and democracy of the European integration it contributes to a successful EU communication policy Within the Lisbon strategy the target for foreign language learning is mother tongue plus two which means that English language skills on their own are not sufficient To address this Orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more languagefriendly He underlined that our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to EU languages we are also encouraging training in Chinese Japanese Arabic Turkish and Russian He added that The promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity is a general objective of the new programme for lifelong learning launched in 2007 For the first time it will be open to all languages spoken in the European Union as well as to the languages of the EUs main trading partners Orban claims that respect for linguistic diversity and the fight against discrimination on the basis of language are cornerstones for a social Europe he states that Europes linguistic and cultural diversity is a source of richness which also needs to be nurtured and promoted which presumably includes all languages national regional minority and migrant However Orban agreed that the protection of language rights was a matter for individual member states and his view is that When it comes to language rights I am not in favour of adopting legislation at European level to be imposed on Member States

Orbans remit included the development of the European Indicator of Language Competence the creation of a Business Forum on Multilingualism and Juvenes Translatores a translation contest between schools from all over Europe as part of the events marking the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 20072013 and other educational and cultural programmes Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes including the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development the European Social Fund and immigration initiatives He also intended to contribute to the 2008 European Year of Intercultural Dialogue where multilingualism played a fundamental part On planning further policy Orban promised to carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism Before the end of 2007 I would organise a Ministerial conference to discuss the way forward I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area

His views on multilingualism fall in line with the current European Union language policy as described in the Communication from the Commission A New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism on 22 November 2005

Orban defended Romanias accession to the EU believing that Romania can only gain from its entry and stressing the importance of a postaccession strategy for his country

On the future of Europe Orban believes in a strong cohesive European Union capable of being a major actor on the global scene In addition he stressed the need to increase the pace of the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy a tenyear strategy designed to make the European Union the worlds most competitive economy by 2010 Institutionally he supported the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe voted down in referendums in France and Netherlands in 2005 believing that it should be ratified by the member states without further negotiations or without excluding some of its provisions

Nigori
Nigori or is a variety of sake an alcoholic beverage produced from rice Its name translates roughly to cloudy because of its appearance It is about 1217 alcohol by volume averaging 15 with some as high as 20 

Sake is usually filtered to remove grain solids left behind after the fermentation process Nigori sake is filtered using a broader mesh resulting in the permeating of fine rice particles and a far cloudier drink Unfiltered sake is known as doburoku  but also  and was originally brewed across Japan by farming families However it was banned in the Meiji period though it has since been revived as a local brewing tradition The area around Mihara village in southern Shikoku is especially wellknown for its doburoku breweries

Brewer Tokubee Masuda of Kyotobased Tsukino Katsura brewery which began in 1675 looked to bring back hundredyearold recipes and traditional production methods available to modernize their products Beginning in 1964 or 1966 Masuda began lobbying the Japanese government to relax sake productionlaws in order to produce an unfiltered sake that would be cloudy and offer a visual component similar to European wines The result was a sake that was cloudy effervescent unpasteurized and slightly sweeter Author John Gauntner discussing the production process that allowed nigori to be considered as sake notesWhat they did was create a cagelike device an insert with holes in its walls that fit into a tank of sake The sake that leaked through the holes in the center of the insert was then drawn off and bottled The government determined that as long as the holes in the mesh were no larger than 2 millimeters in diameter the result of filtration using the cage could legally be considered sake Hence nigori was born as a genre of sake Other breweries later followed suit using their own contraptionsGauntner also remarked that currently most brewers no longer bother filtering out the sake but will instead dilute the final product with filtered sake Formerly only water could be added to sake after fermenting but current laws state that only water and sake can be added afterward

In 2010 a brewer from Akita Prefecture came up with a dark version of nigori sake the color of which is due to the addition of edible finely powdered charcoal

Nigori sake is generally the sweetest of all sake with a fruity nose and a mild flavor making a great drink to complement spicy foods or as a dessert wine Before serving the bottle is shaken properly to mix the sediment with the sake to obtain the full range of flavor and its signature look It is advised that it be served wellchilled storing it in an ice bucket to keep it from warming up between servings It is recommended as with most sake to consume the entire bottle once opened before it begins to oxidize altering its flavor

Nigori sake is more popular in the United States than in Japan as are other less traditional varieties which has led to an increase of American sake brewers

Swedish childrens literature
The Swedish childrens literature tradition was initiated by the Swedishspeaking Finn Zacharius Topelius in the 19th century It flourished at the dawn of the 20th century with Elsa Beskow 18741953 who wrote and illustrated some 40 childrens stories between 18971952 Her books were beloved and have continued to be reprinted in Sweden and many other languages

In the 1930s a new awareness of childrens need emerged It was realized that children did not only warrant disciplinary and moralizing literature but also childlike books to foster their imagination This manifested itself shortly after World War II when Astrid Lindgren published Pippi Longstocking in 1945 Pippis rebellious behaviour at first sparked resistance among some defenders of cultural values but eventually she was accepted and with that childrens literature was freed from the obligation to promote moralism
Astrid Lindgren continued to publish many bestselling childrens books which eventually made her the most read Swedish author of all categories with over 100 million copies printed throughout the world translated into over 80 languages Lindgren showed in many other books her fine comprehension of childlike thought and values in The Brothers Lionheart about death as well as a tale of bravery in Mio My Son a fairy tale about friendship

But not all her stories had deep messages at least on the surface Three books on KarlssonontheRoof 1955 62 68 are about a short chubby and mischievous man with a propeller on his back who is befriended by a boy The stories of KarlssonontheRoof became one of the most loved childrens stories in Russia during the Soviet era And in twelve books Astrid wrote about Emil of Maple Hills a boy on the Smland countryside in the early 1900s who continuously gets intro trouble because of his pranks She also wrote many other appreciated books most of them were filmed some with good results that have led to them being continuously rerun on Swedish television

One of the few fantasy writers in Swedish literature was Tove Jansson 19142001 who wrote her stories of the Moomins in nine books and four picture books between 1946 and 1993 Jansson was from Finlands Swedishspeaking minority and wrote in Swedish The Moomins are trolls that live in an economically and politically independent state without any material necessities Perhaps this explains the vast popularity the Moomins have enjoyed in many different countries The Moomin books have been translated into over 30 languages

More recently other childrens authors have become notable such as Maria Gripe Gunnel Linde Inger and Lasse Sandberg Sven Nordqvist with the Pettson and Findus series Moni Brnnstrm Anders Jacobsson and Sren Olsson

Virtual artifact
A virtual artifact VA is an immaterial object that exists in the human mind or in a digital environment for example the Internet intranet virtual reality cyberspace etc

The term virtual artifact has been used in a variety of ways in scientific and public discourse Previously it has referred to objects of different nature eg images user interfaces models prototypes computer animation virtual books that exist in digital environments The concept behind the term is rapidly developing and expanding as new phenomena emerge in the virtual domain

Imaginary worlds characters items etc have been described in stories and tales since the dawn of humanity In the philosophic discourse utopias have existed where extensive systems and their components have been depicted in detail Imaginary artifacts have been described and created in terms of language and visual presentation The development of the visual presentation techniques eg linear perspective cinematography enabled more sophisticated methods to describe these artifacts events and entities in painting photography and film Moreover virtual artifacts were and still are commonly found in environments that require a strong imaginary aspect in order to be experienced such as radio shows novels tabletop roleplaying games etc

The development of computing enabled the creation of interactive virtual environments that were based on digital technologies and new methods of presentation In digital environments virtual artifacts became independent entities that could exist and interact outside the human mind Even previously unknown complex forms and imaginary artifacts eg fractals could be created and represented in these environments

Humans have expanded the existing environment to the virtual domain Virtual artifacts can be seen as an essential cultural phenomenon in modern society Virtual artifacts bear meanings and functions and since they are part of the world they affect real world events and peoples lives

Virtual artifacts have certain similarities to reallife artifacts even though they do not have physical properties in the traditional sense However reallife objects and environments can be simulated in digital environments like computer games 3D modeling or virtual reality Simulated virtual objects photorealistic VA and environments have a model in the real world however depending on the context an abstract virtual artifact isnt necessarily dependent on the laws of physics or causality

Some virtual artifacts are purely abstract in their nature therefore they cant model reallife objects or phenomena For example computer programs or digital user interfaces while often containing representative components of reallife objects cant exist in physical terms These virtual artifacts do not have to be comprehensible to humans at all they can be created and understood solely by artificial intelligence

Virtual artifacts can have physical properties for example color length depending on the environment they exist in These physical properties can be presented and perceived using a certain medium such as a computer screen On the other hand virtual artifacts can also contain properties that arent perceptible Due to their immaterial nature they can be flexibly accessed reproduced and archivedeven simultaneously by multiple users


Virtual artifacts can have a virtual andor real exchange value and thus can be considered as products A person or other juristically defined actor can claim ownership and invest money in virtual artifacts Virtual artifacts can also be valuable in an economical sense outside the environment eg a virtual world such as ones found in massively multiplayer online games they are created in For example game items and characters are valued in terms of real currencies

Within many virtual worlds there exists a virtual economy that often mimics reallife commercial features and models such as trading with ingame virtual artifacts virtual currencies supply and demand etc

There is a viable reallife business model based on the exchange of virtual artifacts within a virtual environment One example is the social networking game Habbo Hotel in Habboworld users buy virtual products such as furniture for their virtual hotel room with real money Many online games require a paid subscription for providing access to the game world creating revenue to the creator of the world

Moreover virtual game environments have also created commercial models around them In fact the market for virtual artifacts such as game items or virtual property is booming In China for example people are hired to play online games to develop game characters and collect game resources Furthermore virtual environments have enabled the production and commercialization of virtual artifacts created by enduserscreating new markets and effectively blurring the line between real and virtual consumerism
