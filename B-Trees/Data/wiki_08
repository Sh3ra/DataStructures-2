Founding Father short story
Founding Father is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov It was first published in the October 1965 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction and reprinted in the 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories It was inspired by a cover painting of a spacehelmeted face backed by several crosses provided by the magazines editor Frederik Pohl

An exploratory spacecraft of the Galactic Corps charged with opening up planets for human colonisation sometimes by terraforming crashlands on an alien planet They find that the ecology is heavy in ammonia making the atmosphere unbreathable by humans and the soil unsuitable for the Earthtype plants they have brought for colonisation

As they are unable to take off again the crew spend their time trying to adjust the environment to make it suitable for possible future human colonists by cultivating Earth plants which will create oxygen Although they spend many years at this task they fail and one by one they die of ammonia poisoning 

As the last man dies the flesh of the buried crew feeds the plants and finally helps them to flourish providing the catalyst that alters the environment to become more Earthlike

Hot Water Beach
Hot Water Beach is a beach on Mercury Bay on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula New Zealand approximately 12 kilometres south east of Whitianga and approximately 175 kilometres from Auckland by car Its name comes from underground hot springs which filter up through the sand between the high and low water tidal reaches The beach is a popular destination both for locals and tourists visiting New Zealand Annual visitor numbers have been estimated at 700000 making it one of the most popular geothermal attractions in the Waikato Region

Within two hours either side of low tide it is possible to dig into the sand allowing hot water to escape to the surface forming a hot water pool The water with a temperature as hot as 64C 147F filters up from two underground fissures located close to each other These natural springs can be found on the beach opposite the offshore rocks Visitors often dig large holes and relax and soak in the thermal water Many visitors bring a spade and bucket with them Spades can also be hired from the nearby surf shop

Care needs to be exercised as the location of the hot springs are not far from the sea even at low tide and visitors may be caught unaware by the large breaking waves Hot Water Beach is known for its dangerous rip currents holes and large waves Signs at the beach advise swimmers not to swim within 50m either side of the offshore rocks opposite the springs and to only swim between the flags if the Hot Water Beach Lifeguard Service are on patrol Hot Water Beachs rip currents have claimed the lives of several unwary visitors and only strong and experienced swimmers are advised to enter the water

Rima Ariadaeus
Rima Ariadaeus is a linear rille on the Moon at  It is named after the crater Ariadaeus which marks its eastern end It is over 300 km long and is categorized as a straight rille because of its linear nature 

Some scientists think that the linear rilles might have formed after large impact events while others believe that the rilles were formed as a surface manifestation of deepseated dike systems when the Moon was still volcanically active Rima Ariadaeus is thought to have been formed when a section of the Moons crust sank down between two parallel fault lines making it a graben or fault trough Rima Ariadaeus shows no trace of associated volcanism and is thus considered to be an end member of the sequence where only pure faulting is involved ie a linear rille

The ridges crossing the rille trough of Rima Ariadaeus and the surrounding plains units have been offset by the trough proving that the ridges are older than the faults Some craters are cut off by the faults and are therefore older Other craters lie on the wall of the trough and are younger than the faulting The faulting must be relatively young because so few craters appear to be younger than the faults and because the edges of the trough appear to be crisp and little affected by slumping and other mass wasting

Apollo mission photographs of the Rima Ariadaeus revealed a 300 kmlong rift line on the surface of the moon On being asked in 2010 about Internet suggestions that this was proof of the Quranic story NASA scientist Brad Bailey said My recommendation is to not believe everything you read on the internet Peerreviewed papers are the only scientifically valid sources of information out there No current scientific evidence reports that the Moon was split into two or more parts and then reassembled at any point in the past

The splitting of the moon was reportedly a miracle attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad It is perhaps alluded to in the Quranic verses 5412

Three of Swords
Three of Swords is the third card of the suit of swords The suit is present in Italian Spanish and tarot decks 

This card depicts a fundamentally sorrowful experience tarot readers suggest this may be in the form of a lost relationship an accidental death or some other form of not just depression or malaise but deeply emotional sorrow When the card appears reversed in a spread this is not usually read as meaning the opposite of sorrow but rather a sorrow that is somehow mitigated by its circumstances or that is not as bad as it could have been It is among the most negative cards within the tarot deck

In response to Dhammikas question the Buddha first addresses his monks and advises them as follows

The Buddha notes that a householders obligations prevent a householder from fully pursuing a monks path Thus the Buddha articulates the laymans duty Pali gahatthavatta what are essentially the Five Precepts as follows

For the Uposatha the Buddha extols the practice of the Eight Precepts which involve the aforementioned Five Precepts with celibacy alone identified for the third precept and the following three precepts added
The Buddha further stated that when celebrating the Uposatha with a purified heart Pali pasanna citto and rejoicing mind Pali anumodamno the wise Pali viu share their food and drink with monks of the Sangha

Stephen Atkins Swails
Stephen Atkins Swails 23 February 1832  17 May 1900 was a soldier in the Union Army during the American Civil War Although originally enlisting as a private he was the first AfricanAmerican soldier promoted to commissioned rank as a line officer in that conflict as evidenced by the US War Departments initial refusal of that promotion due to his African descent

Swails was a free black who was so light in coloring that he was often mistaken as white He was single and employed mostly as a waiter in Cooperstown New York at the start of the Civil War and although he fathered several children by Sarah Thompson they never married His enlistment papers state he was employed as a boatman in Elmira New York when he joined the army In 1863 he answered Frederick Douglass call to arms and joined the 54th Massachusetts when it began forming and served in that regiment eventually being commissioned as an officer until the end of the war After the war he settled in South Carolina and later Washington DC becoming a lawyer and politician

Stephen Swails was a member of the 54th Massachusetts enlisting and then rising through the ranks to receive a commission He joined Company F of the 54th on 23 April 1863 and was soon appointed the companys first sergeant Due to the loss of men in the assault on Fort Wagner and when Colonel Edward Hallowell assumed command of the 54th Swails was appointed acting sergeantmajor of the 54th on 12 November 1863

In early 1864 the regiment was posted to Florida as part of General Truman Seymours expedition On 20 February while still performing duty as the regiments sergeantmajor Swails was wounded in the head at the Battle of Olustee Setting out toward the Union supply point at Sanderson he soon fell unconscious on the road but was placed on a cart by one of the 54ths officers On 26 February 1864 Colonel Hallowell
In accordance with the desire of his officers as well as his own recommended to Governor Andrew that Sergeant Swails be commissioned in recognition of many soldiery qualities and his gallantry at Olustee 
On 26 March 1864 the regiment received a list of promotions approved by Governor Andrew one of which was Swails promotion to 2nd lieutenant Thus began the fight to secure for Stephen Swails what may have been the first commission as a line officer given to an African American in the Union Army

In May 1864 while the regiment was posted on Morris Island South Carolina during the siege of Charleston Swails application to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment was refused by the War Department The reason given was Lieutenant Swails African descent Colonel William Gurney the post commander ordered Swails to remove his officers uniform and reassume duties as an enlisted man However Colonel Hallowell obtained a furlough for Swails and sent him along with all the necessary paperwork to Major General John Foster commander of the Department of the South Once there Lieutenant Swails presented his case and received General Fosters recommendation which was forwarded to higher authority Lieutenant Swails then returned to duty with the regiment In addition to correspondence between the Department of the South Governor Andrew and the War Department Lieutenant Swails also received a furlough to travel to Washington to present his own case He then returned to duty Finally on 17 January 1865 orders were received from the War Department authorizing Stephen Swails to muster as a 2nd lieutenant with the regiment ending almost a yearlong struggle on his behalf by Colonel Hallowell Governor Andrew and the officers of the 54th During this period Swails continued to perform his duties as a line officer in Company D and participated in numerous actions

On 11 April 1865 near Camden South Carolina Lieutenant Swails was wounded for a second time While the 54th was on reconnaissance near a railroad junction several locomotives one with the steam up were observed after dark A detachment led by Lieutenant Swails rushed the trains and captured them As Lieutenant Swails entered the cab of one locomotive he waved his hat in triumph This action drew the attention of the sharpshooters that he had deployed to shoot the trainmen if they tried to escape Mistaking him for a white engineer they fired at and wounded him

Second Lieutenant Swails was promoted to 1st lieutenant on 28 April 1865 and discharged on 20 August 1865 when the regiment mustered out at Boston

After the war Swails worked as an agent for the Freedmens Bureau practiced law in the South and became active in the political life of South Carolina He married Susan Aspinall a mixedrace Charlestonian who bore him three children Irene Stephen Jr and Florine Because Sarah Thompson bore him a son named Stephen Jr he had two children with that name He was the mayor of Kingstree where he lived from 1868 to 1879 He served as a state senator for ten years 18681878 including three terms as president pro tem

Swails was a delegate to the 1868 1872 and 1876 Republican national conventions He became a member of the US Electoral College and also edited a newspaper the Williamsburg Republican

He was forced out of politics after Reconstruction After a white mob tried to assassinate him he resigned from office and through his Republican connections obtained jobs in Washington DC with the US Postal Service and the United States Treasury Department

Stephen Swails is buried in the Friendly Society Cemetery Charleston South Carolina

Because of his complicated private life Stephen Swails descendants are plentiful and live in Toronto upstate New York Philadelphia and Atlanta

One of his surviving grandchilden was James Swails Sr of Rochester New York who died in 2004 His granddaughter Carolyn Janet Rollins and another grandson Robert Swails are also deceased Caroline Janet Rollins was a counselor in New Jersey She married Joseph Tyler Jefferson They have eight surviving children Robert Swails Rollins was a Doctor of Internal Medicine graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania He had two sons and a daughters and lived on Long Island New York Dr Robert Swails Rollins was a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force and after military service had a practice on Long Island New York

This card has a lot to do with someones mind and their doubts and pain The card shows a person most often a woman lying down or sitting up but they are or were sleeping When this card is reversed it can be about real or imagined doubts or pain just as dreams can be about real or imagined parts of our life Most often the person on the card is on a bridge symbolizing a person between the worlds of dreaming and reality or also the worlds of life and death

Above the person lies their fears hanging above them in an airy or dreamy way this can be represented through demons devils or even a heavily agitated night sky Often there are sharp objects such as swords or knives representing that a persons fears may pierce or stab through them The swords could also mean that they are there to help the person cut through their own difficulties

If this card is shown in an upright position it can mean deception premonitions and bad dreams suffering and depression cruelty disappointment violence loss and scandal However all of these may be overcome through faith and calculated inaction This is the card of the martyr and with it comes new life out of suffering

This card can represent being plagued by fear guilt doubt and worries that are to a large extent unfounded Chances are the person in question is dealing with a problematic situation or a difficult decision but his or her worst fear is unlikely to materialize

If the card is shown in an illdignified or reversed manner then it has a different meaning When turned this way it means distrust suspicion despair misery or malice Total isolation away from comfort and help institutionalization suicide imprisonment and isolation However in a generally positive spread the reversed meaning of this card can also indicate that the nightmare may be ending The Nine of Swords reversed can actually be a hopeful card counseling faith in the future and the promise of better days ahead

Ten of Swords is a Minor Arcana tarot card Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play tarot card games In Englishspeaking countries where the games are largely unknown tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for divinatory purposes

In the upright or positive light the ten of swords represents destruction being pinned down by a multitude of things or situations The person lying on the ground defeated and bleeding may also represent a feeling of hopelessness and being trapped by emotions or mental anguish since swords represent strife and the mind 

Dark clouds hovering above the person signify despair and a bleak situation However upon closer examination of the images in the RiderWaite card any death or destruction like all things may not be permanent There is hope in spite of the situation the golden sky in the distance suggests that the current situation is bad and things will improve

In the reversed state the card indicates a troubling situation that will continue for a significant amount of time The card suggests that the subject should not despair in difficult times to avoid ruining future prospects for success

According to Waite he is described as riding in full course as if scattering his enemies This fits well as Waite associates it among other things with war and wrath

The Knight of Swords is often taken to represent a confident and articulate young man who may act impetuously The problem is that this Knight though visionary is unrealistic He fights bravely but foolishly In some illustrations he is shown to have forgotten his armor or his helmet A rush to war is a possibility with this warrior When played reversed the Knight of Swords could represent a clever liar secrets or a sly and deceitful confidence trickster A reversed Knight of Swords is also a warning that an intended path would be a terrible mistake or more precisely that reconsidering your actions would be a wise decision

Channa Buddhist
Channa  The Divine Charioteer Pali Channa  6th century BCE in what is now Bihar and Uttar Pradesh India was a royal servant and head charioteer of Prince Siddhartha who was to become the Buddha Channa later became a disciple of the Buddha and achieved arahantship as is described in the 78th verse of the Dhammapada

Channa was a servant in the court of King uddhodana who was entrusted to attend to the needs of Siddhartha who had been lavished and pampered in a series of purposebuilt palaces in order to shield him from thoughts of pain and suffering This was done due to a prophecy by the ascetic Asita who predicted that Siddhartha would renounce the throne to become a spiritual leader were he to contemplate human suffering Channa was the servant who served as the charioteer pulled by the horse Kanthaka when Siddhartha saw the Four sights whilst meeting his subjects in the Sakya capital Kapilavastu which prompted his decision to renounce the world

During these expeditions Channa explained to Siddhartha the sights of an elderly man a sick person a dead person whose funeral was being conducted and finally an ascetic who had renounced worldly life for a spiritual one as Siddhartha who had been secluded from such sights within the palace was taken aback Channa was later entrusted by Siddhartha to accompany him upon his escape from the palace to become an ascetic whilst the remainder of the palace guards were asleep

After initially protesting and refusing to accept that Siddhartha would leave him Channa saddled Kanthaka guiding him out of the town aboard the horse to a forest by the edge of the Anoma River Channa returned Siddharthas acoutrements weapons and hair to Suddhodarnha upon his return to the palace after Siddhartha compelled him to return after Channa had refused to leave him

Upon Siddharthas enlightenment as Gautama Buddha and return to Kapilavastu Channa became a Buddhist monk joining the Sangha Due to his lone accompaniment of the Buddha on his renouncement Channa behaved in an overbearing way to the other monks and frequently criticized the two chief disciples Sariputta and Moggallana In spite of continual advice from The Buddha he continued to abuse the other monks Prior to the parinibbana the Buddha instructed Ananda to impose the brahmadanda on Channa whereby the other monks would simply ignore him After the parinibbana Channa learned of the decree and feeling remorse for his behaviour he fainted three times before asking and obtaining pardon He eventually became an arahant

<doc id="7734583" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7734583" title="Beard Liberation Front">
Beard Liberation Front
The Beard Liberation Front BLF is a British interest group which campaigns in support of beards and opposes pogonophobic discrimination against those who wear them It was founded in 1995 by socialist historian Keith Flett who continues to organise and represent the organisation Apart from its numerous campaigns in support of beards and against pogonophobia in the workplace and discrimination against those who wear beards as part of their religion it currently hosts the annual Beard of the Year award

On the face of it the campaign is semihumorous with its outwardly frivolous aims its occasionally outlandish claims of discrimination and conspiracy and its founder who is also the spokesman for the Campaign for Real Conkers However the organisation has drawn attention to more serious issues having spoken out against among other incidents the suspension of a fireman for refusing to shave off his goatee and the banning of beards among ExxonMobil oil workers in both cases employers claimed that beards interfered with breathing apparatus Flett believes that an issue of real discrimination exists against men with beards Although he admits that a beard unlike race and gender is a matter of choice he has claimed that beardism is associated with more serious forms of discrimination

The size of the organisation is unknown Flett refers to the organisation as an informal network and has claimed a few hundred supporters in the past He is the organisations sole spokesman in the media

On the occasion of its founding Keith Flett claimed that Beards are politically progressive All the great revolutionary socialists had a beard Stalin had a moustache The BLF soon took up the cause of beards in British politics In 1996 the BLF called for a bearded man to be appointed to the Cabinet According to Independent diarist Eagle Eye sources from the Labour Party then in opposition promised that if they were elected the cabinet would include the first bearded minister since Baron Passfield in 1929 Upon Labours victory in the general election a year later the bearded Robin Cook was duly appointed Foreign Secretary Since then however the BLF has regarded New Labour as obsessed with a cleanshaven image with some notable exceptions including David Blunkett and Charles Clarke

In 1998 the BLF expressed outrage at actor Sean Connery being denied a knighthood claiming that normally reliable New Labour sources had told them that the reason was his beard Connery himself claims that his knighthood was delayed because of his support for Scottish independence while others have pointed out his tax exile status and previous remarks that some complained condoned violence against women Connery was eventually knighted in 2000

In 2000 the BLF joined the anticapitalist May Day protests with a mass beard waggle decrying the waste of natural resources involved in producing shaving foam and brushes It also claimed that Robert Burns had a beard and that contemporary pictures of him which depict the Scottish poet as cleanshaven were a manufactured image designed to make him more popular to the English The Burns Federation said that there was no evidence to support Fletts claims and said that he was talking through his beard

In 2002 the BLF called for a semiboycott of the second Harry Potter film Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets citing the continued presence of obviously fake beards worn by actors Robbie Coltrane and Richard Harris Flett claimed that the Christmas season was the worst time of year for beardist taunts with the Potter movies adding to the ammunition already given by Father Christmas Acknowledging that the pressure from beardies children would be too great to consider an outright boycott he said that supporters were merely being encouraged to hiss and boo at the screen

In 2006 the BLF joined the ranks of organisations issuing health advice during the recordbreaking heat wave by advising beardwearers to trim their beards cover them with handkerchiefs and to keep them cool by placing them briefly in the freezer department of a fridge or dipping them in a pint of real ale

The BLF boycotted the 2007 World Beard and Moustache Championships as they claimed the event was over obsessive about the cutting and styling of whiskers rather than the pure cultivation of beards They were also angered by the Handlebar Club who were hosting the event because of their full club membership ban of those who possess a beard of any description Handlebar moustache wearer and satirist Michael Atters Attree who was Honorable Chairman and Master of Ceremonies of the 2007 championships and sits upon the committee of the Handlebar Club hit back at the BLF claiming that their attitude towards his Londonbased clubs handling of the WBMC was Nonsense and utter Poppycock He stated Ones personal grooming is of the utmost importance if one is to be a gentleman Often its the beard clubs that have been the WBMC hosts We are just showing the beardies how to do it properly Commenting on the Socialist aspirations of the BLF Attree stated Id rather be shot by a moustachioed fascist than bored to death by the BLF

In 2007 during the Labour leadership campaign the Beard Liberation Front held group discussions and decided to endorse Charles Clarke for the position although he eventually announced he was not standing and would be backing Gordon Brown Organiser Keith Flett was reported as saying

In June 2010 Keith Flett announced that the BLF had set the 2010 Beards and Sandals season to run from 6 June to 31 August

In 2000 Frank Dobson was named Beard 2000 amid controversy over his claim that Labour spin doctors had told him to shave off his prizewinning beard for the upcoming elections for Mayor of London Dobson said that he had told them to Stick it up their wickit

Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn who considered his beard a form of dissent against New Labour defeated Rolf Harris to win 2001s award

2002s winner was Education Secretary Charles Clarke who beat comedian Ricky Gervais and Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams for the title although Flett suggested that his beard was probably a pragmatic one to conceal multiple double chins

The 2004 Beard of the Year was held jointly by cricketer Andrew Flintoff and NATFHE union leader Paul Mackney due to the close polling between them

After the English cricket team regained the Ashes for the first time in sixteen years Andrew Flintoff won the award again in 2005 this time unshared to go with his BBC Sports Personality of the Year award and his MBE The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson came second while former jointwinner Paul Mackney was pushed into third

Englands loss of the Ashes the following year did not prevent the 2006 award going to a cricketer for the third year running this time to England spinbowler Monty Panesar who narrowly won with 30 percent of the vote Cuban President Fidel Castro was second with 29 percent Paul Mackney was again third tying with Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams with 10 percent each

Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds and Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan shared the award for Beard of the cricket World Cup 2007 with Panesar the runnerup

2012 saw the award presented to journalist and radio broadcaster Robin Lustig

Michael Eavis who organises the Glastonbury Festival was awarded Beard of the Noughties beating former Cuban leader Fidel Castro Keith Flett said Both Eavis and Castro have taken a back seat towards the end of the decade but their beards remain iconic Michael Eavis is a true hirsute icon of the Noughties and he beat Castro to the accolade by the merest whisker

In 2013 Gareth Malone won the Beard of the Year He beat John Hurt Geoff Parling and Jeremy Paxman who made it to the shortlist but fell outside the top 3 despite having one of the most discussed beards of 2013

2013 also saw the first St Davids Day Beard of Wales award which went to Adam Jones Leigh Halfpenny won in 2014 and Joe Ledley won in 2016 2015 was won jointly by brewer Toby Copestake and musician Chris Fox The latter also came second in 2016 and won outright in 2017

<doc id="7734670" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7734670" title="Remilitarization of the Rhineland">
Remilitarization of the Rhineland
The remilitarization of the Rhineland  by the German Army began on 7 March 1936 when German military forces entered the Rhineland This was significant because it violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Treaties marking the first time since the end of World War I that German troops had been in this region The remilitarization changed the balance of power in Europe from France and its allies towards Germany making it possible for Germany to pursue a policy of aggression in Western Europe that the demilitarized status of the Rhineland had blocked until then

Under Articles 42 43 and 44 of the 1919 Treaty of Versaillesimposed on Germany by the Allies after the Great WarGermany was forbidden to maintain or construct any fortification either on the Left bank of the Rhine or on the Right bank to the west of a line drawn fifty kilometers to the East of the Rhine If a violation in any manner whatsoever of this Article took place this shall be regarded as committing a hostile actand as calculated to disturb the peace of the world
The Locarno Treaties signed in October 1925 by Germany France Italy and Britain stated that the Rhineland should continue its demilitarized status permanently Locarno was regarded as important as it was a voluntary German acceptance of the Rhinelands demilitarized status as opposed to the diktat dictate of Versailles Under the terms of Locarno Britain and Italy guaranteed the FrancoGerman border and the continued demilitarized status of the Rhineland against a flagrant violation without however defining what constituted a flagrant violation Under the terms of Locarno if Germany should attempt to attack France then Britain and Italy were obliged to go to Frances aid and likewise if France should attack Germany then Britain and Italy would be obliged to Germanys aid The American historian Gerhard Weinberg called the demilitarized status of the Rhineland the single most important guarantee of peace in Europe as it made it impossible for Germany to attack its neighbors in the West and as the demilitarized zone rendered Germany defenseless in the West impossible to attack its neighbors in the East as it left Germany open to a devastating French offensive if the Reich tried to invade any of the states guaranteed by the French alliance system in Eastern Europe the socalled Cordon sanitaire

The Versailles Treaty also stipulated that Allied military forces would withdraw from the Rhineland by 1935 However the German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann announced in 1929 that Germany would not ratify the 1928 Young Plan for continuing to pay reparations unless the Allies agreed to leave the Rhineland in 1930 The British delegation at the Hague Conference on German reparations in 1929 proposed that reparations paid by Germany be reduced and that British and French forces should evacuate the Rhineland The last British soldiers left in late 1929 and the last French soldiers left in June 1930 As long as the French continued to occupy the Rhineland the Rhineland functioned as a form of collateral under which the French could respond to any German attempt at overt rearmament by annexing the Rhineland Once the last French soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930 it could no longer play its collateral role thus opening the door for German rearmament The French decision to build the Maginot Line in 1929 was a tacit French admission that it was only a matter of time before German rearmament on a massive scale would begin sometime in the 1930s and that the Rhineland was going to be remilitarized sooner or later Intelligence from the Deuxime Bureau indicated that Germany had been violating Versailles continuously all through the 1920s with the considerable help of the Soviet Union and with the French troops out of the Rhineland it could only be expected that Germany would become more open about violating Versailles The Maginot Line in its turn lessened the importance of the Rhinelands demilitarized status from a French security viewpoint

The foreign policy of Fascist Italy was to maintain an equidistant stance from all the major powers in order to exercise determinant weight which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe andor Africa 

The foreign policy goal of the Soviet Union was set forth by Joseph Stalin in a speech on 19 January 1925 that if another world war broke out between the capitalist states that We will enter the fray at the end throwing our critical weight onto the scale a weight that should prove to be decisive To promote this goal which would lead to the global triumph of Communism the Soviet Union tended to support German efforts to challenge the Versailles system by assisting German secret rearmament a policy that caused much tension with France An additional problem in FrancoSoviet relations was the Russian debt issue Before 1917 the French had been by far the largest investors in Imperial Russia and the largest buyers of Russian debt so the decision by Lenin in 1918 to repudiate all debts and to confiscate all private property whether it be owned by Russians or by foreigners had hurt the world of French business and finance quite badly The question of the Russian debt repudiation and compensation for French businesses affected by Soviet nationalisation policies poisoned FrancoSoviet relations until the early 1930s 

The centerpiece of interwar French diplomacy had been the cordon sanitaire in Eastern Europe which was intended to keep both the Soviet Union and Germany out of Eastern Europe To this end France had signed treaties of alliance with Poland in 1921 Czechoslovakia in 1924 Romania in 1926 and Yugoslavia in 1927 The cordon sanitaire states were intended as a collective replacement for Imperial Russia as Frances chief eastern ally The states of the cordon sanitaire emerged as an area of French political military economic and cultural influence 

As regards Germany it had always been assumed by the states of the cordon sanitaire that if Germany should attack any of them France would respond by beginning an offensive into western Germany Long before 1933 German military and diplomatic elites had regarded the Rhinelands demilitarized status as only temporary and planned to remilitarize the Rhineland at the first favorable diplomatic opportunity In December 1918 at a meeting of Germanys leading generals the German Army functioned as a state within the state it had decided that the chief aim would be to rebuild German military power to launch a new world war to win the world power status that the Reich had sought but failed to win in the last war All through the 1920s and the early 1930s the Reichswehr had been developing plans for a war to destroy France and its ally Poland which necessarily presumed remilitarization of the Rhineland Steps were taken by the German government to prepare for the remilitarization such as keeping former barracks in a good state of repair hiding military materials in secret depots and building customs and fire watch towers that could be easily converted into observation and machine gun posts along the frontier

From 1919 to 1932 British defense spending was based upon the Ten Year Rule which assumed that there was to be no major war for the next ten years a policy that led to the British military being cut to the bone Amongst British decisionmakers the idea of the continental commitment of sending a large army to fight on the European mainland against Germany was never explicitly rejected but was not favored The memory of the heavy losses taken in the Great War had led many to see the continental commitment of 1914 as a serious mistake For most of the interwar period the British were extremely reluctant to make security commitments in Eastern Europe regarding the region as too unstable and likely to embroil Britain in unwanted wars At most Britain was willing to make only limited security commitments in Western Europe and even then tried to avoid the continental commitment as much as possible In 1925 the British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain had famously stated in public at the Locarno conference that the Polish Corridor was not worth the bones of a single British grenadier As such Chamberlain declared that Britain would not guarantee the GermanPolish border on the grounds that the Polish Corridor should be returned to Germany That the British did not take even their Locarno commitments seriously could be seen in Whitehalls prohibition of the British military chiefs holding staff talks with German French and Italian militaries about what to do if a flagrant violation of Locarno occurred In general for most of the 1920s30s British foreign policy was based upon appeasement under which the international system established by Versailles would be revised in Germanys favor within limits in order to win German acceptance of that international order and thereby ensure the peace One of the main British aims at Locarno was to create a situation where Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully The British viewpoint was that if FrancoGerman relations improved France would gradually abandon the cordon sanitaire 

Once France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with the Reich the Poles and Czechoslovaks would be forced to adjust to German demands and would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany such as the Sudetenland the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig modern Gdask Poland British policymakers tended to exaggerate French power with the normally Francophile Sir Robert Van Vansittart the Permanent UnderSecretary at the Foreign Office writing in 1931 that Britain was faced with an unbearable French domination of Europe and what was needed was a revival of German power to counterbalance French power French economic and demographic weaknesses in the face of Germanys strengths such as the Reichs far larger population and economy together with the fact that much of France had been devastated by World War I while Germany had escaped mostly undamaged were little appreciated in Whitehall

In March 1933 the German Defence Minister General Werner von Blomberg had plans drawn up for remilitarization Blomberg starting in the fall of 1933 had a number of the paramilitary Landspolizei units in the Rhineland given secret military training and equipped with military weapons in order to prepare for remilitarization General Ludwig Becks memo of March 1935 on the need for Germany to secure Lebensraum living space in Eastern Europe had accepted that remilitarization should take place as soon it was diplomatically possible In general it was believed by German military diplomatic and political elites that it would not be possible to remiltarize before 1937

The change of regime in Germany in 1933 did cause alarm in London but there was considerable uncertainty about what Hitlers long term intentions were This uncertainty over what Hitlers ultimate intentions in foreign policy were was to color much of British policy towards Germany until 1939 British decisionmakers could never quite decide if Hitler was merely seeking the acceptable goal to the British of revising Versailles or the unacceptable goal of seeking to dominate Europe British policy towards Germany was a dualtrack policy of seeking a general settlement with the Reich in which the legitimate German complaints about the Versailles treaty would be addressed in Germanys favor while at the same time pursuing rearmament to negotiate with Germany from a position of strength to deter Hitler from choosing war as an option and in a worstcase scenario ensure that Britain was prepared if Hitler really did want to conquer Europe In February 1934 a secret report by the Defence Requirements Committee identified Germany as the ultimate potential enemy which British rearmament was to be directed against Although the possibility of German bombing attacks against British cities increased the importance of having a friendly power on the other side of the English Channel many British decisionmakers were cool if not downright hostile towards the idea of the continental commitment When British rearmament began in 1934 the Army received the lowest priority in terms of funding after the air force and the navy in part to rule out the continental commitment as an option Increasingly decisionmakers came to favor the idea of limited liability under which if the continental commitment were to be made Britain should only send the smallest possible expeditionary force to Europe and reserve its main efforts towards the war in the air and on the sea Britains refusal to make the continental commitment on the same scale as World War I caused tensions with the French who believed that it would be impossible to defeat Germany without another largescale continental commitment and deeply disliked the idea that they should do the bulk of the fighting on the land

Starting in 1934 the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou decided to put an end to any potential German aggression by building a network of alliances intended to encircle Germany and made overtures to the Soviet Union and Italy Until 1933 the Soviet Union had supported German efforts to challenge the Versailles system but the strident anticommunism of the National Socialist regime together with its claim for Lebensraum led the Soviets change positions on the question of maintaining the Versailles system In September 1933 the Soviet Union ended its secret support for German rearmament which had started in 1921 Under the guise of collective security the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov started to praise the Versailles system which until then the Soviet leaders had denounced as a capitalist plot to enslave Germany 

Starting in the 1920s Benito Mussolini had subsidized the rightwing Heimwehr Home Defense movement in Austria and after the ultraconservative Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss had seized dictatorial power in March 1933 Austria had fallen within the Italian sphere of influence The terrorist campaign mounted by Austrian Nazis with the open support of Germany against the Dollfuss regime with the aim of overthrowing Dollfuss to achieve an Anschluss caused considerable tensions between Rome and Berlin Mussolini had warned Hitler several times that Austria was within the Italian sphere of influence not the German and to cease trying to overthrow his protg Dollfuss On 25 July 1934 there had occurred the July Putsch in Vienna that saw Dollfuss assassinated by the Austrian SS and an announcement by the Austrian Nazis that the Anschluss was at hand At the same time that Austrian Nazis attempted to seize power all over Austria the SS Austrian Legion based in Bavaria began to attack frontier posts along the GermanAustrian border in what looked like the beginning of an invasion In response Mussolini had mobilized the Italian Army concentrated several divisions at the Brenner Pass and warned Hitler that Italy would go to war with Germany if he tried to follow up the putsch by invading Austria The Austrianborn Hitler although deeply offended by Mussolinis blunt assertions that his birthplace was within the sphere of influence of any power other than Germany nevertheless realized he was in no position to do anything except to beat a humiliating retreat To his disgust the German Fuhrer had to disallow the Putsch he had ordered and not follow it up by invading Austria while the Austrian government crushed the Putsch by the Austrian Nazis 

After Barthou was assassinated on 9 October 1934 his work in trying to build antiGerman alliances with the Soviet Union and Italy was continued by Pierre Laval On 7 January 1935 during a summit in Rome Laval essentially told Mussolini that he had a free hand in the Horn of Africa and France would not oppose an Italian invasion of Ethiopia On 14 April 1935 Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald of Great Britain Premier Pierre Laval of France and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini met in Stresa to form the Stresa Front to oppose any further German violations of Versailles following the German statement in March 1935 that Germany would no longer abide by Parts V or VI of the Treaty of Versailles In the spring of 1935 joint staff talks had begun between France and Italy with the aim of forming an antiGerman military alliance On 2 May 1935 Laval travelled to Moscow where he a signed a treaty of alliance with Soviet Union At once the German government began a violent press campaign against the FrancoSoviet pact claiming it was a violation of Locarno that was an immense danger for the Reich

In his peace speech of May 21 1935 Adolf Hitler stated In particular they the Germans will uphold and fulfill all obligations arising out of the Locarno Treaty so long as the other parties are on their side ready to stand by that pact That line in Hitlers speech was written by his foreign minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath who wished to reassure foreign leaders who felt threatened by Germanys denunciation in March 1935 of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles which had disarmed Germany At the same time Neurath wanted to provide an opening for the eventual remilitarization of the Rhineland hence the conditional hedging of the promise to obey Locarno only as long as other powers did Hitler always took the line that Germany did not consider itself bound by the Diktat of Versailles but that Germany would respect any treaty that it willingly signed such as Locarno under which Germany had promised to keep the Rhineland demilitarized forever hence Hitler always promised during his peace speeches to obey Locarno as opposed to Versailles

On 7 June 1935 MacDonald resigned as British Prime Minister due to ailing health and was replaced by Stanley Baldwin of the Conservative Party the leadership change did not affect British foreign policy in any meaningful way On October 3 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia and thus began the Abyssinia Crisis Under strong pressure from a British public opinion which was very much in favor of collective security the British government took the lead in pressing the League of Nations for sanctions against Italy The decision of the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to take a strong line in favor of collective security was mostly motivated by domestic politics Having just won an election on 14 November 1935 on the platform of upholding collective security the Baldwin government pressed very strongly for sanctions against Italy for invading Ethiopia The League Assembly voted for a British motion to impose sanctions on Italy with immediate effect on 18 November 1935

The British line that collective security must be upheld with regard to Ethiopia caused considerable tensions between Paris and London with the French taking the viewpoint that Hitler not Mussolini was the real danger to the peace and that if the price of continuing Stresa Front was accepting the conquest of Ethiopia it was worth paying The British historian Correlli Barnett wrote for Laval all that really mattered was Nazi Germany His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees To estrange Italy one of the Locarno powers over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Lavals Auvergnat peasant mind With Paris and London openly at loggerheads over the correct response to Italian invasion of Ethiopia to say nothing of the very public rift between Rome and London an opening was seen in Germany for remilitarization of the Rhineland The AngloItalian dispute placed the French in an uncomfortable position On one hand Britains repeated refusal to make the continental commitment increased the value to the French of Italy as the only other nation in Western Europe capable of fielding a large army against Germany But on the other hand the British economy was far larger than the Italian economy which thus meant from the longterm French perspective Britain was a much better ally as Britain had vastly more economic staying power than Italy for what was assumed would be another guerre de la longue dure war of the long duration ie a long war against Germany The American historian Zach Shore wrote that French leaders found themselves in the awkward position of seeking the military cooperation of two incompatible allies Since Italy and Britain had clashing interests in the Mediterranean France could not ally with one without alienating the other To avoid a total rupture with Britain France did not use its veto power as a member of the League Council and instead voted for the sanctions But Laval did use the threat of a French veto to water down the sanctions and to have such items such as oil and coal which might have crippled Italy removed from the sanctions list Nonetheless Mussolini felt betrayed by his French friends and next to Britain France was the nation that he was most angry with for the sanctions Despite all of Mussolinis outrage about the sanctions they were largely ineffective The United States and Germanyboth of which were not members of the Leaguechose not to abide by the sanctions and as result American and German businesses supplied Italy with all of the goods that League had placed on the sanctions list making the sanctions more of an annoyance than a problem for the Italians

Italian cryptographers had broken the British naval and diplomatic codes in the early 1930s consequently Mussolini knew very well that although Britain might threaten war through such moves like reinforcing the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1935 the British had already decided in advance that they would never go to war for Ethiopia Armed with this knowledge Mussolini felt free to engage in all sorts of wild threats of war against Britain from late 1935 onwards declaring at one point that he rather see the entire world go up in a blaze than stop his invasion of Ethiopia Mussolinis frequent threats to destroy the British Empire if the British continued to oppose his Ethiopian war had created the impression in late 1935early 1936 that Britain and Italy were on the verge of war

In late 1935 Neurath started rumours that Germany was considering remilitarizing the Rhineland in response to the FrancoSoviet pact of May 1935 which Neurath insisted was a violation of Locarno that menaced Germany At the same time Neurath ordered German diplomats to start drawing up legal briefs justifying remilitarization of the Rhineland under the grounds that the FrancoSoviet pact violated Locarno In doing so Neurath was acting without orders from Hitler but in the expectation that time was ripe for remilitarization due to the crisis in AngloItalian relations caused by the ItaloEthiopian War To resolve the Abyssinia Crisis Robert Vansittart the Permanent Undersecretary at the British Foreign Office proposed to the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare what came to be known as the HoareLaval plan under which half of Ethiopia would be given to Italy with the rest nominally independent under the Emperor Haile Selassie Vansittart who was a passionate Francophile and an equally ardent Germanophobe saw Germany as the real danger and wanted to sacrifice Ethiopia for the sake of maintaining the Stresa Front Vansittart had a powerful ally in Hankey a proponent of realpolitik who saw the entire idea of imposing sanctions on Italy as so much folly Persuaded of the merits of Vansittarts approach Hoare travelled to Paris to meet with Laval who agreed to the plan However Alexis St Leger the General Secretary at the Quai dOrsaywho unusually amongst the generally proItalian French officials happened to have a visceral dislike of Fascist Italyand he decided to sabotage the HoareLaval plan by leaking it to the French press St Leger was by all accounts a rather strange character who sometimes chose to undercut policy initiatives that he disapproved of In a strange asymmetry the Francophile Vansittart at the Foreign Office was in favor the French approach that it was worth letting Italy conquer Ethiopia in order to continue the Stresa Front whereas the Anglophile St Leger at the Quai dOrsay was in favor of the British approach of upholding collective security even at the risk of damaging the Stresa Front When the news of the HoareLaval plan to essentially reward Mussolini reached Britain it caused such an uproar that Hoare had to resign in disgrace to be replaced by Anthony Eden and the newly elected Baldwin government was almost toppled by a backbenchers revolt Baldwin lied to the House of Commons by claiming quite falsely that the cabinet was unaware of the HoareLaval plan and that Hoare was a rogue minister acting on his own In France public opinion was just as outraged by the HoareLaval plan as British public opinion was Lavals policy of internal devaluation of forcing deflation on the French economy in order to increase French exports to combat the Great Depression had already made him extremely unpopular and the HoareLaval plan further damaged his reputation The Chamber of Deputies debated the plan on 27 and 28 December the Popular Front condemned it with Lon Blum telling Laval You have tried to give and to keep You wanted to have your cake and eat it You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words You have debased everything by fixing intrigue and slickness  Not sensitive enough to the importance of great moral issues you have reduced everything to the level of your petty methods 

Mussolini for his part rejected the HoareLaval plan saying he wanted to subject all of Ethiopia not just half Following the fiasco of the HoareLaval plan the British government resumed its previous policy of imposing sanctions against Italy in a halfhearted way which in turn imposed serious strains on relations with both Paris and especially Rome Given the provocative Italian attitude Britain wanted to begin staff talks with France for a possible war with Italy On 13 December 1935 Neurath told the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps that Berlin regarded any AngloFrench staff talks without Germany  even if directed only against Italy  as a violation of Locarno that would force Germany to remilitarize the Rhineland Through ItaloGerman relations were quite unfriendly in 1935 Germany had been an outspoken supporter of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and offered Mussolini a benevolent neutrality Under the banner of white supremacy and fascism Hitler came out strongly for the Italian invasion and he made a point of shipping the Italians various raw materials and weapons which the League of Nations sanctions had forbidden Italy Hitlers support for the Italian aggression won him much goodwill in Rome By contrast Lavals proItalian intrigues and his efforts to sabotage the Britishled effort to impose sanctions on Italy created a lasting climate of distrust between the British and the French

The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden anticipated that by 1940 Germany might be persuaded to return to the League of Nations accept arms limitations and renounce her territorial claims in Europe in exchange for remilitarization of the Rhineland return of the former German African colonies and German economic priority along the Danube The Foreign Offices Ralph Wigram advised that Germany should be permitted to remilitarise the Rhineland in exchange for an air pact outlawing bombing and a German promise not to use force to change their borders However Wigram did not succeed in convincing his colleagues or cabinet ministers Edens goal has been defined as that of a general settlement which sought a return to the normality of the twenties and the creation of conditions in which Hitler could behave like Stresemann Gustav Stresemann German chancellor foreign minister and democrat during the Weimar Republic On 16 January 1936 the French Premier Pierre Laval submitted the FrancoSoviet Pact to the Chamber of Deputies for ratification In January 1936 during his visit to London to attend the funeral of King George V Neurath told Eden If however the other signatories or guarantors of the Locarno Pact should conclude bilateral agreements contrary to the spirit of Locarno Pact we should be compelled to reconsider our attitude Edens response to Neuraths veiled threat that Germany would remilitarize the Rhineland if the French National Assembly ratified the FrancoSoviet pact convinced Neurath that if Germany remilitarized then Britain would take Germanys side against France There was a clause in the Locarno treaty calling for binding international arbitration if the one of the signatory powers signed a treaty that the other powers considered to be incompatible with Locarno Both Neurath and his State Secretary Prince Bernhard von Blow professed to every foreign diplomat with whom they spoke that the FrancoSoviet Pact was a violation of Locarno but at the same time both strongly advised Hitler not to seek international arbitration in order to determine whether the FrancoSoviet pact really was a violation of Locarno Seeking international arbitration was a loselose situation for Germany on the one hand if it were ruled that the FrancoSoviet pact was incompatible with Locarno then the French would have to abandon the pact thereby depriving Germany of an excuse to remilitarize on the other hand if it were ruled that FrancoSoviet pact was compatible with Locarno Germany would likewise have no excuse for remilitarization Although Neurath indicated several times in press conferences in early 1936 that Germany was planning on using the arbitration clause in Locarno in order to help convince public opinion abroad that the FrancoSoviet pact was a violation of Locarno the German government never invoked the arbitration clause

At the same time Neurath received an intelligence report on 10 January 1936 from Gottfried Aschmann the Chief of the Auswrtiges Amts Press Division who during a visit to Paris in early January 1936 had talked to a minor French politician named Jean Montiny who was a close friend of Premier Laval who had frankly mentioned that Frances economic problems had retarded French military modernization and that France would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland  Neurath did not pass on Aschmanns report to Hitler but he placed a high value upon it Neurath was seeking to improve his position within the Nazi regime by repeatedly assuring Hitler during the Rhineland crisis that the French would do nothing without telling Hitler the source of his selfassurance Neurath came across as a diplomat blessed with an uncanny intuition something that improved his standing with Hitler Traditionally in Germany the conduct of foreign policy had been the work of the Auswrtiges Amt Foreign Office but starting in 1933 Neurath had been faced with the threat of Nazi interlopers in diplomacy as various NSDAP agencies started to conduct their own foreign policies independent of and often against the Auswrtiges Amt The most serious of the interlopers in diplomacy was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop a sort of alternative foreign ministry loosely linked to the NSDAP headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop which aggressively sought to undercut the work of the Auswrtiges Amt at every turn Further exacerbating the rivalry between the Dienststelle Ribbentrop and the Auswrtiges Amt was the fact that Neurath and Ribbentrop utterly hated one another with Ribbentrop making no secret of his belief that he would be a much better foreign minister than Neurath whereas Neurath viewed Ribbentrop as a hopelessly inept amateur diplomat meddling in matters that did not concern him 

During January 1936 the German Chancellor and Fhrer Adolf Hitler decided to reoccupy the Rhineland Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937 but chose in early 1936 to move remilitarization forward by a year for several reasons namely the ratification by the French National Assembly of the FrancoSoviet pact of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against FrancoSoviet encirclement the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937 the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regimes popularity the ItaloEthiopian War which had set Britain against Italy had effectively broken up the Stresa Front and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year In his biography of Hitler the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitlers preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks and Hitlers need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 193536

During a meeting between Prince Bernhard von Blow the State Secretary at the Auswrtiges Amt who is not to be confused with his more famous uncle Chancellor Bernhard von Blow and the French Ambassador Andr FranoisPoncet on 13 January 1936 where Blow handed FranoisPoncet yet another note protesting against the FrancoSoviet pact FranoisPoncet accused Blow to his face of seeking any excuse no matter how bizarre strange or implausible to send troops back into the Rhineland On 15 January 1936 a topsecret NKVD report was sent to Joseph Stalin entitled Summary of Military and Political Intelligence on Germany which reported  based on statements from various diplomats in the Auswrtiges Amt  that Germany was planning on remilitarizing the Rhineland in the nearfuture The same summary quoted Blow as saying that if Britain and France made any sort of agreement concerning military cooperation that did not involve Germany We would view this as a violation of Locarno and if we are not dragged into participating in negotiations we will not consider ourselves bound by Locarno obligations concerning the preservation of the Rhine demilitarized zone The Soviet report warning of German plans for remilitarization was not passed on to either the British or French governments

On 17 January 1936 Benito Mussolini  who was angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against Ethiopia  told the German Ambassador in Rome Ulrich von Hassell that he wanted to see an AustroGerman agreement which would in practice bring Austria into Germanys wake so that she could pursue no other foreign policy than one parallel with Germany If Austria as a formally independent state were thus in practice to become a German satellite he would have no objection 

By recognizing that Austria was within the German sphere of influence Mussolini had removed the principal problem in ItaloGerman relations ItaloGerman relations had been quite bad since mid1933 and especially since the July Putsch of 1934 so Mussolinis remarks to Hassell in early 1936 indicating that he wanted a rapprochement with Germany were considered extremely significant in Berlin In another meeting Mussolini told Hassell that he regarded the Stresa Front of 1935 as dead and that Italy would do nothing to uphold Locarno should Germany violate it Initially German officials did not believe in Mussolinis desire for a rapprochement but after Hitler sent Hans Frank on a secret visit to Rome carrying a message from the Fhrer about Germanys support for Italys actions in the conquest of Ethiopia ItaloGerman relations improved markedly On 24 January the very unpopular Laval resigned as premier rather than be defeated on a motion of noconfidence in the National Assembly as the Radical Socialists decided to join the leftwing Popular Front thereby ensuring an antiLaval majority in the Chamber of Deputies A caretaker government was formed in Paris led by Albert Sarraut until new elections could be held The Sarraut cabinet was a mixture of men of the right like Georges Mandel the center like Georges Bonnet and the left like Joseph PaulBoncour which made it almost impossible for the cabinet to make decisions Immediately the Sarraut government came into conflict with Britain as Eden started to press the League for oil sanctions against Italy something that the French were completely opposed to and threatened to veto

On 11 February 1936 the new French Premier Albert Sarraut affirmed that his government would work for the ratification of the FrancoSoviet pact On February 12 1936 Hitler met with Neurath and his AmbassadoratLarge Joachim von Ribbentrop to ask their opinion of the likely foreign reaction to remilitarization Neurath supported remiltarization but argued that Germany should negotiate more before doing so whereas Ribbentrop argued for unilateral remilitarization at once Ribbentrop told Hitler that if France went to war in response to German remiltarization then Britain would go to war with France an assessment of the situation with which Neurath did not agree but one that encouraged Hitler to proceed with remiltarization

On the 12th of February Hitler informed his War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg of his intentions and asked the head of the Army General Werner von Fritsch how long it would take to transport a few infantry battalions and an artillery battery into the Rhineland Fritsch answered that it would take three days organization but he was in favour of negotiation as he believed that the German Army was in no state for armed combat with the French Army The Chief of the General Staff General Ludwig Beck warned Hitler that the German Army would be unable to successfully defend Germany against a possible retaliatory French attack Hitler reassured Fritsch that he would withdraw his forces if there were a French countermove Weinberg wrote thatGerman military plans provided for small German units to move into the Rhineland joining the local militarized police Landespolizei and staging a fighting withdrawal if there were a military counteraction from the West The story that the Germans had orders to withdraw if France moved against them is partially correct but essentially misleading the withdrawal was to be a tactical defensive move not a return to the earlier position The possibility of a war was thus accepted by Hitler but he clearly did not think the contingency very likely The operation was codenamed Winter Exercise 

Unknown to Hitler on 14 February Eden had written to the Quai dOrsay stating that Britain and France should enter betimes into negotiationsfor the surrender on conditions of our rights in the zone while such surrender still has got a bargaining value Eden wrote to the British cabinet that the end of the demilitarized zone would not merely change local military values but is likely to lead to farreaching political repercussions of a kind which will further weaken Frances influence in Central and Eastern Europe In February 1936 the Deuxime Bureau started to submit reports suggesting that Germany was planning on sending troops into the Rhineland in the very nearfuture Because FranoisPoncets reports from Berlin indicated that the German economic situation was quite precarious it was felt in Paris that sanctions against Germany could be quite devastating and might even lead to the collapse of the Nazi regime

Along with Ribbentrop and Neurath Hitler discussed the planned remilitarization in detail with War Minister General Werner von Blomberg Chief of General Staff General Ludwig Beck Hermann Gring Army CommanderinChief General Werner von Fritsch and Ulrich von Hassell Ribbentrop and Blomberg were in favor Beck and Fritsch were opposed and Neurath and Hassell were supportive but argued that there was no real need to act now as quiet diplomacy would soon ensure remilitarization That Hitler was in close and regular contact with Hassell the ambassador to Italy all through February and early March showed how much importance Hitler attached to Italy Of the three leaders of the Stresa front Mussolini was easily the one Hitler most respected and so Hitler viewed Italy as the key taking the view that if Mussolini decided to oppose the remilitarization then Britain and France would follow Not withstanding Mussolinis remarks in January Hitler was still not convinced of Italian support and ordered Hassell to find out Mussolinis attitude On 22 February Hassell wrote in his diary that the pending ratification of the FrancoSoviet pact was just a pretext writing it was quite clear that he Hitler really wanted the ratification to use as a platform for his action That same day Hassell held a meeting with Mussolini where Il Duce stated if oil sanctions were applied against Italy he would make Locarno disappear of its own accord and that anyhow Italy would not act if German troops were to enter the Rhineland 

At the same time Neurath started preparing elaborate documents justifying remilitarization as a response forced on Germany by the FrancoSoviet pact and advised Hitler to keep the number of troops sent into the Rhineland very small so to allow the Germans to claim that they had not committed a flagrant violation of Locarno both Britain and Italy were only committed to offering a military response to a flagrant violation In the statement justifying remilitarization that Neurath prepared for the foreign press the German move was portrayed as something forced on a reluctant Germany by ratification of the FrancoSoviet pact and strongly hinted that Germany would return to the League of Nations if remilitarization was accepted After meeting with Hitler on 18 February Baron von Neurath expressed the viewpoint for Hitler in the first instance domestic motives were decisive

At the same time that Frank was visiting Rome Gring had been dispatched to Warsaw to meet the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Jzef Beck and to ask the Poles to remain neutral if France decided on war in response to the remilitarization of the Rhineland Colonel Beck believed that the French would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland and thus could assure those in the Polish government who wished for Poland to stay close to its traditional ally France that Poland would act if France did while at the same time telling Gring that he wanted closer GermanPolish relations and would do nothing in the event of remilitarization

On 13 February 1936 during a meeting with Prince Bismarck of the German Embassy in London Ralph Wigram the head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office stated that the British government whose Prime Minister from 1935 to 1937 was Stanley Baldwin wanted a working agreement on an air pact that would outlaw bombing and that Britain would consider revising Versailles and Locarno in Germanys favor for an air pact Prince Bismarck reported to Berlin that Wigram had hinted quite strongly that the things that Britain were willing to consider revising included remilitarization On 22 February 1936 Mussolini who was still angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against Ethiopia told von Hassell that Italy would not honour Locarno if Germany were to remilitarize the Rhineland Even if Mussolini had wanted to honour Locarno practical problems would have arisen as the bulk of the Italian Army was at that time engaged in the conquest of Ethiopia and as there is no common ItaloGerman frontier

Historians debate the relation between Hitlers decision to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1936 and his broad longterm goals Those historians who favour an intentionist interpretation of German foreign policy such as Klaus Hildebrand and the late Andreas Hillgruber see the Rhineland remilitarization as only one stage of Hitlers stufenplan stage by stage plan for world conquest Those historians who take a functionist interpretation see the Rhineland remilitarization more as ad hoc improvised response on the part of Hitler to the economic crisis of 1936 as a cheap and easy way of restoring the regimes popularity The British Marxist historian Timothy Mason famously argued that Hitlers foreign policy was driven by domestic needs related to a failing economy and that it was economic problems at home as opposed to Hitlers will or intentions that drove Nazi foreign policy from 1936 onwards which ultimately degenerated into a barbaric variant of social imperialism which led to a flight into war in 1939 

As Hildebrand himself has noted these interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive Hildebrand has argued that although Hitler did have a programme for world domination the way in which Hitler attempted to execute his programme was highly improvised and much subject to structural factors both on the international stage and domestically that were often not under Hitlers control On February 26 the French National Assembly ratified the FrancoSoviet pact On February 27 Hitler had lunch with Hermann Gring and Joseph Goebbels to discuss the planned remilitarization with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards Still somewhat too early On February 29 an interview Hitler had on February 21 with the French fascist and journalist Bertrand de Jouvenel was published in the newspaper ParisMidi During his interview with a clearly admiring de Jouvenel Hitler professed himself a man of peace who desperately wanted friendship with France and blamed all of the problems in FrancoGerman relations on the French who for some strange reason were trying to encircle Germany via the FrancoSoviet pact despite the evident fact that the Fuhrer was not seeking to threaten France Hitlers interview with de Jouvenel was intended to influence French public opinion into believing that it was their government that was responsible for the remilitarization Only on March 1 did Hitler finally make up his mind to proceed A further factor in Hitlers decision was that the sanctions committee of the League was due to start discussing possible oil sanctions against Italy on 2 March something that was likely to lead the diplomats of Europe to be focused on the Abyssinia Crisis at the expense of everything else

Not long after dawn on March 7 1936 nineteen German infantry battalions and a handful of planes entered the Rhineland By doing so Germany violated Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty of Locarno They reached the river Rhine by 1100am and then three battalions crossed to the west bank of the Rhine At the same time Baron von Neurath summoned the Italian ambassador Baron Bernardo Attolico the British ambassador Sir Eric Phipps and the French ambassador Andr FranoisPoncet to the Wilhelmstrasse to hand them notes accusing France of violating Locarno by ratifying the FrancoSoviet pact and announcing that as such Germany had decided to renounce Locarno and remilitarize the Rhineland

When German reconnaissance learned that thousands of French soldiers were congregating on the FrancoGerman border General Blomberg begged Hitler to evacuate the German forces Under Blombergs influence Hitler nearly ordered the German troops to withdraw but was then persuaded by the resolutely calm Neurath to continue with Operation Winter Exercise Following Neuraths advice Hitler inquired whether the French forces had actually crossed the border and when informed that they had not he assured Blomberg that Germany would wait until this happened In marked contrast to Blomberg who was highly nervous during Operation Winter Exercise Neurath stayed calm and very much urged Hitler to stay the course

The Rhineland coup is often seen as the moment when Hitler could have been stopped with very little effort the German forces involved in the move were small compared to the much larger and at the time more powerful French military The American journalist William L Shirer wrote if the French had marched into the Rhineland

A German officer assigned to the Bendlerstrasse during the crisis told H R Knickerbocker during the Spanish Civil War I can tell you that for five days and five nights not one of us closed an eye We knew that if the French marched we were done We had no fortifications and no army to match the French If the French had even mobilized we should have been compelled to retire The general staff the officer said considered Hitlers action suicidal General Heinz Guderian a German general interviewed by French officers after the Second World War claimed If you French had intervened in the Rhineland in 1936 we should have been sunk and Hitler would have fallen

That Hitler faced serious opposition gains apparent weight from the fact that Ludwig Beck and Werner von Fritsch did indeed become opponents of Hitler but according to the American historian Ernest May there is not a scrap of evidence for this at this stage May wrote that the German Army officer corps was all for remilitarizing the Rhineland and only the question of timing of such a move divided them from Hitler May further noted that there is no evidence that the German Army was planning on overthrowing Hitler if he had been forced to order a withdraw from the Rhineland and the fact that Mussolini utterly humiliated Hitler during the July Putsch in 1934 by forcing Germany to climbdown on Austria without leading to the slightest effort on the part of the Reichswehr to overthrow Hitler must cast further doubt on the thesis that Hitler would have been toppled if only he been forced to withdraw from the Rhineland

Writing about relations between Hitler and his generals in early 1936 the American historian JT Emerson declared In fact at no time during the twelveyear existence of the Third Reich did Hitler enjoy more amicable relations with his generals than in 1935 and 1936 During these years there was nothing like an organized military resistance to party politics Later on in World War II despite the increasing desperate situation of Germany from 1942 onwards and a whole series of humiliating defeats the overwhelming majority of the Wehrmacht stayed loyal to the Nazi regime and continued to fight hard for that regime right up to its destruction in 1945 the only exception being the putsch of July 20 1944 in which only a minority of the Wehrmacht rebelled while the majority remained loyal The willingness of the Wehrmacht to continue to fight and die hard for the National Socialist regime despite the fact Germany was clearly losing the war from 1943 onwards reflected the deep commitment of most of the Wehrmacht to National Socialism

Furthermore the senior officers of the Wehrmacht were deeply corrupt men who received huge bribes from Hitler in exchange for their loyalty In 1933 Hitler had created a slush fund known as Konto 5 run by Hans Lammers which provided bribes to senior officers and civil servants in exchange for their loyalty to the National Socialist regime Given the intense devotion of the Wehrmacht to the National Socialist regime and its corrupt senior officers who never got quite enough in the way of bribes from Hitler it is very unlikely that the Wehrmacht would have turned on their Fuhrer if the Wehrmacht were forced out of the Rhineland in 1936

On 7 March 1936 Hitler announced before the Reichstag that the Rhineland had been remilitarized and to blunt the danger of war Hitler offered to return to the League of Nations to sign an air pact to outlaw bombing as a way of war and a nonaggression pact with France if the other powers agreed to accept the remilitarization In his address to the Reichstag Hitler began with a lengthy denunciation of the Treaty of Versailles as unfair to Germany claimed that he was a man of peace who wanted war with noone and argued that he was only seeking equality for Germany by peacefully overturning the unfair Treaty of Versailles Hitler claimed that it was unfair that because of Versailles a part of Germany should be demilitarized whereas in every other nation of the world a government could order its troops to anywhere within its borders and claimed all he wanted was equality for Germany Even then Hitler claimed that he would have been willing to accept the continued demilitarization of the Rhineland as Stresemann had promised at Locarno in 1925 as the price for peace had it not been for the FrancoSoviet Pact of 1935 which he maintained was threatening to Germany and had left him with no other choice than to remilitarize the Rhineland With his eye on public opinion abroad Hitler made a point of stressing that the remilitarization was not intended to threaten anyone else but was instead only a defensive measure imposed on Germany by what he claimed were the menacing actions of France and the Soviet Union At least some people abroad accepted Hitlers claim that he been forced to take this step because of the FrancoSoviet pact Former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George stated in the House of Commons that Hitlers actions in the wake of the FrancoSoviet pact were fully justified and he would have been a traitor to Germany if he had not protected his country

When German troops marched into Cologne a vast cheering crowd formed spontaneously to greet the soldiers throwing flowers onto the Wehrmacht while Catholic priests offered to bless the soldiers Cardinal Karl Joseph Schulte of Cologne held a Mass at Cologne Cathedral to celebrate and thank Hitler for sending back our army In Germany the news that the Rhineland had been remilitarized was greeted with wild celebrations all over the country the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote of March 1936 that People were besides themselves with delight  It was almost impossible not to be caught up in the infectious mood of joy Not until the victory over France in June 1940 was the Nazi regime to be as popular as it was in March 1936 Reports to the Sopade in the spring of 1936 mentioned that a great many erstwhile Social Democrats and opponents of the Nazis amongst the working class had nothing but approval of the remilitarization and that many who had once been opposed to the Nazis under the Weimar Republic were now beginning to support them 

To capitalize on the vast popularity of the remilitarization Hitler called a referendum on 29 March 1936 in which the majority of German voters expressed their approval of the remilitarization During his campaign stops to ask for a yes vote Hitler was greeted with huge crowds roaring their approval of his defiance of Versailles Kershaw wrote that the 99 ja yes vote in the referendum was improbably high but it is clear that an overwhelming majority of voters did genuinely chose to vote yes when asked if they approved of the remilitarization The American journalist William L Shirer wrote about the 1936 election Nevertheless this observer who covered the election from one corner of the Reich to the other has no doubt that the vote of approval for Hitlers coup was overwhelming And why not The junking of Versailles and the appearance of German soldiers marching again into what was after all German territory were things that almost all Germans naturally approved of The No vote was given as 540 211 In the aftermath of the remilitarization the economic crisis which had so damaged the National Socialist regimes popularity was forgotten by almost all After the Rhineland triumph Hitlers selfconfidence surged to new heights and those who knew him well stated that after March 1936 there was a real psychological change as Hitler was utterly convinced of his infallibility in a way that he not been before

Historians writing without benefit of access to the French archives which were not opened until the mid1970s such as William L Shirer in his books The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich 1960 and The Collapse of the Third Republic 1969 have claimed that France although possessing at this time superior armed forces compared to Germany including after a possible mobilization 100 infantry divisions was psychologically unprepared to use force against Germany Shirer quoted the figure of France having 100 divisions compared to Germanys 19 battalions in the Rhineland Frances actions during the Rhineland crisis have often used as support of the dcadence thesis that during the interwar period the supposed decadence of the French way of life caused the French people to degenerate physically and morally to the point that the French were simply unable to stand up to Hitler and the French in some way had it coming when they were defeated in 1940 Shirer wrote that the French could have easily turned back the German battalions in the Rhineland had the French people not been sinking into defeatism in 1936 Historians such as the American historian Stephen A Schuker who have examined the relevant French primary sources have rejected Shirers claims finding that a major paralyzing factor on French policy was the economic situation Frances top military official General Maurice Gamelin informed the French government that the only way to remove the Germans from the Rhineland was to mobilize the French Army which would not only be unpopular it would also cost the French treasury 30 million francs per day Gamelin assumed a worstcase scenario in which a French move into the Rhineland would spark an allout FrancoGerman war a case which required full mobilization Gamelins analysis was supported by the War Minister General Louis Maurin who told the Cabinet that it was inconceivable that France could reverse the German remilitarization without full mobilization This was especially the case as the Deuxime Bureau had seriously exaggerated the number of German troops in the Rhineland sending in a report to the French cabinet estimating that there were 295000 German troops in the Rhineland The Deuxime Bureau had come up with this estimate by counting all of the SS SA and Landespolizei formations in the Rhineland as regular troops and so the French believed only by full mobilization would France have enough troops to expel the alleged 295000 German troops from the Rhineland The real number was actually 3000 German soldiers The French historian JeanBaptiste Duroselle accused Gamelin of distorting what the Deuxime Bureaus intelligence in his report to the cabinet by converting the SS SA and Landespolizei units into fully trained troops to provide a reason for inaction Neuraths truthful statement that Germany had only sent 19 battalions into the Rhineland was dismissed by Gamelin as a ruse to allow Germans to claim that they had not committed a flagrant violation of Locarno in order to avoid having Locarno invoked against Germany and that Hitler would never risk a war by sending such a small force into the Rhineland 
At the same time in late 1935early 1936 France was gripped by a financial crisis with the French Treasury informing the government that sufficient cash reserves to maintain the value of the franc as currently pegged by the gold standard in regard to the US dollar and the British pound no longer existed and only a huge foreign loan on the money markets of London and New York could prevent the value of the franc from experiencing a disastrous downfall Because France was on the verge of elections scheduled for the spring of 1936 devaluation of the franc which was viewed as abhorrent by large sections of French public opinion was rejected by the caretaker government of Premier Albert Sarraut as politically unacceptable Investor fears of a war with Germany were not conducive to raising the necessary loans to stabilize the franc the German remilitarization of the Rhineland by sparking fears of war worsened the French economic crisis by causing a massive cash flow out of France as worried investors shifted their savings towards what were felt to be safer foreign markets The fact that France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 understandably led most investors to conclude if France should be involved in another war with Germany the French would default again on their debts On March 18 1936 Wilfrid Baumgartner the director of the Mouvement gnral des fonds the French equivalent of a permanent undersecretary reported to the government that France for all intents and purposes was bankrupt Only by desperate armtwisting from the major French financial institutions did Baumgartner manage to obtain enough in the way of shortterm loans to prevent France from defaulting on her debts and keeping the value of the franc from sliding too far in March 1936 Given the financial crisis the French government feared that there were insufficient funds to cover the costs of mobilization and that a fullblown war scare caused by mobilization would only exacerbate the financial crisis The American historian Zach Shore wrote that It was not lack of French will to fight in 1936 which permitted Hitlers coup but rather Frances lack of funds military might and therefore operational plans to counter German remilitarization

An additional issue for the French was the state of the Arme de lAir The Deuxime Bureau reported that not only had the Luftwaffe developed considerably more advanced aircraft than what France possessed but owing to the superior productivity of German industry and the considerably larger size of the German economy the Luftwaffe had a three to one advantage in fighters Problems with productivity within the French aircraft industry meant the French air force would have a great deal of trouble replacing their losses in the event of combat with the Luftwaffe Thus it was believed by the French military elite that should war come then the Luftwaffe would dominate the skies and not only attack French troops marching into the Rhineland but bomb French cities Yet another problem for the French were the attitudes of the states of the cordon sanitaire Since 1919 it had accepted that France needed the alliance system in Eastern Europe to provide additional manpower Germanys population was one and half times the size of Frances and to open up an eastern front against the Reich Without the states of the cordon sanitaire it was believed impossible for France to defeat Germany Only Czechoslovakia indicated firmly that it would go to war with Germany if France marched into the Rhineland while Poland Romania and Yugoslavia all indicated that they would only to go to war if German soldiers entered France French public opinion and newspapers were very hostile towards the German coup but few called for war The majority of the French newspapers called for League of Nations sanctions to be imposed on the Reich to inflict such economically crippling costs as to force the German Army out of the Rhineland and for France to build new and reinforce the existing alliances with the aim of preventing further German challenges to the international status quo One of the few newspapers to support Germany was the royalist LAction Franaise which ran a banner headline reading The Republic Has Assassinated the Peace and went on to say that the German move was justified by the FrancoSoviet pact On the other ideological extreme the Communists issued a statement calling for national unity against those who would lead us to carnage who were the Laval clique who were allegedly pushing for a war with Germany because war was supposedly good for capitalism

Upon hearing of the German move the French government issued a statement strongly hinting that military action was a possible option From 930 am until noon on 7 March a meeting of the French cabinet took place to discuss what to do which ended with the conclusion that the French Foreign Minister Pierre tienne Flandin should meet the ambassadors of the Locarno powers to discuss their reaction Georges Mandel was the sole voice in the French cabinet demanding that France should march at once into the Rhineland to expel the German troops regardless of the costs Later that day another cabinet meeting was called with GeneralSecretary Alexis St Leger representing the Quai dOrsay and Maurice Gamelin the military who decided to issue the statement saying France reserved every option to oppose the remilitarization Flandin upon hearing of the remilitarization immediately went to London to consult the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as Flandin wished for domestic political reasons to find a way of shifting the onus of not taking action onto British shoulders Baldwin asked Flandin what the French Government had in mind but Flandin said they had not yet decided Flandin went back to Paris and consulted the French Government what their response should be They agreed that France would place all her forces at the disposal of the League of Nations to oppose a violation of the Treaties On 8 March the Premier Albert Sarraut went on French radio to state In the name of the French government I declare that we intend to see maintained that essential guarantee of French and Belgian security countersigned by the English and Italian governments constituted by the Treaty of Locarno We are not disposed to allow Strasbourg to come under fire from German guns At the same time the French cabinet had decided that We will put all our forces material and moral at the disposal of the League of Nationson the one condition that we shall be accompanied in the fight for peace by those who are clearly bound themselves to do so by the Rhineland pact In other words France would act against Germany only if Britain and Italy acted likewise

Since the French government for economic reasons had already ruled out mobilization and hence war as a way of reversing Hitlers Rhineland coup it was decided that the best that France could do under the situation was to use the crisis to obtain the continental commitment ie a British commitment to send large ground forces to the defense of France on the same scale of World War I The strategy of Flandin was to strongly imply to the British that France was willing to go to war with Germany over the Rhineland issue in the expectation that the British were not willing to see their Locarno commitments lead them into a war with the Germans over an issue where many in Britain felt that the Germans were in the right As such Flandin expected London to apply pressure for restraint on Paris The price of the French restraint in regards to the Rhineland provocation an open violation of both the Versailles and Locarno treaties was to be the British continental commitment unequivocally linking British security to French security and committing the British to send another large expeditionary force to defend France in the event of a German attack

During his visit to London to consult with the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden Flandin carried out what the Canadian historian Robert J Young called the performance of a lifetime in which he expressed a great deal of outrage at the German move stated quite openly that France was prepared to go to war over the issue and strongly criticized his British hosts for the demands for French restraint while not offering to do anything for French scurit security As expected by Flandin Eden was opposed to the French taking military action and appealed for French restraint Not aware of what Flandin was attempting to do French military officials urged the government to tell Flandin to tone down his language In the face of Flandins tactics on March 19 1936 the British government made a vague statement linking British security to French security and for the first time since World War I agreed to AngloFrench staff talks albeit of very limited scope Though disappointed with the British offers which the French felt were too little the French nonetheless considered the pledges of British support gained in 1936 to be a worthwhile achievement especially given that for economic reasons mobilization was not considered a realistic option in 1936 Those French officials such as Quai dOrsays directeur politique Political Director Ren Massigli who believed in the idea of an AngloFrench alliance as the best way of stopping German expansionism expressed a great deal of disappointment that Britain was not prepared to do more for French scurit In a report to Flandin Massigli warned that if French accepted remilitarization then the Poles the Yugoslavs and the Romanians would drift into the German orbit while Czechoslovakia would do its best to stay loyal to its 1924 alliance with France and it would only be a matter of time before Germany annexed Austria In particular Massigli warned if the Germans were able to fortify the Rhineland that would essentially mean giving the Reich a free hand to expand into Eastern Europe As part of an effort to secure more in the way of the longdesired continental commitment that had been a major goal of French foreign policy since 1919 Gamelin told the British military attach that

The generalissimo of the French Army General Gamelin told the French government that if France countered the German forces and this caused a long war France would be unable to win fighting alone and therefore would need British assistance The French Government with an upcoming general election in mind decided against general mobilization of the French Army The remilitarization removed the last hold France had over Germany and therefore ended the security France had gained from the Treaty of Versailles As long as the Rhineland was demilitarized the French could easily reoccupy the area and threaten the economically important Ruhr industrial area which was liable to French invasion if France believed the situation in Germany ever became a threat

The reaction in Britain was mixed but they did not generally regard the remilitarization as harmful Lord Lothian famously said it was no more than the Germans walking into their own backyard George Bernard Shaw similarly claimed it was no different than if Britain had reoccupied Portsmouth In his diary entry for 23 March Harold Nicolson MP noted that the feeling in the House of Commons is terribly proGerman which means afraid of war During the Rhineland crisis of 1936 no public meetings or rallies were held anywhere in protest at the remilitarization of the Rhineland and instead there were several peace rallies where it was demanded that Britain not use war to resolve the crisis Ever since the economist John Maynard Keynes had published his bestselling book The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919in which Keynes depicted Versailles as an unbearably harsh Carthaginian peace imposed by the vindictive Alliesan increasingly large segment of British public opinion had become convinced that the Treaty of Versailles was deeply unjust to Germany By 1936 when German troops marched back into the Rhineland the majority of British people believed that Hitler was right to violate the unjust Versailles treaty and it would be morally wrong for Britain to go to war to uphold the unjust Treaty of Versailles The British War Secretary Alfred Duff Cooper told the German Ambassador Leopold von Hoesch on 8 March through the British people were prepared to fight for France in the event of a German incursion into French territory they would not resort to arms on account of the recent occupation of the Rhineland The people did not know much about the demilitarization provisions and most of them probably took the view that they did not care two hoots about the Germans reoccupying their own territory

The Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin claimed with tears in his eyes that Britain lacked the resources to enforce her treaty guarantees and that public opinion would not stand for military force anyway The British Chiefs of Staff had warned that war with Germany was inadvisable under the grounds that the deep cuts imposed by the Ten Year Rule together with the fact that rearmament had only begun in 1934 meant that at most Britain could do in the event of war would be to send two divisions with backward equipment to France after three weeks of preparation Additionally fears were expressed in Whitehall if Britain went to war with Germany then Japan which since 1931 when Japanese had seized Manchuria from China had been making claims to be the only power in the Far East might take advantage of the war to start seizing Britains Asian colonies

The British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden discouraged military action by the French and was against any financial or economic sanctions against Germany immediately meeting the French ambassador Charles Corbin to urge restraint on the French Eden instead wanted Germany to pull out all but a symbolic number of troops the number they said they were going to put in the first place and then renegotiate An additional factor that influenced British policy was the lack of the Dominion support All of the Dominion High Commissioners in London with South Africa and Canada being especially outspoken in this regard made it quite clear that they would not go to war to restore the demilitarized status of the Rhineland and that if Britain did so she would be on her own The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that by 13 March that the British Dominions especially the Union of South Africa and Canada would not stand with England if war came The South African government in particular was busy backing the German position in London and with the other Dominion governments Both the South African Prime Minister General J B M Hertzog and the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had to face domestic constituencies respectively the Afrikaners and the French Canadians many of whom had deep objections to fighting in another British war against Germany and as such both Hertzog and Mackenzie King were staunch supporters of appeasement as the best way of avoiding such a war Neither Hertzog nor Mackenzie King wished to have chose between loyalty to the British Empire vs dealing with antiBritish voters if war came Ever since the Chanak Crisis of 1922 Britain had been keenly conscious that Dominion support could no longer be automatically assumed and remembering the huge role the Dominions had played in the victory of 1918 could not consider fighting another major war without Dominion support

The British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitlers action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate As a Foreign Office memo complained Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate The Rhineland crisis completed the estrangement between Eden who believed that Hitlers proposals in his speech of 7 March were the grounds for a general settlement with Germany and Vansittart who argued that Hitler was negotiating in bad faith Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a general settlement with Hitler and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany The Germanophobe Vansittart had always hated the Germans and especially disliked the Nazis whom he saw as a menace to civilization Vansittart had supported Edens efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just began but being an intense Francophile Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany By the spring of 1936 Vansittart had become convinced that a general settlement with Germany was not possible and Hitler was seeking the conquest of the world A Foreign Office official Owen OMalley suggested that Britain give Germany a free hand in the East ie accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the Reich sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe By contrast Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe and did not share Vansittarts beliefs about what Hitlers ultimate intentions might be Nor did Eden the rest of the Cabinet or the majority of the British people share Vansittarts conviction that Britain could not afford to be indifferent about Eastern Europe

Though the British had agreed to staff talks with the French as the price of French restraint many British ministers were unhappy with these talks The Home Secretary Sir John Simon wrote to Eden and Baldwin that staff talks to be held with the French after the Rhineland remilitarization would lead the French to perceive that

In response to objections like Simons the British ended the staff talks with the French five days after they had begun AngloFrench staff talks were not to occur again until February 1939 in the aftermath of the Dutch War Scare of January 1939 Besides opposition within the cabinet the AngloFrench staff talks generated furious criticism from David Lloyd George and the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press who fumed as the Daily Mail put it in a leader over military arrangements that will commit us to some war at the call of others Furthermore Hitlers Extraordinary AmbassadoratLarge Joachim von Ribbentrop had warned Baldwin and Eden that Germany regarded the AngloFrench staff talks as a mortal threat and any hope of a general settlement with Germany would end forever if the talks continued However the rather hazily phrased British statement linking British security to French scurit was not disallowed out of the fear that it would irreparably damage AngloFrench relations which as the British historian A J P Taylor observed meant should France become involved in a war with Germany there would be at a minimum a strong moral case because of the statement of March 19 1936 for Britain to fight on the side of France

Until the statement by Neville Chamberlain on March 31 1939 offering the guarantee of Poland there were no British security commitments in Eastern Europe beyond the Covenant of the League of Nations However because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe the socalled Cordon sanitaire any German attack on Frances Eastern European allies would cause a FrancoGerman war and because of the statement of March 19 1936 a FrancoGerman war would create strong pressure for British intervention on the side of France This was all the more the case because unlike the Locarno where Britain was committed to come to Frances defence only in the event of a German attack the British statement of March 19 as part of an effort to be as vague as possible only stated Britain considered French security to be a vital national need and did not distinguish between a German attack on France vs France going to war with Germany in the event of a German attack on a member of the cordon sanitarie Thus in this way the British statement of March 1936 offered not only a direct British commitment to defend France albeit phrased in exceedingly ambiguous language but also indirectly to the Eastern European states of the cordon sanitaire In this way the British government found itself drawn into the Central European crisis of 1938 because the FrancoCzechoslovak alliance of 1924 meant any GermanCzechoslovak war would automatically become a FrancoGerman war It was because of this indirect security commitment that the British involved themselves in the Central European crisis of 1938 despite the widespread feeling that the GermanCzechoslovak dispute did not concern Britain directly

During a House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 12 March Winston Churchill a backbench Conservative MP argued for AngloFrench coordination under the League of Nations to help France challenge the remilitarization of the Rhineland but this never happened On 6 April Churchill said of the remilitarization The creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to be economized on that line and will enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland accurately predicting the Battle of France

Belgium concluded an alliance with France in 1920 but after the remilitarization Belgium opted again for neutrality On 14 October 1936 King Leopold III of Belgium said in a speech

Poland announced that the FrancoPolish Military Alliance signed in 1921 would be honoured although the treaty stipulated that Poland would aid France only if France was invaded At the same time that Colonel Beck was assuring the French ambassador Lon Nol of his commitment to the FrancoPolish alliance and Polands willingness to stand with France he was also telling the German ambassador Count HansAdolf von Moltke that since Germany was not planning on invading France the FrancoPolish alliance would not come into effect and Poland would do nothing if France acted Beck made a point of stressing to Moltke that Poland had not been allowed to sign Locarno and would not go to war for Locarno and that as one of the architects of the GermanPolish nonaggression pact of 1934 that he was a friend of the Reich Beck told Moltke on 9 March that his promise to go to war with France was in practice without effect because it only came into effect if German troops entered France Weinberg wrote that Becks duplicity during the Rhineland crisis of telling the German and French ambassadors different things about what Poland would do  did nothing for Becks personal reputation and involved enormous risks  for Poland Poland did agree to mobilize its forces if France did first however they abstained from voting against the remilitarization in the Council of the League of Nations

During the Rhineland crisis the isolationist American government took a strict hands off policy of doing nothing During the crisis President Franklin D Roosevelt went off on a diplomatically convenient extended fishing trip to Florida to avoid having to answer questions from journalists about what his administration planned to do in response to the crisis in Europe The general sentiment within the US government was expressed by Truman Smith the American military attach in Berlin who wrote that Hitler was seeking only to end French domination in Europe and was not seeking to destroy France as a power Smiths report concluded Versailles is dead There may possibly be a German catastrophe and a new Versailles but it will not be the Versailles which has hung like a dark cloud over Europe since 1920

In public the Soviet government took a strong line in denouncing the German coup as a threat to peace At the same time the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov was giving speeches before the General Assembly of the League of Nations praising collective security and urging the world to oppose Hitlers coup Soviet diplomats in Berlin were telling their counterparts at the Auswrtiges Amt of their desire for better commercial relations which in turn might lead to better political relations Just after the remilitarization the Soviet Premier Vyacheslav Molotov gave an interview with the Swiss newspaper Le Temps hinting that the Soviet Union wanted better relations with Germany In April 1936 the Soviet Union signed a commercial treaty with Germany providing for expanded GermanSoviet trade A major problem for the Soviet Union to go to war with Germany was the lack of a common GermanSoviet frontier which would require both the Polish and Romanian governments to grant transit right to the Red Army Despite their professed willingness to engage with the Wehrmacht the Narkomindel tended to negotiate with the Poles and the Romanians over transit rights in the event of a war in such a manner to suggest that they wanted the talks to fail suggesting that the Soviet hard line against Germany was just posturing The Romanians and even more so the Poles expressed a great deal of fear that if the Red Army were allowed transit rights to enter their countries on the way to fight Germany that they would fail to leave once the war was over the Narkomindel failed to provide convincing reassurances on that point

When the Council of the League of Nations met in London the only delegate in favour of sanctions against Germany was Maxim Litvinov the representative of the Soviet Union Though Germany was no longer a member of the League Ribbentrop was allowed to give a speech before the League Assembly on 19 March where he tried to justify Germanys actions as something imposed on the Reich by the FrancoSoviet pact and warned that there would be serious economic consequences for those states who voted to impose sanctions on Germany By 1936 a number of Eastern European Scandinavian and Latin American countries whose economies were hardpressed by the Great Depression had become very dependent upon trade with Germany to keep their economies afloat which meant for economic reasons alone none of those states wished to offend Germany President Federico Pez of Ecuador gave a speech in which he declared the idea of sanctions against the Reich to be nonsensical At the time the British Foreign Office estimated that Britain France Romania Belgium Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were the only nations in the entire world willing to impose sanctions on Germany The Swedish Danish Norwegian Polish Dutch Greek Swiss Turkish Chilean Estonian Portuguese Spanish and Finnish ambassadors to the League all let it be known that they regarded sanctions on Germany as economic suicide for their countries Mussolini who was still angry with the League sanctions applied against Italy made a speech in which he made it clear that he definitely would not be joining any sanctions against Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland In the fall of 1935 Britain had been able to have the League impose limited sanctions on Italy but by the later winter of 1936 the idea of imposing sweeping sanctions on Germanywhose economy was four times the size of Italys making Germany an economic octopus whose tentacles were everywhere around the worldwas unthinkable for rest of the world Moreover for the sanctions to work the United States had to join in In 1935 the American government had declared that as the US was not a League member it would not abide by the League sanctions on Italy which was hardly a hopeful precedent for the idea that US would join in with imposing sanctions on Germany Argentina declared that it would vote for sanctions against Germany only if the United States promised to join in The Council declared though not unanimously that the remilitarization constituted a breach of the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno Hitler was invited to plan a new scheme for European security and he responded by claiming he had no territorial claims in Europe and wanted a 25year pact of nonaggression with Britain and France However when the British Government inquired further into this proposed pact they did not receive a reply

The remilitarization changed the balance of power decisively in favor of the Reich French credibility in standing against German expansion or aggression was left in doubt French military strategy was entirely defensive and it had no intention whatsoever of invading Germany Instead it planned to defend the Maginot Line Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion without such deterrence the ally was militarily helpless Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border which is where Germany invaded in 1940 Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin All of Frances friends were disappointed  even the Pope told the French ambassador that Had you ordered the immediate advance of 200000 men into the zone the Germans had occupied you would have done everyone a very great favor

With the Rhineland remilitarized Germany started the construction of the Siegfried Line which meant that if Germany attacked any of the states in the cordon sanitaire the ability of France to threaten an invasion was henceforward limited Such was the impact of the remilitarization on the balance of power that the Czechoslovak President Edvard Bene seriously considered renouncing the alliance with France and instead seeking a rapprochement with Germany only abandoning that idea when it become clear that the price of a rapprochement with Hitler would be the effective loss of his countrys independence Likewise King Carol II of Romania concluded that Romania might have to abandon its alliance with France and instead accept that his country would have to move from being in the French sphere of influence to being in the German sphere of influence When William C Bullitt the newly appointed American ambassador to France visited Germany in May 1936 he met with Baron von Neurath On 18 May 1936 Bullitt reported to President Roosevelt that Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until the Rhineland had been digested He explained that he meant that until the German fortifications had been constructed on the French and Belgian borders the German government would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by Nazis in Austria and would pursue a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia As soon as our fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at will all those countries will begin to feel very differently about their foreign policies and a new constellation will develop he said Between the 1520 June 1936 the chiefs of staff of the Little Entente of Czechoslovakia Romania and Yugoslavia met to discuss the changed international situation They decided to maintain their present plans for a war with Hungary but concluded that with the Rhineland now remilitarized there was little hope of effective French action in the event of a war with Germany The meeting ended with the conclusion that there now were only two great powers in Eastern Europe namely Germany and the Soviet Union and the best that could be hoped for was to avoid another war that would almost certainly mean the loss of their nations independence regardless of who won Weinberg wrote that attitude of the entire German elite and much of the German people that any new war would only benefit Germany and that ending the Rhinelands demilitarized status could only be a good thing as it opened the door to starting a new war was an extremely shortsighted selfdestructive and stupid attitude even from a narrowly German viewpoint Weinberg notes that Germany lost its independence in 1945 and lost far more territory under the OderNeisse line imposed in 1945 than it ever had under Versailles together with millions of dead and the destruction of its cities Thus from the German viewpoint the best thing to do would have been to accept Versailles rather than start a new warone which ended with Germany being totally crushed partitioned and occupied

Bird Island North Carolina
Bird Island is approximately adjacent to the coastal resort town of Sunset Beach North Carolina USA Sunset Beach is on a barrier island and is the southernmost town in North Carolina Bird Island can be reached by walking along the seashore toward the South Carolina border Due to the contour of the Atlantic Coast at this point the direction of travel to Bird Island is approximately WestSouthwest Previously Bird Island was separated from Sunset Beach by a tidal creek Mad Inlet that could be easily crossed only at low tide Accretion of ocean sand due to hurricane activity in the 1990s as well as environmental activity to fill in dune grass has gradually filled in the tidal creek so that two separate islands became one

Bird Island was privately owned prior to 2002 The shoreline dunes and marshland of Bird Island provide important habitat and nesting for species that are endangered threatened or of special concern including the Kemps Ridley and Loggerhead sea turtles Although there was no vehicular access to this land there was the threat that the land might some day be developed The state of North Carolina used 42 million of public and private funding to purchase the land and create a coastal reserve administered by the North Carolina Division of Coastal Management

To help Steele obtain additional art training in Europe his friend and art patron Herman Lieber arranged to provide financial support for the family so Steele could study at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich In exchange for future paintings from Steele thirteen patrons each pledged 100 to support Steeles studies In 1880 the Steele family sailed to Europe with fellow Hoosiers J Ottis Adams Carrie Wolf August Metzner and Samuel Richards The group was joined two years later by Hoosier artist William Forsyth In addition to training at the Royal Academy under the instruction of artists Gyula Benczr and Ludwig Lfftz Steele spent hours studying paintings of the Old Masters in Munichs Alte Pinakothek galleries He also painted in the countryside with his family and other artists including Boston landscape painter J Frank Currier Steele enjoyed plein air or outdoor painting which is reflected in many of his landscapes At Steeles request his sponsors extended their financial support so that he could continue studies in Munich for two more years Steele also used funds earned from painting copies of Old Masters to pay for several additional months before the family returned to Indiana in 1885

Upon their return to Indianapolis the Steele family rented the Tinker mansion Talbott Place at Sixteenth and Pennsylvania Streets Steele kept a studio downtown where he could paint and display his work while he earned a living primarily as a portrait painter and art teacher Around 1886 Steele had a studio built on the Tinker property and the home already an Indianapolis landmark became a hub for the local arts community

Steeles paintings showed a notable change in style after his return from Munich Steeles Munich paintings sported dark drab colors and high contrasts but his work in Indiana gradually shifted toward a brighter more vivid color palette Steele was especially interested in capturing the beauty of nature through expressions of light and color His paintings included both urban and rural scenes and depicted changes of season as well as weather conditions of snow rain and sunshine Steeles works show a sympathic and technical grasp of his subjects with a comprehension of the majestic aspects of nature with much feeling for the influence of light and atmosphere

In addition to local exhibitions Steeles art appeared outside of Indiana including the Eighth Annual Exhibition of the prestigious Society of American Artists at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1886 During the summer months Steele took his family to the country where he painted rural landscapes The Muscatatuck River near Vernon Indiana was a favorite locale Fellow landscape artist Forsyth frequently accompanied Steele on these expeditions Steele also painted in Vermont and Tennessee where he had taken his first wife Libby in hopes of improving her health

The 1890s were a turning point in Steeles career In 1890 Steele published The Steele Portfolio which contained twentyfive photogravure prints of his paintings including The Boatman his prizewinning student work from Munich In 1891 Forsyth joined Steele as an instructor at the Indiana Art School which Steele established in 1889 Steele continued to teach there until 1895 before returning to painting on a fulltime basis In November 1894 the Art Association of Indianapolis sponsored the Exhibit of Summer Work by Steele Forsyth Richard B Gruelle and Otto Stark The exhibition so impressed art critic and novelist Hamlin Garland that he arranged to have the exhibition shown in Chicago Sponsored by the Central Art Association the Indiana exhibit called Five Hoosier Painters expanded to include paintings by Adams This Chicago exhibition is credited with launching the careers of the Hoosier Group of Indiana painters

Throughout the 1890s Steele painted landscapes during the warm months and returned to a winter studio to paint portraits still his primary source of income In addition Steele actively exhibited his work delivered lectures and helped organize the Society of Western Artists whose annual exhibition attracted national attention Steele later became the organizations president Steele painted outdoors near Vernon then moved on to Bloomington in Monroe County Indiana and Metamora in Franklin County Indiana where he did some of his best work The area around Metamora was instrumental in the development of Hoosier landscape painting Fellow landscape painters Adams Forsyth Stark and others joined Steele as he painted outdoors In 1898 Steele and Adams bought a home in Brookville Indiana eight miles east of Metamora so they could be closer to the areas scenic beauty Named The Hermitage the home was quiet secluded and provided a place where the artists could work without interruption In 1899 Steele became a member of the jury that selected American paintings for inclusion in the Paris Universal Exposition in 1900 a worlds fair expected to attract millions of visitors Sadly Steeles wife Libby died at the age of fortynine in November 1899

The new century marked a number of changes in Steeles life In 1900 he received an honorary master of arts degree from Wabash College in Crawfordsville Indiana That same year the Art Association of Indianapolis received a large donation from John Herron to establish a museum and art school in the city The association selected the Tinker mansion Steeles home in Indianapolis and purchased the property from his landlord Steeles art studio became the first Herron School of Art Steele leased another home on East Saint Clair Street in Indianapolis Portrait commissions remained a major source of income for Steele and his subjects included poet James Whitcomb Riley the official portraits of several Indiana governors President Benjamin Harrison and other prominent Hoosiers

In 1902 Steele and his daughter Daisy traveled to the West Coast to visit family in Oregon and Redlands California The crosscounty trip inspired Steele to paint more than a dozen exceptional works of art He entered several of his West Coast paintings in the Society of Western Artists Sixth Annual Exhibition which was well received by art critics Steele and his daughter made another crosscountry trip in 1903 A year later Steele was invited to be a juror on the selection committee of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition the 1904 worlds fair at Saint Louis Four of Steeles paintings were selected for the exposition and an additional five paintings were shown in the Indiana Building At home in Indianapolis Steele became actively involved in plans for the Art Associations new museum serving as chair of the acquisitions committee The Tinker house was demolished in 1905 to make space for the Herron Art Institute In 1906 Steele sold his interest in The Hermitage at Brookville to Adams and returned to Indianapolis where he remained active in the arts community

As Steele explored new places to paint he discovered an isolated area of Brown County Indiana where he built a hilltop studiohome on of land one and a half miles south of Belmont between Bloomington and Nashville Indiana Steele moved into the new summer residence with his second wife Selma in August 1907 Inspired by the breezes blowing through the cottages screened porches they named it the House of the Singing Winds The land while not suitable for agricultural purpose provided Steele with beautiful picturesque woods and hills and valleys

Slowly over time the Steeles developed their Brown County property acquiring additional acreage to increase it to a total of of land and making further improvements to include an enlarged home and surround it with beautiful gardens a barnsized studiogallery and several other outbuildings The couple made it their yearround residence in 1912

Steele kept a studio in Indianapolis but his home in rural Brown County increasingly attracted visitors and other artists to the area Despite its remote location visitors came out of curiosity to see the scenic beauty surrounding the painters home Steeles presence in Brown County along with other fulltime resident artists such as Will Vawter Gustave Baumann Dale Bessire and others helped attract newcomers to the growing Brown County Art Colony

Steeles reputation in the art world continued to rise In 1913 he was elected as an associate artist to the National Academy of Design in New York confirming Steeles standing as the most famous Hoosier artist of his time Three of his paintings were accepted in the prestigious PanamaPacific International Exposition in San Francisco California in 1915

In 1922 Steele accepted an appointment as Indiana Universitys first artist in residence Steele and his wife Selma rented a home in Bloomington Indiana during the winter months but returned to their home in Brown County each summer On campus Steele kept a studio on the top floor of IUs University Library now Franklin Hall where he and his wife greeted visitors and students could watch him paint

Steele continued to exhibit his art including a major exhibition called the Hoosier Salon held in Chicago and organized by The Daughters of Indiana He also maintained a busy lecture schedule

In December 1925 Steele suffered a heart attack Although he recovered and continued to paint he became ill the following June and died at home in Brown County on July 24 1926 His ashes were buried on a hillside that was reserved for a family cemetery the T C Steele Memorial Cemetery on the Steeles property near Belmont in Brown County Indiana

Sunday in New York
Sunday in New York is a 1963 American Metrocolor romantic comedy film directed by Peter Tewksbury and starring Jane Fonda Rod Taylor and Cliff Robertson The soundtrack score was composed and performed by Peter Nero although Mel Torm contributed the vocals for the title song

Eileen Tyler Fonda a 22yearold music critic for the Albany Times Union is suffering from her breakup with Russ Robert Culp from a rich Albany family She comes to New York City to visit her brother Adam Robertson who is an airline pilot Eileen confides to her brother that she thinks she may be the only 22yearold virgin left in the world Adam assures her that sex is not what all men look for and insists he hasnt slept around Of course Adam is lying and is in hot pursuit of a tryst with his occasional girlfriend Mona However Adams date with Mona has a series of jobrelated interruptions Meanwhile Eileen decides to see if she can have some fun in New York and seems to find the perfect candidate in Mike Taylor a man she meets on the bus But things get complicated when Russ pops in with a proposal and a mistaken assumption Mike later confesses to Eileen his feelings whereby she has a change of heart


The screenplay by Norman Krasna was adapted from his play which had been produced on Broadway by David Merrick starring Robert Redford and directed by Garson Kanin It ran for 188 performances

Hedda Hopper reported in November 1960 that Krasna was writing the play in Switzerland where he had a home The play was optioned by David Merrick who arranged Garson Kanin to direct Kanin had directed Krasnas script for Bachelor Mother in 1939 Kanin called it Krasnas best play with a lot of feeling and very funny 

Peter Graves and Jane Fonda were discussed as leads in the play Then in May 1961 Carroll Baker was mooted as star Baker ended up going into Come on Strong a play written by Kanin The lead roles went to Pat Stanley Robert Redford and Conrad Janis Rehearsals took place in October 1961

The New York Times called it inventive and chic Only the substance is familiar and thin Walter Kerr called it a sentimentalised farce precisely the kind of echo chamber exercise that drives intelligent young theatregoers to complete despair

The show closed in May 1962 after 189 performances

The play ran for two years in Paris and had a successful run in Los Angeles in a production starring Marlo Thomas
The show was seen by Eliot Hyman and Ray Stark of Seven Arts Productions who thought it would make a good movie according to Stark Other companies were interested in film rights but they called Krasna direct in Switzerland and did the deal The rights cost 150000 plus a percentage of the gross

The film was a part of a multipicture deal between Seven Arts and MGM Lead roles originally were offered to Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty who turned them down

Peter Tewksbury best known for his work in TV signed to direct

In a review of the playwrights frank screen version of the play Bosley Crowther characterized the film as another in a series of films that dwelled on a subject first brought to the screen ten years earlier in The Moon Is Blue There once was a time when the candor of Mr Krasnas mildly popular Broadway play about an Albany girl who struggles bravely with the problem of her virtue during a rainy afternoon in New York might have caused the Production Code people a moment or two of anxious pause They might then have thought it a bit too racy for youthful and innocent ears on the film itself Crowther said the extent of the films disconcertion and delight for a viewer will depend upon how prone one may be to a juvenile quandary and to the nimble performing of a pleasant cast The twists of the plot are downright hackneyedthe confusions of opening the wrong doors mistaking people and getting caught in dishabille But the actors are all attractive and so long as one can go along with them in their valiant attempts at pretending this is hot stuff one may have a good time

According to Time magazine Sunday in New York is another brightly salacious Hollywood comedy about the way of a man with a maid who just may This motion picture leers an announcement flashed on the screen as a teaser is dedicated to the proposition that every girl getssooner or later As usual winking wickedness turns out to be mostly eyewash but the plotmore to be pitied than censoredgets a buoyant lift from stars Jane Fonda Cliff Robertson and Rod Taylor All three abandon themselves to the film version of Norman Krasnas trite Broadway farce with disarming faith as though one more glossy glittering package of pseudo sex might save the world

Any Wednesday
Any Wednesday is a 1966 American Technicolor romantic comedy film starring Jane Fonda Jason Robards and Dean Jones It was directed by Robert Ellis Miller from a screenplay by producer Julius J Epstein based on the hit play of the same name by Muriel Resnik which played on Broadway for 984 performances from 1964 to 1966 The film was titled Bachelor Girl Apartment in the UK

The story centers on a Manhattan woman Fonda who is trying to decide between two suitors one married Robards and one not Jones on the day of her 30th birthday

John Cleves Jason Robards is a businessman with an office in New York and a home in New Jersey On one day of each week Wednesday he spends the night in the city lying to wife Dorothy Rosemary Murphy that he is out of town on business when he actually is seeing Ellen his mistress Jane Fonda

A business client from Akron Ohio Cass Henderson Dean Jones comes to town and is unable to find a hotel room for the night Cleves new secretary knows of an executive suite the boss maintains in town so Cass is sent there for the night When he meets Ellen he mistakenly assumes she is a certain kind of lady hired by Cleves to entertain him

The secretary compounds the error by telling Dorothy about the apartment Dorothy goes there and discovers Ellen and Cass assuming them to be a young couple The women take a liking to each other so Dorothy invites them to spend an evening out on the town with her and John

Dorothy eventually catches on to what her husband is up to and leaves him Ellen invites her to use the apartment John goes there and tries to win his wifes love back but she just tells her husband to come visit her on any Wednesday


Exterior location scenes for Any Wednesday were filmed in Manhattan New York City

During the course of the 28month run of the play Any Wednesday on Broadway the role of Ellen was played by Sandy Dennis  who won a Tony Award for her performance  and Barbara Cook Don Porter and Gene Hackman also appeared in it

Richard F Shepard of The New York Times was fairly positive writing that the story had made the transition from stage to screen not much the worse for wear though he felt it might have been better if it were shorter The funny lines and there are a good number would have been even sharper Variety called it an outstanding sophisticated comedy with solid direction and excellent performances Philip K Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote Neither Jason Robards nor Jane Fonda strikes me particularly as a natural comedian whatever that may be and the timing of both seems off  In the case of Robards a superior actor whenever he is permitted to be I must admit to some surprise that he was willing to waste his time and talents on such a contrived and cinematically weak affair as this Richard L Coe of The Washington Post called Fonda miscast because she is simply not the sort of girl who doesnt know what she is doing He thought Rosemary Murphy stole the film with an immensely amusing performance The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote A moderately entertaining film version of a Broadway stage production but it could have been much more so if director Robert Ellis Miller had a lighter touch

Jane Fonda was nominated for a 1966 Golden Globe Award in the category Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture  Musical or Comedy

On August 18 2009 Warner Home Video released the movie on DVDR as part of the Warner Archive Collection

<doc id="7735022" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7735022" title="Cage graph theory">
Cage graph theory
In the mathematical area of graph theory a cage is a regular graph that has as few vertices as possible for its girth

Formally an rggraph is defined to be a graph in which each vertex has exactly r neighbors and in which the shortest cycle has length exactly g It is known that an rggraph exists for any combination of r  2 and g  3 An rgcage is an rggraph with the fewest possible number of vertices among all rggraphs

If a Moore graph exists with degree r and girth g it must be a cage Moreover the bounds on the sizes of Moore graphs generalize to cages any cage with odd girth g must have at least

vertices and any cage with even girth g must have at least

vertices Any rggraph with exactly this many vertices is by definition a Moore graph and therefore automatically a cage

There may exist multiple cages for a given combination of r and g For instance there are three nonisomorphic 310cages each with 70 vertices  the Balaban 10cage the Harries graph and the HarriesWong graph But there is only one 311cage  the Balaban 11cage with 112 vertices

A degreeone graph has no cycle and a connected degreetwo graph has girth equal to its number of vertices so cages are only of interest for r  3 The r3cage is a complete graph K on r1 vertices and the r4cage is a complete bipartite graph K on 2r vertices

Other notable cages include the Moore graphs

The numbers of vertices in the known rg cages for values of r  2 and g  2 other than projective planes and generalized polygons are
For large values of g the Moore bound implies that the number n of vertices must grow at least singly exponentially as a function of g Equivalently g can be at most proportional to the logarithm of n More precisely
It is believed that this bound is tight or close to tight  The best known lower bounds on g are also logarithmic but with a smaller constant factor implying that n grows singly exponentially but at a higher rate than the Moore bound Specifically the Ramanujan graphs satisfy the bound

This bound was improved slightly by 

It is unlikely that these graphs are themselves cages but their existence gives an upper bound to the number of vertices needed in a cage

Broad Sound is a large bay on the east coast of Australia in the state of Queensland 675km northwest of the state capital Brisbane It is about 50km long and 20km across at its widest point The Torilla Peninsula forms the eastern side of the bay Shoalwater Bay is on the other side of the peninsula 

British explorer James Cook in HMS Endeavour sighted the bay in May 1770 naming it for its size The next European navigator in the area was Matthew Flinders in HMS Investigator in 1802

The town of St Lawrence was established midway between Rockhampton and Mackay on St Lawrence Creek and developed as a port for the export of cattle from the hinterland with a large meatworks built close by in 1893 The processing and export of meat and cattle continued until 1919 when rail links were built elsewhere making the port redundant By 2006 the population of St Lawrence had dropped to 125 out of a population in the Broad Sound area of 268

The bay has a lowlying coastline with wide mudflats exposed at low tide and backed by extensive areas of mangroves The head of the bay has the greatest tidal range on Australias east coast  around 9m The coastline is punctuated by the mangrovelined estuaries of several rivers and creeks including Herbert and St Lawrence Creeks and the Styx River Behind the mangroves is a hinterland of low rounded hills covered by a mix of grassland and low eucalypt woodland or forest The climate is subtropical with a dry winter

The extensive tracts of mangroves and mudflats comprising some 1200km in the southern part of the bay have been classified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area It supports globally important populations of the strawnecked ibis with up to 15000 individual birds Australian bustard Lathams snipe sharptailed sandpiper and mangrove honeyeater

At the peak of the Vietnam war upheaval in the United States in May 1968 Warner graduated from Yale University with a BA degree and intended to go to Yale medical school after leaving Yale undergraduate Without a college deferment Warner most likely would have been classified as 1A that is to say classified as available immediately for military service For example President Bush was classified as 1A on Bushs graduation from Yale in May 1968 and was accepted into the Texas Air National Guard at the height of the ongoing Vietnam War

With the Vietnam war and Yale medical school choices facing Warner Warner looked to a third option based on advice from his father an insurance man from Cincinnati Ohio Warners father advised Warner to go into business to develop some breadth and subsequently Warner entered the management training program at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company in New York City At that time Morgan Guaranty Trust Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase  Co formerly JP Morgan  Co Incorporated Over the next seven years Warner rapidly advanced from officers assistant 19681970 through assistant treasurer 19701972 and assistant Vice President 19721975 to Vice President in 1975

Warner was recently selected for a coveted sixyear term on the Yale Corporation Yale Universitys governing body

Analysts say that Mr Warner was a key figure throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the transformation of JP Morgan from a commercial bank to an investment banking firm For example JP Morgan was the first commercial bank since the 1930s to be granted the power to underwrite debt and equity securities Under Warner the firm ended lifelong job security as a result of a 1998 restructuring One of his biggest cultural marks on JP Morgan was the creation of the House Arrest group a dozen or so senior executives who met monthly to discuss management issues


In 1998 Warner was an invited Gordon Grand Fellow lecturer at Yale University and in 2001 he was awarded the Leadership Award from The Hill School As an alumnus of The Hill School Warner had proven himself to be an exemplary leader and true role model for students in his vocation

The Current song
The Current is a song by Blue Man Group released as the first single from their 2003 concept album The Complex The song features the guest vocals of Gavin Rossdale of Bush and was featured in the film 

The song deals with urban and occupational isolation the two key themes from the album The isolation theme is furthered by the setting which takes place in the underground portion of the urban complexthe location of the phone lines electrical wires and Internet connections According to the Blue Man Group themselves We wanted to capture the modern paradox of having access to millions of people through electric current but still being cut off from any real human contact

The song might then be assumed to be about how technology is moving the world forward whilst it moves people backwards

Another promo CD was released in a cardboard slide case

I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day
I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day is a Christmas carol based on the 1863 poem Christmas Bells by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow The song tells of the narrators despair upon hearing Christmas bells that hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth good will to men The carol concludes with the bells carrying renewed hope for peace among men

In 1861 two years before writing this poem Longfellows personal peace was shaken when his second wife of 18 years to whom he was very devoted was tragically burned in a fire
Then in 1863 during the American Civil War Longfellows oldest son Charles Appleton Longfellow joined the Union cause as a soldier without his fathers blessing Longfellow was informed by a letter dated March 14 1863 after Charles had left I have tried hard to resist the temptation of going without your leave but I cannot any longer he wrote I feel it to be my first duty to do what I can for my country and I would willingly lay down my life for it if it would be of any good Charles soon got an appointment as a lieutenant but in November he was severely wounded in the Battle of New Hope Church in Virginia during the Mine Run Campaign Charles eventually recovered but his time as a soldier was finished

Longfellow first wrote the poem on Christmas Day in 1863 Christmas Bells was first published in February 1865 in Our Young Folks a juvenile magazine published by Ticknor and Fields References to the Civil War are prevalent in some of the verses that are not commonly sung

The following are the original words of Longfellows poem

poem
I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old familiar carols play 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And thought how as the day had come
The belfries of all Christendom 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Till ringing singing on its way
The world revolved from night to day
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then from each black accursed mouth
The cannon thundered in the South 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

It was as if an earthquake rent
The hearthstones of a continent
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said 
Of peace on earth goodwill to men

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor doth He sleep 
With peace on earth goodwill to men
poem

It was not until 1872 that the poem is known to have been set to music The English organist John Baptiste Calkin used the poem in a processional accompanied with a melody he previously used as early as 1848 The Calkin version of the carol was long the standard Less commonly the poem has also been set to Joseph Mainzers composition Mainzer 1845 In 2011 Jack Gibbons the British pianist and composer set Longfellows poem to music in his role as artistinresidence at Davis  Elkins College and the first performance was given by the Davis  Elkins College choir on December 4 2011 Since at least the middle of the 20th century the poem has been set to other musical arrangements

In 1956 Bing Crosbys version recorded on October 3 1956 and released as a single that reached No 55 in the Music Vendor survey The record was praised by both Billboard and Variety Bing Crosbys workover of I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day looks like a big one for the 56 Yule and a hit potential of enduring value At deadline time not many of this years Christmas issues had shown much action This new Crosby record however was off to a promising start As fast as it is catching on early in the month it is easy to project the impressive volume it will rack up the last half of December

In chapter five of his 1962 novel Something Wicked This Way Comes Ray Bradbury describes this carol as immensely moving overwhelming no matter what day or what month it was sung The carol provides an ironic contrast to the evil that Mr Darks carnival is about to bring to Green Town Illinois where the story takes place In the 1983 film adaptation of the novel Mr Dark Jonathan Pryce and Charles Halloway Jason Robards both quote passages from the carol when they meet in the towns library though Dark ominously states that its a thousand years to Christmas

In 2008 the contemporary Christian music group Casting Crowns scored their eighth No 1 Christian hit with I Heard the Bells from their album Peace on Earth The song is not an exact replica of the original poem or carol but an interpolation of verses 1 6 7 and 3 in that order interposed with a new chorus However the new version has reintroduced the original poem to a modern listeners

FamaMacBeth regression
The FamaMacBeth regression is a method used to estimate parameters for asset pricing models such as the Capital asset pricing model CAPM The method estimates the betas and risk premia for any risk factors that are expected to determine asset prices The method works with multiple assets across time panel data The parameters are estimated in two steps


Eugene F Fama and James D MacBeth 1973 demonstrated that the residuals of riskreturn regressions and the observed fair game properties of the coefficients are consistent with an efficient capital market quotes in the original

Note that Fama MacBeth regressions provide standard errors corrected only for crosssectional correlation The standard errors from this method do not correct for timeseries autocorrelation This is usually not a problem for stock trading since stocks have weak timeseries autocorrelation in daily and weekly holding periods but autocorrelation is stronger over long horizons This means Fama MacBeth regressions may be inappropriate to use in many corporate finance settings where project holding periods tend to be long For alternative methods of correcting standard errors for time series and crosssectional correlation in the error term look into double clustering by firm and year

At 63 and 190 pounds Siegfried was considered a prototype guard for the NBA at that time The Cincinnati Royals drafted him with their first pick in 1961 to pair with Oscar Robertson in their backcourt Siegfried would not play in Cincinnati because of Ohio States loss to Cincinnatis Bearcats that year Instead he joined the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League The team owned by future Yankee boss George Steinbrenner and coached by John McLendon and Bill Sharman won that pro leagues 196162 title Dick Barnett and Connie Dierking were among that teams stars The highly drafted Siegfried was just a reserve

When the ABL folded the next year the St Louis Hawks acquired his rights but then surprisingly cut him Siegfried considered retirement becoming a high school coach and teacher before former college teammate Havlicek convinced coach Red Auerbach to try him out for the Boston Celtics Slowly regaining his confidence Siegfried proved to be a key pickup He eventually became a starter next to Havlicek or Sam Jones in the backcourt His defense and free throw shooting were key to NBA title wins for Boston in 1968 and 1969 Boston announcer Johnny Most often noted his tenacious defense calling Ziggys in his shirt tonight to describe Siegfried on many nights

Siegfried played his first seven professional seasons with the Boston Celtics earning five championship rings during that time He led the NBA in free throw percentage in both the 196566 and 196869 seasons

Siegfried spent the last season of his career with the Rockets and Hawks organizations

Following his NBA career Siegfried counseled prisoners at the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Ohio and did motivational speakingHe also served briefly as the Executive Director of the Central Ohio Chapter of The Associated Builders  Contractors ABC He died of a heart attack on October 14 2010

Behavioural change theories
Behavioural change theories are attempts to explain why behaviours change These theories cite environmental personal and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination In recent years there has been increased interest in the application of these theories in the areas of health education criminology energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change will improve the services offered in these areas Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior theories of change are more processoriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior Thus from this perspective understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation

Each behavioural change theory or model focuses on different factors in attempting to explain behaviour change Of the many that exist the most prevalent are learning theories social cognitive theory theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour transtheoretical model of behavior change the health action process approach and the BJ Fogg model of behavior change Research has also been conducted regarding specific elements of these theories especially elements like selfefficacy that are common to several of the theories

Selfefficacy is an individuals impression of their own ability to perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery This impression is based upon factors like the individuals prior success in the task or in related tasks the individuals physiological state and outside sources of persuasion Selfefficacy is thought to be predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change so although selfefficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se it is an important element of many of the theories including the health belief model the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach

From behaviourists such as B F Skinner come the learning theories which state that complex behaviour is learned gradually through the modification of simpler behaviours Imitation and reinforcement play important roles in these theories which state that individuals learn by duplicating behaviours they observe in others and that rewards are essential to ensuring the repetition of desirable behaviour As each simple behaviour is established through imitation and subsequent reinforcement the complex behaviour develops When verbal behaviour is established the organism can learn through rulegoverned behaviour and thus not all action needs to be contingency shaped

According to the social learning theory more recently expanded as social cognitive theory behavioural change is determined by environmental personal and behavioural elements Each factor affects each of the others For example in congruence with the principles of selfefficacy an individuals thoughts affect their behaviour and an individuals characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment Likewise an individuals environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the persons behavior and an individuals behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change

The theory of reasoned action assumes that individuals consider a behaviours consequences before performing the particular behaviour As a result intention is an important factor in determining behaviour and behavioural change According to Icek Ajzen intentions develop from an individuals perception of a behaviour as positive or negative together with the individuals impression of the way their society perceives the same behaviour Thus personal attitude and social pressure shape intention which is essential to performance of a behaviour and consequently behavioural change

In 1985 Ajzen expanded upon the theory of reasoned action formulating the theory of planned behaviour which also emphasises the role of intention in behaviour performance but is intended to cover cases in which a person is not in control of all factors affecting the actual performance of a behaviour As a result the new theory states that the incidence of actual behaviour performance is proportional to the amount of control an individual possesses over the behaviour and the strength of the individuals intention in performing the behaviour In his article Further hypothesises that selfefficacy is important in determining the strength of the individuals intention to perform a behaviour In 2010 Fishbein and Ajzen introduced the reasoned action approach the successor of the theory of planned behaviour

According to the transtheoretical model of behavior change also known as the stages of change model states that there are five stages towards behavior change The five stages between which individuals may transition before achieving complete change are precontemplation contemplation preparation for action action and maintenance At the precontemplation stage an individual may or may not be aware of a problem but has no thought of changing their behavior From precontemplation to contemplation the individual begins thinking about changing a certain behavior During preparation the individual begins his plans for change and during the action stage the individual begins to exhibit new behavior consistently An individual finally enters the maintenance stage once they exhibit the new behavior consistently for over six months A problem faced with the stages of change model is that it is very easy for a person to enter the maintenance stage and then fall back into earlier stages Factors that contribute to this decline include external factors such as weather or seasonal changes andor personal issues a person is dealing with

The health action process approach HAPA is designed as a sequence of two continuous selfregulatory processes a goalsetting phase motivation and a goalpursuit phase volition The second phase is subdivided into a preaction phase and an action phase Motivational selfefficacy outcomeexpectancies and risk perceptions are assumed to be predictors of intentions This is the motivational phase of the model The predictive effect of motivational selfefficacy on behaviour is assumed to be mediated by recovery selfefficacy and the effects of intentions are assumed to be mediated by planning The latter processes refer to the volitional phase of the model

The Fogg Behavior Model FBM is a design behavior change model introduced by BJ Fogg This model posits that behavior is composed of three different factors motivation ability and triggers Under the FBM for any person user to succeed at behavior change needs to be motivated have the ability to perform the behavior and needs a trigger to perform this behavior The next are the definitions of each of the elements of the BFM

BJ Fogg does not provide a definition of motivation but instead defines different motivators

This factor refers to the self efficacy perception at performing a target behavior Although low ability is undesirable it may be unavoidable We are fundamentally lazy according to BJ Fogg In such case behavior change is approached not through learning but instead by promoting target behaviors for which the user has a high ability Additionally BJ Fogg list several elements or dimensions that characterize high ability or simplicity of performing a behavior 

Triggers are reminders that may be explicit or implicit about the performance of a behavior Examples of triggers can be alarms text messages or advertisement triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing this will take considerably less effort Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories eg the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Selfefficacy

Behavioural change theories can be used as guides in developing effective teaching methods Since the goal of much education is behavioural change the understanding of behaviour afforded by behavioural change theories provides insight into the formulation of effective teaching methods that tap into the mechanisms of behavioural change In an era when education programs strive to reach large audiences with varying socioeconomic statuses the designers of such programs increasingly strive to understand the reasons behind behavioural change in order to understand universal characteristics that may be crucial to program design

In fact some of the theories like the social learning theory and theory of planned behaviour were developed as attempts to improve health education Because these theories address the interaction between individuals and their environments they can provide insight into the effectiveness of education programs given a specific set of predetermined conditions like the social context in which a program will be initiated Although health education is still the area in which behavioural change theories are most often applied theories like the stages of change model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education

Empirical studies in criminology support behavioural change theories At the same time the general theories of behavioural change suggest possible explanations to criminal behaviour and methods of correcting deviant behaviour Since deviant behaviour correction entails behavioural change understanding of behavioural change can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policymaking For example the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behaviour can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour

Specific theories that have been applied to criminology include the social learning and differential association theories Social learning theorys element of interaction between an individual and their environment explains the development of deviant behaviour as a function of an individuals exposure to a certain behaviour and their acquaintances who can reinforce either socially acceptable or socially unacceptable behaviour Differential association theory originally formulated by Edwin Sutherland is a popular related theoretical explanation of criminal behaviour that applies learning theory concepts and asserts that deviant behaviour is learned behaviour

Recent years have seen an increased interest in energy consumption reduction based on behavioural change be it for reasons of climate change mitigation or energy security The application of behavioural change theories in the field of energy consumption behaviour yields interesting insights For example it supports criticism of a too narrow focus on individual behaviour and a broadening to include social interaction lifestyles norms and values as well as technologies and policiesall enabling or constraining behavioural change

Besides the models and theories of behavior change there are methods for promoting behavior change Among them one of the most widely used is Tailoring or personalization

Tailoring refers to methods for personalizing communications intended to generate higher behavior change than non personalized ones There are two main claims for why tailoring works Tailoring may improve preconditions for message processing and tailoring may improve impact by altering starting behavioral determinants of goal outcomes The different message processing mechanisms can be summarized into Attention Effortful processing Emotional processing and selfreference 
Behavioral determinants of goal outcomes are the different psychological and social constructs that have a direct influence on behavior The three most used mediators in tailoring are attitude perception of performance and self efficacy Although results are largely positive they are not consistent and more research on the elements that make tailoring work is necessary

Behavioural change theories are not universally accepted Criticisms include the theories emphases on individual behaviour and a general disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour In addition as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for behavioural interventions the theories purposes are not consistent Such criticism illuminates the strengths and weaknesses of the theories showing that there is room for further research into behavioural change theories

Paint Branch High School
Paint Branch High School is a high school located in the Fairland censusdesignated place an unincorporated section of Montgomery County Maryland it has a Burtonsville postal address

It is named after the Paint Branch creek The school was founded in 1969 and is part of the Montgomery County Public Schools System The school lies on Old Columbia Pike between Briggs Chaney and Greencastle Road

Paint Branch once a rural high school now deep in the heart of suburban sprawl is a member of the Northeast Consortium schools in Montgomery County As a member of the Consortium the schools signature program focuses on Science and Media education The panther is the schools mascot and the school song is Hail to the Panthers which is sung to the tune of Hail to the Redskins The schools colors are burgundy and gold also the same as the Washington Redskins

Paint Branch competes in the 4A North division in the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association MPSSAA The Panthers have fielded a total of 22 state championship athletic teams including Girls Basketball 1979 1980 2001 2008 Baseball 1976 1979 1990 1991 Boys Basketball 1977 2000 Wrestling 1978 2001 Boys CrossCountry 1973 1974 Boys Track and Field Indoor 2003 2019 Outdoor 2003 Girls Track and Field Indoor 2009 Outdoor 1989 Field Hockey 2009 Softball 1987 and Football 1975



A new building is now established in the location that the woods next to the football field once occupied As the only school at that time without a new building Paint Branch High School was guaranteed a new building when it was asked to enter the Northeast Consortium back in 1998 The new building was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010 but budget shortfalls pushed that date until April 2012 resulting in the class of 2013 being the first class to graduate from the new building Hess Construction Co was awarded the contract to build the new school Hess Construction Co is also the builder of the Kenmore Middle School in Arlington County Virginia Staff moved into the new building June 18 2012

The old Paint Branch building originally scheduled to be torn down in the summer of 2012 was torn down in October 2012 Sports fields were completed by the 20132014 school year

Efunction
In mathematics Efunctions are a type of power series that satisfy particular arithmetic conditions on the coefficients They are of interest in transcendental number theory and are more special than Gfunctions

A function fx is called of type E or an Efunction if the power series

satisfies the following three conditions

where the left hand side represents the maximum of the absolute values of all the algebraic conjugates of c

The second condition implies that f is an entire function of x

Efunctions were first studied by Siegel in 1929 He found a method to show that the values taken by certain Efunctions were algebraically independentThis was a result which established the algebraic independence of classes of numbers rather than just linear independence Since then these functions have proved somewhat useful in number theory and in particular they have application in transcendence proofs and differential equations

Perhaps the main result connected to Efunctions is the SiegelShidlovsky theorem also known as the Shidlovsky and Shidlovskii theorem named after Carl Ludwig Siegel and Andrei Borisovich Shidlovskii

Suppose that we are given n Efunctions ExEx that satisfy a system of homogeneous linear differential equations
where the f are rational functions of x and the coefficients of each E and f are elements of an algebraic number field K Then the theorem states that if ExEx are algebraically independent over Kx then for any nonzero algebraic number  that is not a pole of any of the f the numbers EE are algebraically independent

Space Empires V
Space Empires V SEV is a 4X turn based strategy game that was released in 2006 It was developed by Malfador Machinations and published by Strategy First The game retains many races and technologies from its predecessor Space Empires IV SEIV

While Space Empires V retains much of its predecessors gameplay there are several key differences It is the first Space Empires game to use threedimensional graphics and as such the user interface has been heavily redesigned New to the series is a 3D realtime combat engine and the player can now control ground combat in addition to the usual space battles The empirebuilding aspects of the game borrows as much from the third instalment as it does from the fourth with research and intelligence being assigned as a percentage of available points as opposed to the queue system used for construction

Virtually all of the stock races with the exception of the Sithrak are updated versions of SEIV races Custom race creation is basically the same as in the previous games with two notable changes  you must now select a government type in addition to a social paradigm and the game master may grant players a set number of research points to improve starting technology As of now there are comparatively few playercreated shipsets arguably a consequence of the switch to 3D graphics

The game received mixed reviews Several have complained that the game is overcomplex and overloads the player with options especially while setting up a new game and that it may not be suitable for players who are new to 4X games One huge bug in the game that frustrated many players initially was the AIs design routine which in early releases would always build only one ship types based on the largest hull available For example if the AI had battleship technology it would build only battleships until a bigger hull size was available

Accelerated Christian Education
Accelerated Christian Education is an American company which produces the Accelerated Christian Education ACE styled by the company as ACE school curriculum structured around a literal interpretation of the Bible and which teaches other academic subjects from a Protestant fundamentalist or conservative Evangelical standpoint Founded in 1970 by Donald and Esther Howard ACEs website states it is used in over 6000 schools in 145 countries ACE has been criticized for its content heavy reliance on the use of rote recall as a learning tool and for the educational outcomes of pupils on leaving the Accelerated Christian Education system both in the US and the United Kingdom

Accelerated Christian Education was founded in 1970 by Drs Donald and Esther Howard They set about developing a biblically literalist educational curriculum with Donald Howard traveling to promote ACE schools around the world as a new form of educational mission

The first school which used the ACE program opened in Garland Texas and started with 45 students By 1980 there were over 3000 Christian schools in the United States associated with ACE reaching 8000 during the 1980s

In 1996 ACE opened a threestory facility in Lewisville Texas to handle its growing operations Esther Howard took over control of ACE the following year She remains as ACEs President and Duane Howard one of the couples sons currently serves as Vice President In 2007 ACE moved its corporate offices to Madison Tennessee eventually moving to Hendersonville Tennessee in 2014 The Lewisville facility remains as ACEs distribution center

According to the curriculum section on its website ACEs core curriculum is an individualized Biblicallybased characterbuilding curriculum package and is based on a series of workbooks called PACEs Packets of Accelerated Christian Education At the beginning of each PACE is an overview a scripture to memorize a character trait to strive toward and information on what if any supplies the student will need Each subject has 12 PACEs per grade level The basic subjects of ACE are math yellow English red Literature  Creative Writing light red Word BuildingEtymology purple science blue social studies green Old and New Testament orange Students in the Philippines also study Filipino pink and Araling Panlipunan brown
A new student is given a placement test and the results place the student at appropriate levels by subject Students are required to set daily goals for work completion and are generally expected to finish a given PACE within two to three weeks depending on the school Students are given reviews at certain points in a PACE called checkups and a test at its culmination The passing score for the test can be from 80 to 90 also depending on the corresponding school Students who fail must take what measures the school provides to pass the PACE

Schools using the curriculum are not allowed to describe themselves as ACE schools or use the ACE logo although schools are expected to sign an agreement and follow the ACE Procedures Manual and Administration Manual

The program can be used by homeschooling families and private establishments ACE provides instruction and structure for operating a Christian school ACEs website advises that schools are not required to use the entire curriculum and may augment it with other resources although this incurs a financial penalty as the school loses its discount

The company also sells home schooling and distance learning curriculum materials through its Lighthouse Christian Academy LCA

ACE provides annual oneday training sessions called Christian Educators Conventions CEC for administrators supervisors and monitors These are provided in locations around the United States The sessions focus on understanding and properly implementing the ACE program For Learning Center Supervisors a fourday workshop is provided annually The workshop is organized like an ACE classroom allowing the supervisor to experience the ACE system as a student and learn how to implement the system

Schools that use the ACE curriculum may participate in the Regional Student Conventions and the topplaced participants are able to proceed to the International Student Convention This convention is usually held at a university campus such as Indiana University in Bloomington 1990 the University of North Texas in Denton 1991 Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff 1993 and Purdue University in Indiana 1994 International Student Conventions have been held at Western Kentucky University 2010 with about 2500 students James Madison University 2011 3000 attending New Mexico State University 2015 2500 participants and Indiana University of Pennsylvania 2017 2200 students The All Africa Student Convention takes place in South Africa once a year at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein South Africa The All Africa Student Convention is not organized or hosted by ACE United States but by Accelerated Christian Education South Africa which is a separate organization providing the ACE curriculum to African schools

The conventions also offer Events of the Heart which allow students with mental and physical disabilities to participate When the conventions first started a parade in the hosting city would accompany a convention In 1981 over 3000 students and sponsors marched in New York City to celebrate the opening of the convention at Rutgers University Student conventions offer speakers past speakers have included David Gibbs from the Christian Law Association Ben Jordan and William Murray

The curriculums emphasis on rote recall has been criticized by educational researchers David Berliner described the teaching methods as lowlevel cognitive tasks that emphasize simple association and recall activities as is typical of instruction from workbooks the materials make heavy use of behavioral objectives programmed learning and rewards D Flemming and T Hunt in a 1987 article in the education journal Phi Delta Kappa analyzed the ACE curriculum concluding that If parents want their children to obtain a very limited and sometimes inaccurate view of the world one that ignores thinking above the level of rote recall then the ACE materials do the job very well The world of the ACE materials is quite a different one from that of scholarship and critical thinking

The ACE curriculum included controversial content in relation to race Social Studies World History PACE 108 stated

Although apartheid appears to allow the unfair treatment of blacks the system has worked well in South Africa  Although white businessmen and developers are guilty of some unfair treatment of blacks they turned South Africa into a modern industrialized nation which the poor uneducated blacks couldnt have accomplished in several more decades If more blacks were suddenly given control of the nation its economy and business as Mandela wished they could have destroyed what they have waited and worked so hard for

ACE Social studies PACE also attempts to play down the role of slavery in the American Civil War stating that God created the war to punish people for religious apostasy

In addition the curriculum has been criticized for its depiction of racially segregated churches and schools

Science is presented in the ACE curriculum through the framework of Young Earth Creationism YEC For example in Biology 1099 the existence of the Loch Ness monster is presented as a fact as a plesiosaur and used as a socalled proof against the theory of evolution Textbooks published in Europe removed the Loch Ness monster reference in July 2013 however children are still only taught creationism as an explanation for the origin of life on earth

Textbooks used in the curriculum assert that abortion is wrong evolution is false and homosexuality is a choice They teach that wives must be subservient to their husbands womens liberation leads to child neglect and that one can avoid AIDS by being abstinent until marriage

The ACE curriculum in Science 1096 asserts that solar fusion is a myth describing it as an invention of evolution scientists

As of January 2017 there are 26 schools using the ACE curriculum registered in the United Kingdom In October 2016 ten schools graded by British parliamentary education inspectors OFSTED were revisited following concerns of mistreatment raised in British press nine of which were subsequently regraded as inadequate or requires improvement by the watchdog In 2018 a further ACE school in London was rated inadequate for failing to teach adequate science and for not teaching children to develop the skills to collect and evaluate scientific evidence

In 2017 research into the International Certificate of Christian Education the schoolleaving qualification provided by ACE in the UK claimed that it failed to prepare students for university level education Professor Michael Reiss of University of London stated My particular problem with ACE is the awful nature of the curriculum they provide to their students The study by Scaramanga and Reiss states that the curriculum fails students as it is heavily based around memorizing information rather than analyzing and understanding it

Having researched comparative performance on the American College Test between public school students from one school and ACE students from another private school in the same geographic area one college student wrote in her thesis in 2005 that a significant difference was found between the public school graduates scores and the ACE graduates scores in all areas of the ACT English Math Reading and Composite Score except the area of Science Reasoning Overall the ACT scores of the ACE graduates were consistently lower than those of the public school students The author also noted that the current study did not account for variables such as socioeconomic status ethnicity gender or parents level of education These variables may impact ACT scores and therefore need to be considered in future research nor was demographic information of the public school used for comparison Furthermore the sample size of graduates from ACE was disproportionately small in this analysis

As of 2019 applicants who completed their Grade 12 or equivalent at the ACE Accelerated Christian Education School of Tomorrow may no longer be accepted to study at the University of South Africa

Ross was the son of Ross II who pitched for the 1951 Chicago White Sox and his wife Judy Robinson Grimsley Ross II a World War II veteran had a long minorleague playing career

The younger Ross Grimsley was a 1969 graduate of Frayser High School in Memphis Tennessee where he was an outstanding basketball and baseball player He attended Jackson State Community College in Jackson Tennessee He was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round 17th pick of the 1969 amateur draft January Secondary

He made his major league debut for the Reds at age 21 on May 16 1971 in a 93 loss to the Expos at Riverfront Stadium He started and took the loss pitched 12 innings and gave up three earned runs The first major league hitter he faced was Ron Hunt In 26 starts that year he posted a record of 107 with a 357 ERA

He followed up with an even better season in 1972 going 148 with a 305 ERA for the National League champion Reds He also had s strong World Series going 21 in four games three in relief with a 257 ERA as the Reds fell to the Oakland Athletics in seven games In 1973 he was 1310 with a 323 ERA as the Reds won the NL West division

Grimsley played for a Reds team that was notorious for conservative rules that governed the appearance and decorum of its players on and off the field Flaunting the team rules with his long hair he ran afoul of manager Sparky Anderson who requested after the 1973 season that Grimsley be traded He along with Wally Williams was sent to the Baltimore Orioles for Merv Rettenmund Junior Kennedy and Bill Wood two months later on December 4

The deal paid off for the Orioles in 1974 as Grimsley went 1813 with 17 complete games in a careerhigh 39 starts as the Orioles were American League East division champions In 1975 and 1976 his totals were down with records of 1013 with a 407 ERA and 87 with a 395 ERA In 1977 he was 1410 with a 396 ERA 

He cashed in on his free agent status by signing a sixyear 11 million contract with the Montreal Expos on December 6 1977 Ironically the Orioles had attempted to trade him to the Expos for Barry Foote prior to the 1977 season Grimsley rewarded the Expos with his best year in 1978 He was named to the 1978 National League AllStar team and finished seventh in voting for the 1978 National League Cy Young Award posting a record of 2011 19 complete games three shutouts 263 innings pitched and a 305 ERA However in 1979 he fell to a record of 109 with a 535 ERA In 1980 he was only 26 with a 631 ERA for the Expos and on July 11 he was traded to the Cleveland Indians for whom he went 45 with a 675 ERA

Grimsley was one of the more colorful players of the 1970s With the Reds he was called into manager Sparky Andersons office and told to stop corresponding with a witch who had been sending him good luck charms Despite being a premier starting pitcher for the Reds he was traded to the Orioles for Merv Rettenmund a parttime outfielder after the 1973 season largely in part for his constant resistance to the Reds organizations conservative grooming rules With the Orioles in 1974 he sported a huge mop of curly hair and prominent moustache

In an incident on September 16 at Fenway Park Grimsley warming up in the Orioles bullpen responded to Boston fans heckling by throwing into the right field bleachers The ball passed through the protective netting injuring a Boston fan The fan later successfully sued Grimsley and the Orioles in Manning v Grimsley a case cited in law casebooks to highlight the scope of employment law as it relates to agency He was accused by Yankees manager Billy Martin in 1977 of throwing spitball pitches using Vaseline hidden in his hair which was usually somewhat greasy in appearance anyway due to Grimsleys penchant for not showering during winning streaks In addition to his nickname Scuz for his liberal grooming habits he was also called Crazy Eyes and known to wear turquoise contact lenses

After his playing career ended he was a minor league instructor for the Orioles Atlanta Braves Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies

Since 1999 Grimsley has been a minorleague pitching coach for the San Francisco Giants He is currently the pitching coach for the AA Richmond Flying Squirrels formerly the Connecticut Defenders

He and his wife live outside of Baltimore

Mount Baker Tunnel
The Mount Baker Tunnel or Mount Baker Ridge Tunnel carries Interstate 90 under the Mount Baker neighborhood of Seattle Washington It is actually a group of three tunnels that carry eight lanes of freeway traffic plus a separate path for bicycles and pedestrians The two originals are twin tunnel bores completed in 1940 and rehabilitated in 1993 The newest tunnel was built north of the original tunnels and opened in June 1989 The tunnel has a doubledecked roadway with the bicyclepedestrian path above the traffic lanes

The tunnel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 ID 82004243 The east portals of the tunnel with murals titled  designed by artist James FitzGerald along with the Lacey V Murrow Bridge are an official City of Seattle landmark

The official length is  though the perceived length while driving is closer to because of a cutandcover lid between the western portal and the beginning of the actual tunnel under the Mount Baker ridge The former west portal now located well inside the tunnel is no longer discernible and its two arch structures were removed during 19891993 modification work The eastern end of the tunnel links to the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge collectively the I90 floating bridge on Lake Washington to Mercer Island

At in diameter it is the worlds largest diameter soft earth tunnel having been bored through clay

When completed in 1940 the twin tunnels connected the I90 floating bridge on Lake Washington and Rainier Avenue South in Seattle The bridge and tunnels were part of US Highway 10 which used surface streets between the tunnels and downtown Seattle US 10 was a fourlane undivided highway Each tunnel held two traffic lanes The north tunnel normally carried two westbound lanes The south tunnel normally carried two eastbound lanes In the 1960s a laneuse signal system was added to improve peak commute traffic During peak commute times the signals were used to make the center two lanes reversible In the mornings three lanes flowed west and one lane flowed east In the evenings three lanes flowed east and one lane flowed west During morning and evening commutes one tunnel carried two lanes of traffic in the same direction while the other tunnel carried opposing traffic separated only by dashed yellow lines

The highway would later become part of Interstate 90 be expanded and upgraded to a controlledaccess freeway The freeway expansion and upgrade was completed in 1993

The expansion included construction of a new parallel tunnel with a larger diameter located north of the original tunnel Construction began in 1983 When the overall I90 project was completed in 1993 the twin 1940 tunnels would be connected to the southern I90 floating bridge the Lacey V Murrow Memorial Bridge and carry eastbound traffic only while the 1989 tunnel would be connected to the northern floating bridge the thennew Homer M Hadley Memorial Bridge and be westboundonly for general traffic

The original pair of tunnels were each in diameter while the new tunnel was in diameter The new tunnel was built to carry traffic on three levels two lanes for buses and carpools on the bottom level three lanes of general traffic on the middle level and cyclists and pedestrians on the top level Excavation was completed in 1986 and the new tunnel opened to traffic in June 1989 Although designed to carry only westbound traffic the new tunnel and thennew Homer Hadley Memorial Bridge temporarily carried all traffic  in both directions  when opened in 1989 while work continued on modifying the old Mercer Island Bridge where it connected to the 1940 Murrow Bridge and on rehabilitation of the latter 

The new tunnel opened to westbound traffic on June 4 1989 and to eastbound traffic on June 23 On the latter date the old tunnel and floating bridge closed to all traffic for renovation that was originally expected to take three years When a long section of the Murrow Bridge sank during a storm in 1990 the reopening was delayed by about one year until 1993
With the reopening of the Murrow Bridge in 1993 the older Mount Baker Ridge tunnel also reopened with all of its lanes now eastboundonly Instead of carrying two traffic lanes in each tunnel the reconfigured lanes in the twin 1940 tunnels comprised two lanes of eastbound traffic in the northern tunnel and one lane of eastbound traffic in the southern tunnel and with pedestrians no longer permitted because of the exclusive pedestrian and bicycle facilities now provided in the parallel new tunnel A second eastbound lane was later reinstated in the northern tunnel The reversible lanes in the older tunnels had been separated only by painted lines on the roadway surface but the reversible lanes on the rebuilt and expanded freeway which use only the newer 1989 tunnel are separated by concrete barriers to improve safety 

The I90 expansion project also effectively more than doubled the length of the Mt Baker Tunnel The west portal of the twin 1940 tunnels which had been located near 29th Avenue South was removed and a concrete lid was built over the freeway covering the section between the old west portal and west end of the lid just west of 23rd Avenue South However officially the lid is not considered to be part of the tunnel and a 1993 Historic American Engineering Record survey stated that the lengths of the two 1940 tunnels remain each Inside the older tunnels which had been archshaped the ceiling and walls were made square matching the shape of the lidded section Equipment to boost radio reception was added

Upon completion of the Interstate 90 expansion program in the 1990s the freeway capacity increased to three generalpurpose lanes in each direction and two reversible HOV lanes Eastbound traffic uses the original tunnels Westbound traffic uses the upper deck of the northern new tunnel A twolane reversible roadway uses the lower deck The reversible roadway served as express lanes for transit buses and carpools 2 people during peak commute periods until 2017 The express lanes flowed westbound on weekday mornings and eastbound on weekday afternoons and evenings On weekends the express lanes were open traffic direction was variable depending on anticipated traffic volumes When the express lanes were open to eastbound traffic singleoccupant vehicles headed to Mercer Island are allowed to use the lanes per an interlocal agreement signed in 1976

Above the westbound traffic is the I90 Trail tunnel At  it is the longest nonadapted trail tunnel in the world On the western half the trail emerges onto the lid and uses trails in Lid Park

In 2017 the Washington State Department of Transportation added a pair of highoccupancy vehicle lanes HOV lanes to Interstate 90 from Seattle to Bellevue replacing the reversible express lanes The express lanes were closed in June 2017 for the construction of the East Link light rail project which will extend Link light rail service from Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond in 2023 On Mercer Island WSDOT and Sound Transit are building direct access ramps to allow buses and HOVs to exit and enter I90 from the HOV lanes

McCloy received a Meritorious Unit Commendation MUC for unsurpassed ASW accomplishments from 8 June to 22 December 1982 during this deployment She also received the Sixth Fleet Hook Em Award and was designated as the Best ASW Ship in the Atlantic Fleet during the period 1 October 1980 to 31 March 1982 by Commander Naval Surface Force US Atlantic Fleet Following this highly successful Med deployment McCloy again conducted Special ASW Operations in the Western Atlantic Bermuda Box environment

On 31 October 1983 McCloy snagged the  a Soviet Victor IIIclass nuclearpowered attack submarine with her towed array causing damage to the submarines propeller The submarine was towed to Cienfuegos Cuba for repairs by a Soviet salvage ship beginning on 5 November 1983

In the late 1980s McCloy was involved in drug interdiction operations in the Caribbean Sea with a United States Coast Guard law enforcement detachment on board She was involved in several large drug busts including a 50ton marijuana seizure from the vessel Sea Wanderer in November 1986

On 27 April 1988 McCloy assisted submarine rescue vessel and salvage ship in conducting rescue operations following a fire on submarine 

McCloy was decommissioned on 14 December 1990 stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 17 December 1990 and transferred to Mexico on 1 October 1993 along with her sister ship  In the Mexican Navy McCloy was renamed ARM Nicols Bravo E40 for Nicols Bravo a Mexican politician and soldier As of June 2010 Nicols Bravo was still in service with the Mexican Navy

USS Richard L Page
USS Richard L Page FFG5 was a Brooke class frigate in the United States Navy

Richard L Page was laid down on 4 January 1965 by the Bath Iron Works Bath Maine She was launched on 4 April 1966 sponsored by Miss Edmonia Lee Whittle and Mrs Nannie Page Trinker granddaughters of the ships namesake Brigadier General Richard L Page and commissioned as a guided missile destroyer escort at Boston Massachusetts on 5 August 1967 with the hull number DEG5 Commander Milton J Schultz Jr USN in command

In midOctober 1967 Richard L Page moved from Boston to her homeport of Naval Station Newport Rhode Island then sailed south for shakedown exercises in the Caribbean On 21 December 1967 she returned to Newport and after postshakedown availability began operations with Escort Squadron SIX CORTRON 6 Into 1968 she operated in the western Atlantic and in the fall she deployed to the Mediterranean for duty with the 6th Fleet On that duty until 10 February 1969 she returned to Newport on 18 February and in March 1969 resumed operations with the 2nd Fleet On 1 July 1969 she relieved as flagship of Destroyer Division ONE TWODESRON 12 then conducted exercises in the Caribbean

Richard L Page spent all of 1971 and the first eight months of 1972 in port at Newport and in operations along the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean In midAugust 1972 she steamed out of Newport bound for an extended deployment with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean

From 1973 to 1975 she was forward deployed to Athens Greece and on 30 June 1975 she was reclassified as a guided missile frigate with the new hull number of FFG5 Returning from Europe Richard L Page underwent a yearlong modernization overhaul returning to the Atlantic Fleet and a new homeport of Naval Station Norfolk Virginia in 1976 Over the next four years she repeatedly deployed to the Mediterranean Middle East the eastern coast of Africa and Northern Europe interspersed with brief periods in her stateside homeport of Norfolk

During this same four year period in 1979 Richard L Page was the recipient of both the Battle Efficiency E that year from Commander Naval Surface Force Atlantic designating her as the best guided missile frigate among all guided missile frigates in the US Atlantic Fleet and the Battenberg Cup designating her as the surface warship with the highest operational excellence of any warship in the entire US Atlantic Fleet

In early 1980 she temporarily relocated to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard where she received various sonar and electronic warfare system upgrades before returning to the Fleet in August 1980 She then completed independent operations in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and following completion of Refresher Training REFTRA at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Cuba returned to Norfolk to participate in Exercise SOLID SHIELD 81 During the rest of 1981 she operated as a unit of Standing NATO Maritime Group 1Standing Naval Force Atlantic

Deploying in late 1983 she joined the carrier battle group deploying to both the Mediterranean where she supported both the US 6th Fleet and multinational peacekeeping forces in Lebanon and to the North Atlantic and Norway as part of Cold War operations as a deterrent force to the Red Banner Northern Fleet of the Soviet Navy Following her return to Norfolk in 1984 Richard L Page underwent another yard period overhaul at Bath Iron Works in Maine before returning to the Fleet from 1986 In 1987 with the acquisition of the newer Oliver Hazard Perry class guided missile frigates nearly complete a decision was made to retire the entire Brooke class of frigates from the US Navy in 1988 and 1989 and earmark them for transfer to a foreign navy

Richard L Page remained in US naval service until decommissioned on 30 September 1988 Earlier in 1982 the Reagan administration approved a US32 billion military and economic aid package to Pakistan As part of that package Pakistan acquired Richard L Page on a fiveyear lease in 1989 On 31 March 1989 she was leased to Pakistan recommissioned in the Pakistani Navy and renamed PNS Tabuk D163

However as a result of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989 President George H W Bush was advised a few months later to no longer certify that Pakistan was not involved in the development of nuclear weapons in accordance with the Pressler Amendment which banned most economic and military assistance to Pakistan unless the President certified on an annual basis that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device and that the proposed United States assistance program will reduce significantly the risk that Pakistan will possess a nuclear explosive device The Pressler Amendment was subsequently invoked on 1 October 1990 The lease of the ship expired in March 1994 and she was returned to United States control that same month

As a result the ship was struck from the Navy Vessel Register on 12 January 1994 and transferred to the Maritime Administration MARAD for disposal on 28 March 1994 On 29 March 1994 the exRichard L Page was returned to the US Navy acting as executive agent for the MARAD at Singapore and sold to Trusha Investments Pte Ltd co Jacques Pierot Jr  Sons Inc New York City NY for 62685000 for eventual scrapping

During her service with the US Navy Richard L Page was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation the Meritorious Unit Commendation with 1 bronze star 2 awards the Navy E Ribbon 2 awards the Navy Expeditionary Medal the National Defense Service Medal the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon

The ship and crew was also the 1979 recipient of the Battenberg Cup

guilas del Zulia
The guilas del Zulia  is a Venezuelan professional baseball team based in Maracaibo which plays in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League

The team was founded in 1969 and debuted in the 196970 season The franchise began in 1946 as Sabios de Vargas then was renamed Santa Marta BBC in 1954 before moving to Valencia and plays as the Industriales de Valencia from 195556 through 196768 The Industriales later moved to Acarigua and were renamed Llaneros de Acarigua for the 196869 season

After the collapse of the Liga Occidental de Bisbol Profesional in 1963 the Zulia state was left without a professional baseball team In the following years there were many efforts to bring baseball back to the state but the efforts were not realized until 1969 when the guilas del Zulia joined the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League Two baseball people were behind the formation of the team Luis Rodolfo Machado B main shareholder of the extinct Centauros de Maracaibo club and Juan Antonio Yanes former Patriotas de Venezuela owner

Machado found a group of local investors to buy the aforementioned Llaneros de Acarigua when the team folded after their only season in the VPBL By then the Acarigua team was put up for sale by its owners after losing money for numerous years including the hazardous Valencia Industriales experience Among the investors were Simn Bromberg Rubn Daro Barboza Gabriel Fernndez Edgardo Fuenmayor Arrieta Guillermo Echeto La Roche Sixto Mrquez Jos Trinidad Martnez Douglas Mavrez Granadillo Ernesto Montiel Fernando Prez Amado Vinicio Pineda Gil Alberto Plumacher Antonio Quintero Parra Lucas Rincn Colmenares Heberto Rutilio Ros and Hugo Surez Romero

After receiving the approval of the VPBL President Franklin White and from the five other teams the franchise was formally acquired by Machados group The team was bought for a sum of 400000 million bolivars The news of the return of professional baseball to the state was celebrated in Zulia

The team made its official debut on October 14 1969 at Estadio Antonio Herrera Gutirrez against the Cardenales de Lara The guilas lost the game 32 with Juan Quiroz pitching a complete game loss while Pablo Torrealba was credited with the win and Ken Sanders earned the save On the following day the team played and won its first game at Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande

The Aguilas first years were troubled while posting losing records in most seasons Nevertheless the team survived these lean years to become one of the most successful VPBL teams in the early 1980s winning five championship titles spanning 19842000

The teams name of the guilas Eagles is associated with the Zuliano region It is said to be attributed to the Father Jose Manuel Ros In 1968 during a baseball game at Estadio Alejandro Borges in Maracaibo Machado had asked Ros if he had any suggestions for a baseball teams name as he had just bought the Llaneros de Portuguesa According to Machado Ros saw the label of the then popular Cerveza Zulia Zulia beer  whose bottles label carried a blue eagle on a yellow background  and said that the guilas would be a good name for the team In addition Ros explained the Governmental Palace in Maracaibo is called El de las guilas The Place of the Eagles and that many national flags and coats of arms have eagles on them Thus the teams name became the guilas

For the first time in five seasons the team qualified to the postseason managed by former major league catcher John Russell The performances of the rookie sensation and Arizona Diamondbacks outfield prospect Carlos Gonzlez led this rookiefilled team to a successful year finishing second in the western division and third in the playoff race to the finals

Foreign pitchers Chris Begg Heath Totten and Jeremy Cummings were the heads of the pitching rotation while the offensive was commanded by an MVP season by Gonzlez solid catching work of Humberto Quintero and the performances of Juan Pablo Camacho Orlando Muoz and Luis Bolvar who was named Rookie of the Year

Reliever Richard Garcs reached his 100th save in the league which inspired his rookie pitcher teammates while another Aguilas legend former pitcher Wilson lvarez joined the team as their bullpen coach

Jujutsu techniques
Jujutsu techniques include joint locks chokeholds strikes grappling throwing and other selfdefense techniques

Major categories of jujutsu techniques include but are not limited to joint locks chokeholds strikes grappling throwing and takedowns

Joint locks can be applied on anything that bends such as fingers wrists elbows shoulders or knees Application of locks might include gaining purchase for throwing techniques encouraging cooperation submission or restraining an aggressor Such techniques are taught to police forces Locks can also be utilised for interrogationtorture or controlling a prisoner prior to securing him using rope In modern sporting contests bouts are often concluded upon a submission resulting from a successful joint lock

Chokeholds including gichokesstrangulations with the lapel and nogi Used primarily to kill or knock unconscious In combat a choking technique might permanently dissociate the windpipe from the ligament supporting it causing death by asphyxiation Strangulation techniques may also be used for nonlethal subduing of an opponent Fully blocking the bloodflow to the brain will knock an opponent unconscious in 3 to 7 seconds To kill by strangulation would take just over a minute before brain death occurs In modern competition chokes are normally banned although they are permitted in judo competition Strangulation is more popular in competition as they can be applied without fatal consequence so full leverage can be applied to aid restraining of the competitor In Jujutsu there are many counters to choking or strangling attacks This may have contributed to Jujutsus popularity in selfdefence applications

Strikes are generally taught though the specific strike preferences vary by system In Jujutsu all known striking techniques are available as tools nothing is excluded by doctrine It is the application of those tools that distinguishes different systems of Jujutsu 

nowiki nowikiJujutsu emphasises the control of an opponents balance and therefore most systems of Jujutsu do not advocate any kicks targeted above the Celiac plexus 

Atemi is the art of striking pressure points or physiological targets for kuzushi breaking balance or to incapacitate an opponent Atemi is the art of striking the human body in order to cause specific physiological effect for various applications The term atemi is sometimes applied to any technique whose primary purpose is to distract an opponent setting the opponent up for another technique

Grappling techniques are also common Simple grappling was incorporated into early Jujutsu systems for use in combat More elaborate grappling techniques and strategies were likely developed for use in sporting contests in the ancient world Such techniques have been reintroduced into the Japanese martial arts in postreformation systems such as Judo and related Brazilian jiujitsu systems In postreformation Japan Japanese martial arts were altered under the auspices of Kan Jigor and his contemporaries The emphasis on Samurai combat skills was degraded in preference to systems that could be practiced by anyone of any age for healthy physical education sport and selfdefense Because of this new emphasis grappling skills have been adapted to safe sporting environments where gouging biting and other unsporting techniques are banned Only a few schools maintain the old samurai grappling techniques and training practices The majority of schools utilise Judo training or a more combative form of grappling

Takedown is a term for a technique that involves offbalancing an opponent and bringing him or her to the ground typically with the combatant performing the takedown landing on top Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by the forward motion and target of advancement typically the legs although in some systems of terminology throwing techniques are a type of takedown

There are differences in application of the same technique between styles of Jujutsu that range from the minor to the major

When performing a forward shoulder roll some styles roll on the back of the leadhand ie palm up and some roll palmdown While performing a backward shoulder roll land on your far side hip palm down

Some styles perform wrist locks or peels with the bottom 3 fingers and dont use the index finger and some use the top 3 fingers keep the pinky off The intent of both approaches is the same do not block the opponents wrist during a peel

Some styles advocate using live hand hand open for an armbar takedown whereas some advocate making a fist Adherents of each approach claim more power though the closedfist approach arguably offers the additional benefit of reducing the possibility of a finger getting accidentally snagged

On a hip throw off the right hip for example the most common way this throw is taught is to grab the ukes right arm with the left hand Some styles however teach wrapping the ukes right arm with the left instead of the grab Biomechanically the most effective method is to grab the right upper arm using a monkey style grip Using this method one grips the opponents left arm using the 4 fingers and the thumb against the palm instead of gripping with the thumb against the 4 fingers The reason for using this grip rather than a normal human gripping action is that the thumb gripping against the 4 fingers is weaker in strength than the grip applied by the 4 fingers and thumb against the palm as monkeys do when gripping the branch of a tree to swing Grabbing the upper arm rather than the wrist allows the body greater pulling torque

Likewise on hip throws some systems grab around the waist or in ignorance the belt and some systems prefer to wrap toris right arm under the ukes left One should never grip the opponents belt modern attire may not include a belt In fact grabbing the belt is not necessary Simply grabbing around the waist so long as the grip is all the way around the waist works better anyway One should note that it feels easier to grab your opponents waist with your right arm than it does wrapping your right arm around their left arm Biomechanically grabbing the opponent higher up the back such as at the shoulder can allow the opponent to bend at the waist making the hip throw more difficult The sequence of actions required for the hip throw is block parry or deflect the opponents punch if necessary effect kuzushi bend the knees and turn whilst pulling the opponent over your hip

The biggest conceptual difference is when grappling is taught whether a style views grappling as a sport or grappling as a necessity of balanced selfdefense training or both Both applications have merit and the training will have a considerable amount of overlap but will also have important differences The latter approach will need to understand the fundamentals of the grappling positional hierarchy like the former but the priority will be to get off the ground and get away as fast as possible It is also a very good technique to use when near an opponent

Shire of Beverley
The Shire of Beverley is a local government area in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia about southeast of Perth the state capital The Shire covers an area of  starting outside Armadale in the Darling Scarp and extending eastwards beyond the scarp into agricultural lands which support broad acre activities such as livestock and cropping Its seat of government is the town of Beverley which accommodates just over half of the Shires population

In 1871 the Beverley Road District was established with immense boundaries taking in land all the way east to Eucla on the South Australian border Its scope was so broad that from 1892 to 1913 the town of Beverley had its own municipal council operating separately from the Road Board However over the years each of the major towns were granted their own road boards and by 1923 the present boundaries were established In 1961 the Road District was renamed the Shire of Beverley

The Shire is divided into three wards which became effective on 2 May 1987


Prior to 1986 the Shire was represented by eight councillors across four wards which had existed in some form since the amalgamation of the Municipal District in 1913

South African Class GL 482284
The South African Railways Class GL 482284 of 1929 was an articulated steam locomotive

In 1929 and 1930 the South African Railways placed eight Garratt articulated steam locomotives with a 482284 Double Mountain type wheel arrangement in service Built at Beyer Peacock and Companys Gorton Foundry they were originally designed to work on the Durban to Cato Ridge section of the Natal mainline The Class GL was eventually displaced to the route between Glencoe and Vryheid before spending their final working years operating on the line from Stanger to Empangeni

The Class GL had its origin in the steady increase in loads experienced by the Natal mainline in the years prior to the First World War The old Natal mainline had gradients of 1 in 30 3 whilst the newer line relocated to provide an easier route still had of nearuninterrupted 1 in 66 1 gradients Moreover the tight curvature of the line with curves of as little as radius precluded the use of large long wheelbased nonarticulated locomotives and restricted them to a coupled wheelbase of  These factors combined with everincreasing train weights ensured that the line rapidly became a bottleneck

The decision to electrify the line from Glencoe Junction to Durban had been taken in 1914 coincidentally the year in which the South African Railways SAR ordered its first Cape gauge Garratt the Class GA Electrification was placed in abeyance along with the delivery of the Class GA until the end of the First World War

Despite this delay the process of electrification began in earnest in 1922 and by 1926 full electrified haulage had been instituted between Glencoe and Pietermaritzburg with lashups of three electric locomotives being used on the heaviest freights These trains were then hauled onward to Durban by a pair of Class 14 482 steam locomotives

The success of the Class GA Garratt in proving the suitability of the Garratt design for South African conditions coupled with the economies in crew fuel and water consumption it offered provided an incentive for the SAR to consider a new Garratt class for use on the Natal mainline The aim was to eliminate doubleheading as a regular practice with such a locomotive to be equivalent to three of the Class 1E electric locomotives which were then in use or two Class 14 steam locomotives

Colonel FR Collins DSO the Chief Mechanical Engineer CME of the SAR from 1922 to 1929 prepared the specifications and the contract for the design and construction of these locomotives the Class GL was awarded to Beyer Peacock and Company BP The locomotive was to be approximately equal to two Class 14 locomotives in power output with a maximum permitted axle loading of owing to the use of rail on both sections of the mainline and a maximum allup weight of 

Since these locomotives would be some 48 larger and more powerful than any locomotive previously employed on the SAR and up to twice the track gauge in width the initial order was for two prototype locomotives only with more to follow should they prove successful They were delivered in September 1929 and were erected in the Durban shops numbered 2350 and 2351 and placed in service in October They proved to be so successful that the remaining six locomotives were quickly ordered for delivery in 1930 These six entered service in July 1930 numbered in the range from 2352 to 2357

At the time they were the most powerful steam locomotives to be placed in service anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere and attained the objective of constructing a locomotive to approximately equal the power output of two Class 14 locomotives Bishop Natal Locomotive Superintendent took part in the design process and successfully carried out the initial tests On their first test run despite the cutoff on these locomotives being limited to 65 were hauled from Durban to Cato Ridge in 163 minutes compared to in 184 minutes for a Class 14 Moreover this was achieved on half throttle and with the cutoff set at 45

This suggested that the Class GL had still more to give which was confirmed on the following days testing when a load of was hauled over the same stretch of track As a result of these tests the further six Class GL locomotives were ordered for delivery in 1930 Apart from demonstrating the Class GLs power and capacity for hauling heavy trains these tests also showed that their running qualities were exceptional being smooth and freerunning machines In many ways the Class GL set a design standard which was followed later in the Class GM Class GMA and Class GO

The Class GL embodied comparatively few features of any particular novelty Instead they were designed to make the best possible use of existing technologies to produce a locomotive of great power efficiency and reliability Their allup weight of coupled with their axle loading closely matched the limits laid down by the SAR and was considered by Lionel Wiener author of Articulated Locomotives to show such mastery in general and detail design that we have pleasure on congratulating Messrs Beyer Peacock  Co on this achievement Their tractive effort of at 75 of boiler pressure remained the highest of any locomotive on the SAR for the duration of the steam era

The main frames were thick cut bar frames On the SAR the bar frame had previously only been employed on the Germanbuilt Class GCA 262262 Garratt

The Class GL made use of Beyer Peacocks standard leveractuated Sterlingtype steamoperated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbogenerator The piston valves were modern straightported types with longlap longtravel valves used for the first time in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very freerunning and more efficient than its predecessors The cylinders of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14 drove the third coupled axles using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum This method of design became the standard on most BeyerGarratts thereafter

To allow for the tight curves including radius bends with superelevation without any intermediate tangent and the steep twisting nature of the line the front engine units pivot bearing was spherical with its alignment controlled by sprung rollers The rear pivot was the usual Beyer Peacock flat adjustable type

The boiler was of exceptional size with an inside diameter of  double the track gauge It used a top feed and contained 263 small tubes of outside diameter and 50 large tubes of outside diameter while the superheater elements were of diameter The roundtopped firebox with its grate area was fired by a duplex mechanical stoker the only class on the SAR which had this feature The firebox contained two Nicholson thermic syphons and two arch tubes Clyde Superior soot blowers were fitted on each side of the firebox Beyer Peacock estimated the Class GL locomotives economical coal consumption rate at per hour
The Class GL had a rocking grate and selfcleaning hopper ashpan with water and steam sprayers to dampen down the ash to prevent it from entering axle boxes motion areas and other frictionsensitive places They had selfcleaning type smokeboxes and their axle boxes were greaselubricated

The locomotives were equipped with a Sturtevant powered fan blower to supply fresh air to the cab sucked from ahead of the chimney and driven by a steam turbine in deference to the eleven tunnels on this section which totalled to almost  the longest being the Shongweni tunnel at  This proved less than satisfactory as did the smoke deflecting cowls over the chimneys of the second batch of locomotives These cowls were controlled by steamoperated cylinders and when not required could be withdrawn longitudinally from the position over the chimney orifice Since Garratts are designed to be bidirectional the problem was eventually solved by simply running them with the chimney trailing on the ascending legs of the tunneled routes

Owing to limitations in the length of sidings and crossing loops the Class GLs allowed loads were originally from Durban to Cato Ridge and coastward despite having shown themselves capable of greater loads They were eventually marshalled to standard loads of between to correspond with the load which could be hauled by a lashup of three electric locomotives
During April 1931 no 2351 hauled a special train conveying the GovernorGeneral of South Africa His Excellency the Earl of Athlone and Princess Alice The GovernorGeneral and the Princess travelled on the footplate from Cato Ridge to Umlaas and expressed keen delight at the experience which led to the Princess granting the SAR permission to name the locomotive on which she had travelled after her The name plates were affixed to the cabsides above the number plates

In 1947 no 2352 was the Garratt selected to haul the Royal Train between Glencoe and Piet Retief while sister engine no 2355 hauled the pilot train over the same section

Upon completion of the electrification project between Durban and Pietermaritzburg in 1938 the eight locomotives were transferred from the Durban section to the gruelling run between Glencoe and Vryheid with the latters coal trains This work entailed the regular haulage of up gradients of 1 in 50 taxing the Class GL even more heavily than the work for which it was designed Despite this they maintained an effective service along this line until its electrification in 1968

The Class GL was then transferred from Glencoe to work the line between Stanger and Empangeni in the late 1940s However since the loads on this route did not fully justify the use of the powerful Class GL while their great weight and high axle loading restricted them to mainlines laid with heavy rail they were eventually replaced by less powerful more modern and more economical Class GMA locomotives Though briefly considered as hump shunters at Bloemfontein the Class GL had outlasted its use and after some fortytwo years of working the most difficult terrain on the SAR they were withdrawn from service in 1972

Of the eight locomotives only the first two survived No 2351 Princess Alice is preserved at the Outeniqua Transport Museum in George 

No 2352 was allocated to the National Collection of the South African Railway Museum It was staged at Greyville Loco in Durban at the time and the Loco Foreman at Greyville was asked to prepare the engine for haulage up to Germiston Loco where it was intended to stage the engine His response was that no engine would leave his Depot under haulage and that he would have it prepared to steam and travel up to Germiston under its own power which it did in due course

The development of the planned new museum was shelved indefinitely however and the condition of the locomotive gradually deteriorated where it stood at Germiston Some eight years later in 1983 the Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester after failing to acquire the East African Railways 59 class 5930 Mount Shengena because of shipping costs
asked if they could acquire the engine for display in their institution since it had been built in that city by Beyer  Peacock This request was granted and with the help of shipping sponsors it arrived back in Manchester By the time it was shipped to England it was shorn of around two hundred parts including its righthandside ashpan and much of its brick arch

The main picture shows no 2351 Princess Alice c 1930 The smoke deflecting cowl on the chimney installed for tunnel working was later removed

Jack the Writer
Jack the Writer is the fourth episode of the first season of the American situation comedy 30 Rock which aired on November 1 2006 on the NBC network in the United States and on November 1 2007 in the United Kingdom The episode was written by Robert Carlock and was directed by Gail Mancuso Guest stars in this episode include Katrina Bowden Keith Powell Maulik Pancholy Tom Broecker Jonathan Lutz James Anderson and Sharon Wilkins

The episode focuses on the relationship between Liz Lemon Tina Fey head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan and Jack Donaghy Alec Baldwin her boss and the distractions the writers of TGS face when writing sketches This becomes evident when Lizs assistant Cerie Katrina Bowden wears sexually suggestive clothing and when Jack decides to join the writers for observation Kenneth Parcell Jack McBrayer learns that working for Tracy Jordan Tracy Morgan the main star of TGS is more than he expected

The staff are preparing to write sketches for TGS with Tracy Jordan when Jack arrives and announces that he went through a program at General Electric GE called Six Sigma which encourages bosses to interact with their staff He tells Liz and the writers that he will be sitting in the writers room every day as an observer As days pass Jack begins to interfere with the writers work and instead of just being an observer he regularly gives the writers ideas for upcoming sketches This causes a major frustration for the staff so Liz tells Jack that the writers do not like his involvement Jack says that although he enjoyed joining the writers every day he tells Liz that he accepts their decision

Afterwards Jacks secretary tells Liz that Jack wants her to apologize but that she has to pretend that it was her idea Liz goes to Jacks office and apologizes and they forgive each other While the staff eats their lunch Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends Liz asks Jack but he denies the request He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE and then criticizes Liz and her staff He apologizes to Liz but she says that their friendship is over Having settled the situation with Jack Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire which seems to distract the writers Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative but Cerie tells Liz that she would look great in something sexy herself and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads Dirty Diva

Kenneth who is now working for Tracy learns that working for Tracy is more than he expected Tracy orders Kenneth to complete several tasks including going to the Yankee Stadium for nachos and picking up an important package which turns out to be an illegal fish that Tracy wants to put in his aquarium Tracy then tells Kenneth to buy something for his wife Angie Jordan Sharon Wilkins and to take her to a fancy restaurant where he gives her Tracys gift

30 Rock and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip both of which debuted on 200607 NBC lineup revolved around the offcamera happenings on a sketch comedy series Evidence of the overlapping subject matter between the shows as well as the conflict between them arose when Aaron Sorkin the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week a request Michaels denied Despite this Sorkin sent Fey flowers after NBC announced it would pick up both series and wished her luck with 30 Rock Fey wound up winning over Sorkin when Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was cancelled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second Though 30 Rocknowikinowikis first season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip the latter was more expensive to produce Jack the Writer contains a selfreferencing walk and talk sequence which is commonly used on Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and Sorkins previous series

Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger Scott Adsit and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia for several Halloweens Fey a fan of Star Wars herself said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference started happening organically when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference in almost every show Fey said that from then on it became a thing where they tried to keep it going and that even though they could not include one in every episode they still had a pretty high batting average Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock who she described as the resident expert In this episode Liz repeatedly uses analogies from Star Wars for her situation with Jack when she realizes that she needs to get new DVDs

According to the Nielsen ratings system Jack the Writer was watched by approximately 461million American viewers ranking eightyfirst in the weekly charts The episode received a rating of 175 in the key adults 1849 demographic The 17 refers to 17 of all 18 to 49yearolds and the 5 refers to 5 of all 18 to 49yearolds watching television at the time of the broadcast In the United Kingdom the episode attracted 500000 viewers and a 4 share of the viewing audience at the time of the broadcast

Robert Canning of IGN felt that while the episode was still an entertaining halfhour there was nothing to it that was incredibly memorable He said that Tracy Jordan was quickly becoming one of the more enjoyable aspects of the show Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide felt that this outing fell a bit flat for him He thought that the best moment this week by far had to be that big fat wink to Aaron Sorkins Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip and West Wing and Sports Night  where Liz and Pete upon realizing that they had traveled in a small circle over the course of a banter exchange shrugged and said Nice walkandtalk and then bumped fists Nice

Lost time
Lost time is the term within traffic engineering for the time during which no vehicles are able to pass through an intersection despite the traffic signal displaying a green go signal The total lost time is the sum of two separate elements startup lost time and clearance lost time Startup lost time happens when a traffic signal changes from red stop to green go Some amount of time elapses between the signal changing from red to green and the first queued vehicle moving through the intersection There is then an additional amount of time for the next vehicle to begin moving and pass through the intersection and so on The total time taken for all waiting drivers to react and accelerate is the startup lost time Clearance lost time is the time lost to stopping a line of vehicles at the end of a green phase Lost time is always measured in seconds

Startup lost time can be calculated as the sum of the differences between the headways for the first cars in line and the average headway through the intersection at a theoretical maximum flow the saturation flow rate When no observations have been made the startup lost time is assumed to be 20 seconds as a default value

Since clearance lost time is often not observable since observation requires that some vehicles which were waiting at the start of a green phase still be waiting when the green phase ends it is typically determined through the equation 
formula1 where formula2 is the clearance lost time formula3 is the yellow time formula4 is the allred interval time during which the traffic signal is red for all directions and formula5 is the portion of the yellow and allred times during which vehicles are illegally in the intersection and has a default value of 20 seconds in HCM ALDOTs Traffic Signal Design Guide and Timing Manual on the other hand determines clearance lost time to be half of the yellow interval plus the entire allred interval

In order to find out how clearance lost time can be calculated see and In this study clearance lost time was measured in the field and compared with the default values specified in HCM and ALDOTs manual

Carolyn Kizer
Carolyn Ashley Kizer December 10 1925  October 9 2014 was an American poet of the Pacific Northwest whose works reflect her feminism She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1985

According to an article at the Center for the Study of the Pacific Northwest Kizer reached into mythology in poems like Semele Recycled into politics into feminism especially in her series of poems called Pro Femina into science the natural world music and translations and commentaries on Japanese and Chinese literatures

Kizer was born in Spokane Washington the daughter of a socially prominent Spokane couple

Her father Benjamin Hamilton Kizer who was 45 when she was born was a successful attorney Her mother Mabel Ashley Kizer was a professor of biology who had received her doctorate from Stanford University

Kizer was once asked if she agreed with a description of her father as someone who came across as supremely structured intelligent polite but always somewhat remote Her reply Add authoritarian and severe and you get a pretty good approximation of how he appeared to that stranger his child At times she related her father gave her the same viscerashriveling voice she heard him use later on members of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and other villains of the 50s to even more devastating effect and she added I almost forgave him

After graduating from Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane she went on to get her bachelors degree from Sarah Lawrence College where she studied comparative mythologies with Joseph Campbell in 1945 and study as a graduate at both Columbia University 194546 and the University of Washington 194647

She then moved back to Washington state and in 1946 married Charles Stimson Bullitt an attorney from a wealthy and influential Seattle family with whom she had three children Fred Nemo Jill Bullitt and Ashley Bullitt In 1954 she enrolled in a creative writing workshop run by poet Theodore Roethke Kizer had three small kids a big house on North Capitol Hill enough money to get by and more than enough talent and determination And although one of her poems had been published in The New Yorker when she was 17 she remembers that she needed a nudge from Roethke to get serious
Her marriage to Bullitt ended in divorce in 1954
In 1959 she helped found Poetry Northwest and served as its editor until 1965

She was a Specialist in Literature for the US State Department in Pakistan 19651966 during which she taught for several months in that country 
In 1966 she became the first director of Literary Programs for the newly created National Endowment for the Arts She resigned that post in 1970 when the NEA chairman Roger L Stevens was fired by President Richard Nixon She was a consultant to the NEA for the following year

In the 1970s and 1980s she held appointments as poetinresidence or lecturer at universities across the country including Columbia Stanford Princeton San Jose State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill She has been a visiting writer at literary conferences and events across the country as well as in Dublin Ireland and Paris Kizer was also a member of the faculty of the Iowa Writers Workshop

She was appointed to the post of Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1995 but resigned three years later to protest the absence of women and minorities on the governing board

Kizer was married to the architecthistorian John Marshall Woodbridge When she was not teaching and lecturing she divided her time between their home in Sonoma California and their apartment in Paris

Ford Falcon Cobra
The Cobra was a limited edition pony car of the Ford Falcon released by Ford Australia in 1978 It was based on the XC Hardtop Coupe

In 1978 Ford Australia unveiled plans for an allnew Falcon dubbed the XD that would be released in 1979 Unlike the current XC the new model would be offered only as a fourdoor sedan or station wagon meaning the twodoor XC Hardtops of 1978 would be the last of that design

In December 1977 Ford built 13 special order XC Falcon GS Hardtops with VINs beginning JG65TE These cars were specially modified in the PA Parts and Accessories workshop at Fords Campbellfield factory All vehicles were modified to accord with evolution upgrades that had been approved by CAMS for homologation to Australian Group C touring car racing Falcons  the changes were mostly designed to enhance race durability these vehicles often referred to as PreCobras were intended to be raced by teams at Bathurst in 1977 The homologation modifications included rear wheel wells that were deepened inboard by 1 inch to accommodate larger racing wheels and tyres a reverse bonnet scoop to allow the race car engines to draw cool air from the base of the windscreen twin electric fans that were switchable from the dash replacing the single enginedriven fan a front shocker tower brace K brace that stiffened the front end an idler arm brace and an aero package including a rear blade spoiler similar to that used on the 2door Holden Torana A9X and a front air dam The 13 cars were available in standard body and interior colours and retained the side trim strips dummy rear brake scoops and unpainted chrome bumpers of the standard GS hardtops The race cars did complete the 1977 Endurance Series in their new specification and then participated in the 1978 ATCC season

The modifications that featured in these 13 GS Hardtops formed the basis of the specification for the 30 specific Option 97 Cobra Hardtops built in 1978 although there were minor differences as the Option 97 cars also incorporated further evolution parts such as reinforced fan brackets and a deeper front spoiler In addition the Option 97 cars received a black corduroy seat material and Scheel front seats to differentiate them from the Option 96 Cobras 

When final production of the XC Hardtop at the Broadmeadows Assembly plant was ending in March 1978 more than 400 body shells were left unsold and Ford Australia faced a dilemma of how to shift them rather than scrap them When an original proposal to turn these cars into black and gold Playboythemed cars complete with bunny decals was rejected as sending the wrong image for a family car company Ford turned to Edsel Ford II then the Deputy Managing Director of Ford Motor Company who was also MD of Ford Australia at that time from 1978 to 1980 He and a local design team elected to capitalise on Allan Moffat and Colin Bonds crushing 12 finish at the 1977 Bathurst 1000 by creating a road car with a Shelby Mustang look that could be homologated for racing while at the same time offering enthusiasts the opportunity to own a streetlegal version of Moffats race car The first prototype Falcon Cobra was built in late April 1978 and production began that same July

The cars were painted Bold Blue with an overlay of Sno White with Olympic Blue accent stripes separating the two colours  Cobra emblem decals a throwback to Carroll Shelbys Mustangs of the 1960s were affixed to the front fenders along with a name decal at the rear Unusually the bodyshells were painted blue first the intended area of blue stripes and sills then masked and the white coat painted over the top Each of the cars was given its own individual serial number and fitted with a sequentially numbered plaque from 001 to 400 on the dash The first 200 Cobras produced were given the 58L 351 Cleveland V8 while the other 200 received the 49L 302 Cleveland  the only exceptions to this being build number 001 is a 302ci 49 litre V8 and build number 351 is a 351ci 58 litre V8

Cobras were available with either automatic or manual transmission Standard equipment included fourwheel disc brakes limited slip differential 15inch Bathurst Globe wheels front  rear spoilers and dual exhaust The interiors were uniformly black with Cobra specific cloth seat inserts in black with blue stripes that match those on the outside body Cars numbered from 002 to 0031 were known as Option 97 specification the socalled Bathurst Cobras fitted with parts to allow homologation for racing including twin radiator fans switchable from the dash a gearbox oil cooler suspension bracing and reworked rear wheel body housings They were most easily identified from the other 370 Option 96 Cobras via their large and functional rearopening bonnet bulge Allan Moffats Moffat Ford Dealers race cars of late 1978 shared the same body paint decoration as the road cars

Falcon Cobras have become increasingly revered by collectors across Australia and a mint example might be worth upwards of 100000  with Option 97 cars rarely offered up for sale likely to fetch a further premium

At the 2007 Bathurst 1000 Ford Performance Vehicles unveiled a new limited edition Cobra celebrating 30 years since Moffat and Bonds 12 finish Like the original the new FPV GT Cobra sedan has a certified build of just 400 units In addition a Cobra Ute was created of which just 100 were built Both cars are powered by the 54litre Boss 302 engine the name is derived from the 302kW 405hp power output

New Zealand twentycent coin
The New Zealand twentycent coin is the secondlowestdenomination coin of the New Zealand dollar The 20cent coin was introduced when the New Zealand dollar was introduced on 10 July 1967 replacing the New Zealand florin coin Its original reverse of a kiwi was changed in 1990 when the image was moved onto the onedollar coin In 2006 its size was reduced and its edge altered to a Spanish flower as part of a revision of New Zealands coins which also saw its alloy become nickelplated steel

On 10 July 1967 New Zealands former predecimal pound currency pegged to the British pound was changed to a decimal dollar at a rate of two dollars to a pound Therefore 20 cents was worth a tenth of a pound The 20cent coin replaced the florin coin which had been worth two shillings or a tenth of a pound 

Like the florin the new 20cent coin was made of cupronickel 2858mm in diameter 1131grams in weight and had 100 edge milling The 20cent coin retained the presence of a kiwi on the reverse of the florin albeit in a different design

The original obverses of 20cent coins depicted Arnold Machins portrait of Queen Elizabeth II In 1986 the portrait was changed to the one by Raphael Maklouf which had been introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in the previous year Mintings of this coin from 1990 are rare

In 1990 the new 1 and 2 coins were released to replace the 1 and 2 notes As the 1 depicted a kiwi also the 20cents reverse had to be redesigned The new reverse side featured the wellknown Mori carving depicting Pukaki a chief of the Ngti Whakaue iwi tribe of Te Arawa In 1999 the portrait of the Queen was changed to a version by Ian RankBroadley which had been introduced to the coins of the pound sterling in the previous year No 20cent coins were minted between 1991 and 2001

The existing 20cent coins remained in circulation and greatly outnumbered the new design until 2006

On 31 July 2006 the new 20cent coin was released alongside the new 10cent and 50cent coins as part of the Reserve Banks Change for the better silver coin replacement The new 20cent coin had the same reverse as the 1990 to 2006 minted coins and the same obverse as the 1999onward coins but the coins were reduced in size The new 20cent coins are made of steel covered in a layer of nickel copper then nickel again The new coins are 2175mm in diameter and 4grams in weight They have Spanish flower milling around the edge splitting it into seven sections For their introduction in 2006 116 million were minted with a total value of NZ232 million The only other year of issue was 2008 where 80 million coins and a total value of NZ16 million were issued

The old 20cent coins were demonetised on 1 November 2006

Coin collectors recognise two distinct varieties of the 2014 20cent coin These vary in terms of the detail on both the Maori design and Queens portrait but are most easily differentiated in terms of the date shown with Die I having a standard wide date setting and Die II a much narrower setting Both varieties are common in circulation

According to Reserve Bank of New Zealand Values are in New Zealand dollars No large 20cent coins were minted in 1968 1970 19912001 2003 Due to the large amount made for the introduction of the small 20cent none were minted in 2007 or from 2009 onwards

Ph Qu
Ph Qu is a small island located about 100km from Phan Thit city Vietnam Only the rocky northern half of the island is inhabited with a population of 20698 people

During the French Indochina era the official name of the island was PouloCcirdeMer

Ph Qu district comprises a total of ten islands with Ph Qu Island being the largest The island is 165km in area The district is 120km south east of Phan Thit 150km south of Cam Ranh 120km east of Vng Tu 333km northeast of Con Son and 540km west of the Spratly Islands The highest point on the island is Mount Cam Dat at 106 m The north of the island is rocky while the south consists mostly of sand

Ph Qu island has three districts

Ph Qu is calling for domestic and foreign investors to invest in the island Ideally to develop infrastructure especially airports and hotels to serve tourists

Transport routes connecting the mainland and Ph Qu island are limited During calm seas the journey by ferry can take up to six hours limiting tourism However in mid2010 the cooperative shipping company Fortune put into operation a midspeed ferry shortening travel time to Ph Qu island to approximately 253h

2017  the midspeed ferry was stopped in 2015 and after a year was replaced with a ferry that takes 4 hours running alongside the 6 hour ferry In 2018 the midspeed ferry was reinstated and now travel to the island takes 25 hours in favourable conditions

Trichocyst
A trichocyst is an organelle found in certain ciliates and dinoflagellates

A trichocyst can be found in tetrahymena and along cila pathways of several metabolic systems
It is also a structure in the cortex of certain ciliate and flagellate protozoans consisting of a cavity and long thin threads that can be ejected in response to certain stimuli Trichocysts may be widely distributed over an organism or restricted to certain areas eg tentacles papillae around the mouth There are several types Mucoid trichocysts are elongated inclusions that may be ejected as visible bodies after artificial stimulation Filamentous trichocysts in Paramecium and other ciliates are discharged as filaments composed of a crossstriated shaft and a tip Toxicysts in Dileptus and certain other carnivorous protozoans tend to be localized around the mouth When discharged a toxicyst expels a long nonstriated filament with a rodlike tip which paralyzes or kills other microorganisms this filament is used to capture food and presumably in defense

The functional significance of other trichocysts is uncertain although those of Paramecium apparently can be extruded for anchorage during feeding

Stylistically this found the band in a more true black metal sound with squashed production growled vocals raging tempos blast beats and symphonic arrangements Accusations of the band being a Cradle of Filth ripoff began to manifest as the bands name got bigger

The album was remastered and rereleased in 1998 by Blackend with two bonus tracks and a different cover art

A music video was made for the track An Ode for a Haunted Wood

Richards worked on the geological survey of Victoria in 190607 while still an undergraduate student He went to work for De Bavay and Company in Broken Hill and then took up a position as a scholar and demonstrator at the University of Melbourne In 1910 Richards took up a position teaching in the Chemistry Geology and Mining Department of the Central Technical College CTC in the Government House Domain of George Street Brisbane forerunner of Queensland Institute of Technology He successfully applied to be a lecturer at the newly formed University of Queensland in 1911 Both the CTC and University of Queensland geology classes would share some of the same buildings in George Street Brisbane until the University moved to the St Lucia campus in 1950

Richards was interested in the building stones of both Victoria and later his adopted home of Queensland He published two papers on the building stones of Brisbane especially Helidon sandstone and was an advisor on the plans for the building work of the University of Queensland in 1930 to 1931 and again in 1938 among other projects

Richards would be a dynamic force for the Geology Department the Faculty of Science and the University during its early years In 1919 Richards became the Universitys first geology professor He was Dean of the Faculty of Science President of the Board of Faculties President of the Staff Association on the University Senate Chairman of Public Exams Committee Music Advisory Board and many others In 1946 Richards was Professor of Geology Deputy Chancellor of the university Chairman of Trustees of the National Art Gallery President of the Art Galleries and Museums Association of Australia and New Zealand Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Committee and many others He led geology camps to Spicers Gap and the Great Barrier Reef His wife would be a chaperone for the female students on many camps and dances held at the fledgling University Dorothy Hill would become one of the students of the Geology Department in 1925 and found him to be a great mentor of the Science students He encouraged her to apply for a Foundation Travelling Scholarship to the University of Cambridge in 1929 which she won

Richards also began the purchase of research materials to build a library at the University

In 1922 he founded along with Queensland Governor Sir Matthew Nathan the Great Barrier Reef Committee This led to two deep boring projects through the Reef in 1927 and 1937 to prove one of Charles Darwins theories and to look for ways to exploit the economic potential of the Reef The Committees public relations ventures in order to bring in more money for their research programmes would also lead to a number of biological expeditions to the Reef including the year long Low Isles Great Barrier Reef Expedition of 1928 This expedition brought in many biologists and geographers from around the world and led to publication of research at the British Natural History Museum The Committees work would eventually lead to the establishment of the Heron Island Research Station Australias first coral reef marine biology research station

In 1929 Richards took leave from the University and was a member of the Royal Commission into Mining in Queensland This enabled him to travel to the International Geology Conference in South Africa as a representative of the Australian and Queensland governments Being equally interested in art as he was in geology Richards was a member of the Survey of Australian and New Zealand Museums and Art Galleries for the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 193233 and received a Carnegie Institute medal for his services to this survey in 1936 This enabled him to take an extended trip overseas to visit the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC and the Seismology Laboratory in Pasadena California Caltech This visit led to a Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research CSIR grant to obtain a second MilneShaw Seismograph for the University following the 1935 earthquake in Gayndah Queensland The University established their first Seismology station in 1937 thanks to the work of Richards and his colleague WH Bryan Richards would be appointed to the Board of Trustees of the Queensland Art Gallery in 1938 and become President of the same in 1945 until his death in 1947

Richards died in 1947 in Brisbane survived by his wife Grace and two children He was celebrated for his energy and industriousness popularity with students and ability to foster cooperation between the University and the Queensland government

Following his death the new Geology Department building which he had toiled over to establish at the new campus of St Lucia was named in his honour It fronts the Great Court WH Bryan would succeed him in the position of Professor The HC Richards Memorial Prize was established in geology in acknowledgement of his contribution to the University of Queensland It was an annual prize in art from 19541972 A basrelief was sculpted of him in the entrance stones of the Geology building and an ammonite fossil carved into the entrance to the building was similarly named for him

Fernando Tarrida del Mrmol
Fernando Tarrida del Mrmol August 2 1861  1915 was a mathematics professor born in Cuba and raised in Catalonia best known for proposing anarchism without adjectives the idea that anarchists should set aside their debates over the most preferable economic systems and acknowledge their commonality in ultimate aims

Fernando Tarrida del Mrmol was born in 1861 in Cuba His family emigrated to Spain during the 1868 Glorious Revolution and his father ran a shoe and boot manufacturing plant in the Catalonian town of Sitges Tarrida received a degree in mathematics from the Pau lyce in southern France His classmate and later French prime minister Louis Barthou converted him to republicanism Tarrida moved to the University of Barcelona for a degree in civil engineering and became a professor of mathematics at Barcelonas Polytechnic

Despite his familys wealth he identified more closely with Barcelonas working class and visited their clubs to discuss politics and quality of life The workers appreciated his charisma and sincerity By the mid 1880sTarridas twentieshe was a collectivist anarchist who identified with the federalism of PierreJoseph Proudhon and Francesc Pi i Margall Tarrida viewed anarchism beyond political philosophy as an allencompassing philosophy or the process by which humanity integrates and develops He often referred to anarchism in mathematical formula as both the language to clarify his thoughts and to scientifically prove the philosophys tenets Tarrida gave public lectures and wrote about anarchism for libertarian journals and developed a friendship with the Spanish anarchist Anselmo Lorenzo Barcelona workers chose Tarrida as their delegate to the International Socialist Congress in Paris 1889

Tarrida first proposed the idea of anarchism without adjectives during a public speech in November 1889 Anarchists often debated their ideal economic conditions and anarchism without adjectives appealed anarchists to abandon these divisions accommodate other factions follow the basic principles of anarchism and instead work together towards their unified cause He argued that anarchists share opposition to dogma and should therefore let each other freely choose their choice of economic system Put another way anarchism was the axiom and their economic model was secondary Tarrida gave this speech at the Bellas Artes palace as a representative of an affinity group in commemoration of the Chicago Haymarket affair two years prior Tarrida himself did not publicly engage in the factionism between collectivism and communism though his earlier works adopted a collectivist position In 1890 the French anarchocommunist journal Le Rvolt charged the Spanish anarchist movement as overly collectivist and prone to authoritarian organization The journal challenged Tarrida to defend his position and in an open letter he affirmed their differences in tactics but agreement in ultimate goal He defended the Spanish anarchist model of forming alliances between groups and criticized the French anarchists puritanical rigidity as ineffectual against the centralized bourgeoisie in the absence of coordinated action Tarrida also noted the difference between the development of Spanish and French anarchism While the French called the Spanish workers associations authoritarian Tarrida wrote that these organizations were responsible for building the anarchist tradition in Spain and contributed to their workers natural rejection of communist worker models

The San Joaquin and Sierra Nevada Railroad or Rail Road was originally built as a narrow gauge that ran from Bracks Landing 106 miles west of Woodbridge on the San Joaquin Delta on the Brack Tract on the east side of South Mokelumne River between Hog Slough and Terminous to Woodbridge and Lodi and then east to the Sierra Nevada foothill town of Valley Springs The railroad was incorporated on March 28 1882 and construction was completed on April 15 1885 The railroad was built as a common carrier with copper mining being its primary traffic The track was built using 3540lb steel rails

On March 15 1888 the San Joaquin  Sierra Nevada was consolidated into Southern Pacific Railroads SP subsidiary the Northern Railway Company In 1897 the Northern Railway abandoned the track between Woodbridge and Bracks Landing and converted the rest of the line to  The following year the Northern Railway was consolidated into the Southern Pacific

In 19251926 Southern Pacific extended the branch line 8 miles east into the Sierras to its ending point known as Kentucky House or Kentucky Home The last 4 miles of the branch at Kentucky House were sold to the Calaveras Cement Company on April 28 1929 The Calaveras Cement Company closed the plant at Kentucky House in 1984 Prior to 1984 the SP was operating three freight trains per week between Lodi and Kentucky House The branch was listed in Southern Pacific timetables as the Kentucky House Branch and interchanged at Lodi with the SP mainline that ran from Stockton  Sacramento After the cement plant closed the branch was used to store railroad freight cars Eventually the tracks were removed

Walter Lincoln Hawkins 19111992 was an AfricanAmerican chemist and engineer widely regarded as a pioneer of polymer chemistry For thirtyfour years he worked at Bell Laboratories where he was instrumental in designing a longlasting plastic to sheath telephone cables so assisting the introduction of telephone services to thousands of Americans Hawkins was the first AfricanAmerican to become a member of the National Academy of Engineering and in 1992 he was awarded the National Medal of Technology by the US president George H W Bush

Walter Hawkins was born on March 21 1911 in Washington DC His father was a lawyer for the US Census Bureau and his mother was a science teacher in the District of Columbia school system
When he was young Hawkins was fascinated with how things worked For example it was not unusual for him to take apart one toy and reassemble it to make another one He also made springdriven toy boats to sail in the reflecting pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial Hawkins and a fellow elevenyearold once tried to build a perpetual motion machine not realizing that it was an impossible task He built a working radio so he could listen to Washington Senators baseball games

While at Washingtons Dunbar High School Hawkins noticed that his physics teacher drove an expensive new car every year The teacher who had invented a selfstarter mechanism to replace automobile hand cranks received a new car each year as partial payment from the company which had bought the mechanism Hawkins was tremendously excited to discover that a person could make a living through mechanical tinkering

After graduating from high school he went to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy New York In 1932 he graduated with a chemical engineering degree Unable to find a job during the Great Depression he enrolled in graduate school at Howard University where in 1934 he earned a masters degree in chemistry Professor Howard Blatt Hawkins friend and mentor at Howard informed him of a special scholarship at McGill University in Montreal Canada Hawkins enrolled at McGill earned his Doctorate in Chemistry and left to continue his research at Columbia University when he received a fellowship from the National Research Council

In 1942 Hawkins became the first AfricanAmerican to join the technical staff of Bell Laboratories By controlling much of the Pacific theater in World War II the Japanese had cut off much of Americas rubber supply from Southeast Asia Hawkins contributed to the development of a rubber substitute made from petroleum stock

After the war Hawkins began work on an important project a new and improved insulation for telephone cables Underground and underwater cables which were laid over incredibly long distances were covered with fiber wrapped in heavy expensive lead sheathing Scientists had known that new lightweight plastics would be a good alternative but common plastics did not last long outdoors Hawkins and Vincent Lanza in 1956 invented a plastic coating that could withstand extreme fluctuations in temperature last up to seventy years and was less expensive than lead Telephone lines were subsequently installed in rural areas bringing affordable phone service to thousands of people

Hawkins who worked at Bell Labs for thirtyfour years became assistant director of their chemical research lab in 1974 His work with polymers primarily plastics focused on the development of new products and recycling The extremely durable nature of plastic becomes a huge problem when it must be discarded Hawkins became an expert not only in making plastics last longer but in recycling these seemingly indestructible products

Upon his retirement from Bell Labs in 1976 Hawkins began teaching and encouraging college students to study science and engineering In 1981 he became the first chairman of Project SEED Support of the Educationally  Economically Disadvantaged an American Chemical Society program designed to promote science careers for minority students He also helped to set up a program at Bell Labs and ATT to recruit AfricanAmerican scientists and engineers

On August 20 1992 Hawkins died in San Marcos California due to heart failure He was 81

Hawkins was frequently honored as a polymer chemistry pioneer The first AfricanAmerican to become a member of the National Academy of Engineering Hawkins also won the International Medal of the Society of Plastics In a 1992 White House ceremony he received the National Medal of Technology from President George H W Bush

Shaky Isles
The Shaky Isles or Shaky Islands is a nickname for New Zealand At one time this nickname was used in New Zealand itself though its usage there is now seen as dated it is still fairly widely used in Australia

The name derived from New Zealands frequent seismic activity The islands lie on the margin of two colliding tectonic plates the Pacific and IndoAustralian Plates Earthquakes are common particularly in the southwest of the South Island and in the central North Island and the North Islands scenery is marked by several active and dormant volcanic cones

The phrase is at worst only very mildly derogatory and is usually only used humorously with no pejorative connotations

The country records more than 14000 earthquakes a year  but only about 150 are usually felt Schoolchildren in the country regularly undertake earthquake drills

4 September 2010 This 71 magnitude earthquake struck what was then New Zealands second largest city Christchurch damaging many buildings but with no loss of life This was mainly due to New Zealands building standards the epicentre being approximately from the city and the quake hitting at 435am

22 February 2011 A 63 magnitude earthquake caused far more damage in Christchurch including 181 deaths This quake struck at about lunchtime and was centred closer at Lyttelton and shallower than the prior quake explaining the resultant destruction

21 July 2013 A 65 magnitude earthquake struct in the Cook Strait near the town of Seddon and caused moderate damage in New Zealands capital Wellington It was preceded by a strong M57 foreshock

16 August 2013 A 66 magnitude earthquake struck near Lake Grassmere in South Islands Marlborough Region It quake added substantial more damage to the town of Seddon after the 65 Seddon earthquake one month prior and both are considered to be an earthquake doublet

2 September 2016 A 71 magnitude earthquake struck near Te Araroa off East Cape North Island Damage was localised to towns nearer to the epicentre of the earthquake with 255 claims for damage compensation being lodged

14 November 2016 A 78 magnitude earthquake struck near Culverden and Kaikoura in the North Canterbury area of the South Island Two deaths have been reported Moderate to significant damage occurred along the East Coast of central New Zealand from Christchurch all the way through Wellington The seabed near Kaikoura was raised 25 meters in some places

The term Shaky Isles has been used multiple times in New Zealand popular culture as a reference to the country Among the earliest uses of the term was by the Maori Troubadours in 1960 with their song Shakin in the Shaky Isles This was followed up in later decades by Mike Harding in 1989 and Dave Dobbyn in 1991 A New Zealand theatre company headed by Emma Deakin in London is called The Shaky Isles Theatre Company Shaky Isles is also the name of a cafe chain in Auckland

Bangsar Park
Bangsar Park was the first residential area to be developed within the area which is now known as Bangsar in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia It is a much soughtafter residential and commercial address in the Klang Valley
It lies about four kilometres southwest of the city centre and is a ten minutes drive by car from the city centre It is given the postcode of 59000

The Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur is the local governing authority It is represented by the Bangsar Park Residents Association Bangsar Park is also part of the Lembah Pantai constituency and its Member of Parliament is Nurul Izzah Anwar for the past 2 terms

Bangsar was initially a rubber estate One suggestion is that it derives its name from Bunge a Belgian and Grisar a Frenchman said to be the founders of a European company that ran the estate BungeGrisar The name of this estate was soon localised to Bungsar and finally Bangsar It was the nearest to Kuala Lumpur

It was later developed into a residential area Bangsar Park was the first area to be developed Apparently it was the first planned housing estates in Kuala Lumpur The first houses were built in 1969 Development in Bangsar started once Socfin estates sold the land to private developers

Though generally Bangsar is a hilly suburb Bangsar Park lies in the southern part of the area which of flat terrain

Jalan Maarof Maarof is Bangsars main thoroughfare It also divides Bangsar into two main parts On the east of this road lies Taman SA Bangsar Park Bukit Bangsar Bangsar Utama and onehalf of Bukit Bandaraya postcode 59000 The other neighbourhoods and other half of Bukit Bandaraya lie on the west postcode 59100

The Mobil service station along Jalan Maarof was sometimes used to identify the side of the road Bangsar Park is on considering most of Bangsar was on the other side This Mobil station was recently demolished
East of Bangsar Park lies Bukit Persekutuan a low density neighbourhood developed in the colonial days and Bukit Damansara Most of the vegetation from the forest has not been cleared thus it would appears as if the eastern neighbourhoods of Bangsar were actually surrounded by a jungle

A few monsoon drains were constructed when Bangsar was developed They have since been covered up although they remain operational

Bangsar Park is a popular residential area among both Malaysians and expatriates It is a melting pot today with a good balance of different races living here However it was never always that way The initial residents of Bangsar Park were mainly Ceylonese from Brickfields who were mostly government clerks and looking for a new clean neighbourhood to move into

Bangsar Park does not have any commercial area It is a purely residential area The closest thing to a commercial area is the row of shophouses housing sundry shops restaurants and a laundry shop

However residents of Bangsar Park do not find this a problem They love the peace and quiet and the homely feel of the area as a result of it being a purely residential area Besides the commercial areas of Bangsar Baru Lucky Gardens and Bangsar Utama are all within walking distance

Bangsar Park has also a large population of Gujaratis The Gujarati Association WP  Selangor building and Jain Mandir is also located at Lorong Maarof

Tanaka Chigaku
Tanaka Chigaku  18611939 was a Japanese Buddhist scholar and preacher of Nichiren Buddhism orator writer and ultranationalist propagandist in the Meiji Taish and early Shwa periods He is considered to be the father of Nichirenism the fiercely ultranationalistic blend of Nichiren Buddhism and Japanese Nationalism espoused by such figures as Nissho Inoue Kanji Ishiwara and Ikki Kita Notably however the childrens writer poet and rural activist Kenji Miyazawa also idolized Tanaka and both Miyazawa and Ishiwara joined his flagship organization the Kokuchkai in 1920

Born Tada Tomonosuke in Tokyo then called Edo the third son of a noted physician and former devotee of Pure Land Buddhism who had converted to Nichiren Buddhism Tanaka was placed under the care of the Rev Kawase Nichiren following the death of his parents in 1870 Enrolled as a novice at Kawases temple he later entered the Nichiren Buddhist academy of Daikyoin the predecessor to Rissho University during which time he adopted the sobriquet Chigaku meaning Wisdom and Learning

However during this time Tanaka came to be disillusioned with the sects leadership who he considered too passive in their teachings and in 1879 he abandoned the priesthood and set out to establish himself as a lay preacher of the true Nichiren Buddhism Briefly employed at a German engineering company in Yokohama he was quickly drawn to religious proselytizing joining the lay organization Nichirenkai  as a preacher in which capacity he honed his public speaking skills and developed his own distinct uncompromising Nichiren doctrine which he came to refer to as Nichirenism  Nichirenshugi

The 1890s saw Tanakas spiritual philosophy evolve in an increasingly nationalistic manner taking to concluding his works with the twin salutations of Namu Myh Renge Ky Homage to the Lotus Sutra and Imperial Japan for Ever and Ever  The decade saw him carry out extensive lecturing tours throughout Japan and establish his Nichiren study group Rissho Ankokukai  from his new base in Kamakura

A noted antiChristian and staunch opponent of Christian missionaries in Japan he applauded Japans triumph in the RussoJapanese War in 1905 stating that The war with Russia is divinely inspired to make Japanese citizens aware of their heavenly task In 1908 he moved his base to Miho Shizuoka Prefecture where he would write his most famous work The Doctrine of Saint Nichiren  in 1911 in which he casts the radical 13th century priest Nichiren as the champion of the Japanese nation and called for world unification through Nichirenism with the emperor as its core Japans very purpose of existence he writes is the implementation of this plan as a country conceived for building Nichiren Buddhism

in 1914 Tanaka amalgamated all of his followers into a single organization the  based in Miho He would maintain a busy lecture schedule until illness curtailed his activities in the late 1930s traveling not only throughout Japan but also embarking on speaking tours of Japaneseoccupied Korea and Manchukuo where he supported and gave lectures to Puyi who had been appointed Emperor of Manchukuo His nationalist and imperialist convictions only hardened with age believing that Japans 1931 takeover of Manchuria was divinely ordained and part of a divine plan to spread the true Nichiren Buddhism throughout Asia He even went as far as to compile diagrams of the states in which the Nichirenization of the world would take place By the 1950s he foresaw a total of 19900 students 19200 instructors and 23033250 followers spread across the AsiaPacific region reaching as far as New Zealand

While best known as a preacher and an orator Tanaka was also a skilled poet and dramatist with a keen interest in the traditional theatrical arts of Japan He wrote and performed numerous plays all with a heavily moralistic undertone and produced a volume of essays songs and poems

Tanaka died in 1939 at the age of 79 and is entombed in the Myoshu Mausoleum in Tokyo His son Dr Satomi Kishio took over the reins of his organization and remained a staunch defender of his father in the postwar era when numerous academics denounced him as a fascist for his ideologys links to such ultranationalist figures as Nissho and Kita

2005 Pennsylvania General Assembly pay raise controversy
In the early morning hours of July 7 2005 the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed pay increases for state lawmakers judges and top executivebranch officials The vote took place at 2am without public review or commentary and Governor Ed Rendell signed the bill into law The raise increased legislators base pay from 16 to 34 depending on position

The pay raise included a provision allowing legislators to take their raises immediately in the form of unvouchered expenses This provision was included due to the Pennsylvania Constitutions clause prohibiting legislators from taking salary increases in the same term as which they are passed State courts have ruled similar legislation to be constitutional on three separate occasions

Outrage over the pay raise was picked up by several influential state blogs like Grassrootspa and PennPatriot Blog Advocacy groups spawned several grassroots movements some geared toward voting out incumbents and some seeking support for a Constitutional Convention or a reduction in the size of the legislature  The legislature repealed the pay raise after four months by a 500 vote in the senate and 1971 vote in the house 

The first victim of the public uproar was Supreme Court Justice Russell M Nigro who became the first Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice to be denied retention Nigro asserted that he had not taken part in the pay raise However critics noted that Chief Justice Ralph Cappy helped draft the bill and that prior Court opinions upheld such practices

On November 16 2005 Governor Rendell signed a repeal of the pay raise after a near unanimous vote for repeal only House Minority Whip Mike Veon voted against the repeal

Despite the repeal a total of 17 legislators were defeated in the 2006 primary elections including Senate President Pro Tempore Robert Jubelirer and Senate Majority Leader David J Brightbill They were the first topranking Pennsylvania legislative leaders to lose a primary election since 1964

The November 2006 General Election claimed several more members who supported the pay raise including Republican representatives Gene McGill Matt Wright Tom Gannon and Matthew Good and Democrat Veon The defeats were widely attributed to anger over the pay raise 

Frank LaGrotta who was defeated in the 2006 primary election over the pay raise issue was one of many legislators who were paying back their unvouchered expenses in installments After pleading guilty to two counts of conflict of interest for hiring relatives as ghost employees he stopped repayment and was even refunded the amount that he had previously returned

In November 2009 Barbara McIlvaine Smith announced that she would not run for reelection in 2010 saying that she was frustrated with the progress of the postpay raise reform movement However she ultimately did run for reelection in 2010 and lost to Republican challenger Dan Truitt

Caid sport
Caid  are various ancient and traditional Irish football games Caid is now used by people in some parts of Ireland to refer to modern Gaelic football

The word caid originally referred to the ball which was used It was made out of animal skin with a natural bladder inside

Caid is believed to have influenced the modern sport of Gaelic football the rules of which were officially published in 1887 and is now organised and governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association GAA as an amateur sport 

There is some evidence that caid was taken around the world by the Irish diaspora and some historians argue that it may have also played some part in the origins of Australian rules football although such a relationship is controversial and the subject of debate 

The first recorded mention of football in Ireland was in 1308 when John McCrocan a spectator at a football game at Newcastle County Down was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard Football games are mentioned in the Statute of Galway 1527 which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned hokie  the hurling of a little ball with sticks or staves as well as other sports The Sunday Observance Act of 1695 imposed a fine of one shilling for anyone found playing Despite this the earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between Louth and Meath at Slane in 1712

Caid was especially popular in rural areas such as the Dingle Peninsula of Kerry and Eigeen in west Cork One observer in the mid19th century Father W Ferris described two main forms of caid during this period the field game in which the object was to put the ball through archlike goals formed from the boughs of two trees and the epic crosscountry game which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary Both of these were rough and tumble contact sports in which wrestling pushing and the holding of opposing players was allowed It was usually played by teams of unlimited numbers representing communities until a clear result was achieved or the players became too exhausted to continue 

These games appear to have been similar to the traditional Welsh game of cnapan which was played by teams of up to 1000 men from adjacent parishes Cnapan however was played with a hard ball and thus involved no kicking it was strictly a game in which the ball was passed or smuggled from one player to another with the object of getting it to the opposing teams parish church porch or to some other agreed destination An inter parish mob football game similar to cnapan called Hyrlan In English Hurling is still played in Cornwall on dates that coincide with religious festivals such as Shrove Tuesday

By the late 19th century caid was in steep decline and was threatened with extinction spurring the formation of the GAA which published official rules for the game in 1887 also adopting aspects of the earlier codified sport  hurling

Wilfred Eade Agar
Wilfred Eade Agar FRS 27 April 1882  14 July 1951 was an AngloAustralian zoologist

Agar was born in Wimbledon England He was educated at Sedbergh School Yorkshire and at Kings College Cambridge where he read zoology He served at Gallipoli in World War I His father was a solicitor and businessman and he was the first to find a hockey game in its modern form 

In 1908 Agar had married Elizabeth MacDonald in Glasgow Together with his family Agar lived on the university campus until his retirement in 1948 then they moved to Kew Being retired he continued to do researches and write but was extremely worried about his poor health He had suffered from a coronary thrombosis in 1947 and on 14 July 1951 he died at Kew survived by his wife two sons and three daughters he was cremated

In 1904 Agar was declared as a demonstrator in zoology at University of Glasgow where he put down roots in teaching and research His work on the embryology of the lungfish Lepidosiren and Protopterus caused a fellowship at Kings College Cambridge this did not make an impact on his leaving Glasgow for he had to continue academic and research work

The work on Lepidosiren was very precious for him The cells of this fish being unusually large offer favourable material for the study of chromosomes and in 1907 aided by grants from the Royal Society and the Balfour Fund at Cambridge Agar made an expedition to the almost unreachable Gran Chaco Paraguay to collect material for cytological study His intensive study of spermatogenesis in Lepidosiren represented critical confirmation that the chromosome mechanism could provide a physical basis for Mendels laws Another meaningful contribution to Mendelian theory arrived at his work on inheritance in parthenogenetic crustacea He found out that apart from rare mutations the genetic constitution of these crustacea remained unchanged generation after generation This work provided the first direct evidence from animals that the segregation of genes is according to the segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis

In 1919 he accepted the chair of zoology at the University of Melbourne his notable projects concerned marsupial chromosomes and inheritance in cattle Doing it he was afraid of giving up most of his ambitions his anxiety seemed justified when he realized that he was to give all the lectures and conduct a big amount of the laboratory classes without help He successfully challenged the Lamarckian findings of William McDougall relating to the inheritance of the effects of training in rats Agar offered the newer disciplines of cytology and genetics and these remained his principal teaching interest However his courses were the first of such kind in Australian universities He established the studies on marsupial chromosomes and his paper on inheritance in cattle is considered to be the earliest in Australia to introduce genetical techniques to animalbreeding

From student days Agar had taken an interest in the problem of Lamarckian inheritance Like a majority of biologists he turned down the theory that acquired characters are inherited but it kept on receiving support The most crucial of Agars contributions to this dispute was his repetition of an experiment which the psychologist William McDougall proclaimed had demonstrated the inheritance of the effects of training in rats It was the most significant evidence published in support of the Lamarckian theory and not many criticisms treated it seriously weakened McDougalls claim However the results of Agars properly checked the experiment continued over twenty years completely rejected the Lamarckian interpretation of McDougalls experiment

He was elected to the Royal Society in 1921 

In 1938 Agar was elected president of the Eugenics Society of Victoria He said it was a disastrous state of affairs that size of families was usually in inverse ratio to intelligence
Although Agar was retired he devoted himself to administrative work at the university He was a councilmember during a great deal of years twice dean of the faculty of science and chairman of the professorial board in 193134 regulating the cogitations that happened before the appointment of a fulltime vicechancellor His services to science and to the university were recognized by an OBE in 1939 and a CBE in 1948

In his early years in Melbourne Agar got interested in animal psychology and implemented experiments on the capacity to learn by experience of a range of animals from amoeba to crayfish and snails These studies during a long period were a source of great enjoyment for him They gave few publications but created in return for a background for his increasing preoccupation with wide biological concepts and the philosophy of science which was represented in A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism Melbourne 1943 second edition 1951 Agar devoted this book to undoubtedly his most important contribution to biological theory The book was based on the system of Whiteheads philosophy of the organism and argued for a form panpsychism

Agar was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1944 and elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society
Agars scientific achievements were greatly recognized His scholarship and balanced judgment gained him the respect and faith of his colleaguesstudents and acquaintances His distinctive traits of character were kindness determination and courtesy Except of his scientific interests he was deeply interested in philosophy enjoyed poetry and drama and sometimes drew some watercolour sketching

Agar Street in the Canberra suburb of Bruce was dedicated in his name

A Year at the Movies One Mans Filmgoing Odyssey
A Year at the Movies One Mans Filmgoing Odyssey is a book written by Mystery Science Theater 3000 performer Kevin Murphy about his experiences of seeing a movie each day for the entire year of 2001 Much of the content derives not only from Murphys filmgoing odyssey but also from his thoughts and observations on the changing nature of the filmgoing experience itself Murphy comments extensively on the overwhelming prevalence of multiplex movie theaters which generally screen Hollywood blockbuster films at the expense of a wider range of classic independent and foreign language films While many of the daily film viewings chronicled in the book fall into the Hollywood kitsch category quite a few sections deal with films that Murphy actually enjoyed watching whether because of the film itself or because of the quality of the theater in which it was viewed

Karaikal district
Karaikal district also Karikal or Karaikkal is one of the four districts of the Union Territory of Puducherry in India

Karaikal city about 16km north of Nagappattinam and 12km south of Tarangambadi is the regional headquarters Karaikal region is made up of the Communes of Karaikal Kottucherry Nedungadu Tirunallar Neravy and Tirumalarajanpattinam

Several explanations are offered for the word Karaikal The Imperial Gazetteer gives it the meaning fish pass According to Julien Vinson the town is said to have known as Karaigiri in Sanskrit However the name Karaikal is no doubt a combination of two words Karai and Kal Both the words Karai and Kal have several meanings of which the more acceptable ones are lime mix and canal respectively Hence it has been suggested that the name may mean a canal built of lime mix


This Karaikal area formed an integral part of the Pallava kingdom in the eighth centuryC 731796 Poet Sekkizhar 9921042 describes the town as vanga malik kadar karaikal the Karaikal of many vessels on the coast in his Peria puranam In that the poet relates the life story of one Punithavathiar who abandoned the pleasures of material life and devoted herself entirely to a life of prayer and penance to signify her devotion to Lord Siva He called her Karaikal Ammayar conveniently after the town which must have been famous already


In 1738 Dumas a shrewd calculative prudent man and a lover of peace and above all one who was anxious to extend the French territory in India by smooth means negotiated with Sahuji of Thanjavur for possession of Karaikal the fortress of Karakalcheri and 5 village for 40000 chakras On 1421739 the French took possession of Karaikal town the fort of Karakalcheri and 8 dependent villages The King of Thanjavur raised the price for the town of Karaikal and the fort of Karakalcheri to 50000 chakras

He also demanded a loan of 150000 chakras without interest repayable in 3 years against the hypothecation of Mayavaram lands and an annual rent of 4000 pagodas for 5 villages 8The French agreed to all the terms except for the payment of 150000 chakras which was reduced to 10000 chakras while the annual rental was reduce to two or three thousand chakras The villages so received were Kilaiyur Melaiyur Puduthurai Kovilpathu and Tirumalairayanpattinam Subsequently 2 villages were ceded to the French Pratap Singh who succeeded the throne renewed demand for a loan of 100000 chakra and on receipt of the first instalment of 4000 chakras he assigned 8 more villages to the French viz Codague Kondagai Vanjiyur Arimullimangalam Niravi Dharmapuram Uzhiapathu Mattakudi probably Mathalangudi and Polagam Then on 1221740 he sold for 60000 chakras these villages which he had assigned only the previous year for 40000 chakras

The same year he pledged Thirunallar Mahanam for 55350 chakras and also pledged 33 villages for 60000 chakras By a treaty signed on 1211750 Pratap Singh ceded to the French 81 villages around Karaikal and cancelled the annual rent of 2000 pagodas payable for the villages This was all the territory the French possessed around Thanjavur when they surrendered to the British in 1761 The territory then passed twice to the British control before it was finally handed over to the French in 18161817 under the Treaty of Paris 1814

The formation of Karaikal national congress on 1361947 and Students Congress on 3111947 symbolised the first concrete expression of popular desire in Karaikal for freedom from French rule The French ruled this district till 31 October 1954 on which date the French flag flying atop the government house at Karaikal was lowered with due military honors before a large gathering of officials and nonofficials Thus the de facto transfer of power took place on 1 November 1954 followed by de jure transfer on 16 August 1962

Hack falconry
Hacking is a training method that helps young falcons reach their hunting potential by giving them exercise and experience This technique is used to prepare the falcon to become an independent hunter The sequence of the procedure includes captivity releasing flight and either the falcon will be recaptured for falconry or released into the wild This has also been adapted to other raptor species to preserve the population Generally falconers agree that hacked falcons are better and more preferred in the field Hacking is beneficial not only for the falconers but for the bird itself and the species however there are some criticism and restrictions that come along with this method

Hacking sites are usually large tracts of land These areas have to be similar to the natural surroundings of a wild nest The young raptors are put in a hack box boxes that contain a nest inside that protect them from predators and are usually placed on a high site eg cliffs atop poles Eggs are either captive bred or taken from wild nests and the chicks are placed in the boxes a couple of weeks before they reach their fledge age of six weeks Until then the birds are closely looked after and provided food without too much human contact

The box is open after they have been in there for about 5 to 10 days which gives them the freedom to do what they want around the box However they are not ready to fly yet At this point they can climb down from their box flap their wings to get a feel for the wind and exercise their muscles Just as they would in the wild the young stay close to the safe area

The time until the first flight is taken should take about 3 days after the hack box is open which should be a distance around a few dozen feet Afterwards the young start to fly further away for a longer span Hacking has an indefinite time period because it depends on the weather conditions and the personality of the bird At this flying stage the raptors learn how to selfhunt but are still fed and watched over Males are more likely to hunt independently before females do

Once the falcons are confident and independent they are either allowed to migrate into the wild recaptured for falconry and trained further ie with a lure for sport or released into the wild If the purpose of the hack is to prepare the raptor to be in the wild then the reserve hopes that the falcons will come back in a few years to nest there



Falconry has been a hunting sport since 2000 BC originating in ancient China and Egypt and since then the technique of hacking has been used and evolved The term hacking however was not coined until the Elizabethan era During that period falconers brought a hack an old English word for a type of wagon to a hilltop and placed young falcons upon it when they still did not know how to fly yet

There were over threehundred breeding pairs of peregrine falcons before World War II in eastern United States In the late 1940s a large abrupt decline of prey birds came about On top of the preWWII causes of gradual decrease of population eg shooting of birds egg collecting predators etc the main component to the downfall was the popular use of an insecticide called DDT The product would be carried in the prey and kill the birds off and DDE the byproduct would accumulate in a females body causing the eggs produced by her to become fragile Because of this disruption Peregrine falcons were officially on the federal endangered species list in 1970 Four years later a program to restore the birds population started in which they were bred in captivity Breeders adapted the hacking technique so that the falcons and other endangered raptors could become independent once released into the wild Additional hacking could even be conducted in urban areas when old nests or eyries were found atop buildings

Currently there are programs and organizations that continue to successfully release falcons into the wild

Inglenook Community High School
Inglenook Community High School is a Toronto public high school which offers grade 10 11 and 12 level courses It is housed in an historical building designed by William George Storm in Corktown in downtown Toronto Ontario The school has on average one hundred students and six teachers It is located in the oldest continuallyoperated school building of the Toronto District School Board

In 1994 Inglenook Community High School was named an exemplary school by the Canadian Education Association The school features a familylike atmosphere and a focus on the community teachers students and parents are all involved in school decisions

In 1985 archaeologists digging on the school grounds uncovered fascinating clues regarding Torontos history as a terminus of the Underground Railroad Between 1834 and 1890 this site was the home of Lucie and Thornton Blackburn refugee former slaves from Kentucky who started Torontos first taxicab company

Twin plaques have been erected at this site and one in Louisville KY

Inglenook is located in the oldest continuallyoperated school building in the Toronto District School Board Originally Sackville Street School it was designed by William G Storm The first principal of Sackville Street School which replaced Palace Street School at the corner of Front and Cherry Streets was Georgina Stanley Riches who served from 1887 to 1912 At one time the school enrolled 269 students In 1974 Sackville Street School closed and the building became home to both Inglenook Community High School and an aboriginal learning centre which soon moved out The school is said to be haunted

Inglenook prides itself on creating an environment ready to adapt to the specific needs of individual students enrolled each year

Inglenook gives more power to the student body than the average Toronto school The Committee on Evaluations Academic Standards and Admissions CEASA is the schools disciplinary body If corrective measures are required two students and teachers meet with the pupils involved and attempt to rectify the situation There are no detentions and no letters home Students are responsible for attendance and schoolwork which are mandatory

Inglenook offers a program called Outreach which is completed on Wednesdays in lieu of traditional courses The other four schooldays each have a double period to make up for Wednesdays lost time In Outreach the student is expected to volunteer in the community for three hours a week They then relate this experience to one of their academic courses by doing a tiein project which receives a mark included in the final course grade

After the first semester students can also perform an equivalent of Outreach known as Inreach This is still affiliated with a specific course and a tiein project is still completed but instead of performing volunteer work the student can pursue an interest such as learning to paint acquiring a new language or writing a play

Inglenook features an openaccess kitchen which is cleaned along with dishes from the classrooms and student lounge by two hoppers after classes each day Hoppers are two students who are chosen for duty on any particular day and as it is rotational each student will only have to clean once per semester

The school features a public art space named the Inglenook Gallery There is also a student lounge with ample furniture and books and most of the classrooms contain couches

Die integrated circuit
A die in the context of integrated circuits is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated Typically integrated circuits are produced in large batches on a single wafer of electronicgrade silicon EGS or other semiconductor such as GaAs through processes such as photolithography The wafer is cut diced into many pieces each containing one copy of the circuit Each of these pieces is called a die

There are three commonly used plural forms dice dies and die To simplify handling and integration onto a printed circuit board most dice are packaged in various forms

Most dies are composed of silicon and used for integrated circuits The process begins with the production of monocrystalline silicon ingots These ingots are then sliced into disks with a diameter of up to 300mm These wafers are then polished to a mirror finish before going through photolithography In many steps the transistors are manufactured and connected with metal interconnect layers These prepared wafers then go through wafer testing to test their functionality The wafers are then sliced and sorted to filter out the faulty dies Functional dies are then packaged and the completed integrated circuit is ready to be shipped

A die can host many types of circuits One common use case of an integrated circuit die is in the form of a Central Processing Unit CPU Through advances in modern technology the size of the transistor within the die has shrunk exponentially following Moores Law Other uses for dies can range from LED lighting to power semiconductor devices

Cyclic ADP Ribose frequently abbreviated as cADPR is a cyclic adenine nucleotide like cAMP with two phosphate groups present on 5 OH of the adenosine like ADP further connected to another ribose at the 5 position which in turn closes the cycle by glycosidic bonding to the nitrogen 1 N of the same adenine base whose position N has the glycosidic bond to the other ribose The Nglycosidic bond to adenine is what distinguishes cADPR from ADPribose ADPR the noncyclic analog cADPR is produced from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD by ADPribosyl cyclases  as part of a second messenger system

cADPR is a cellular messenger for calcium signaling It stimulates calciuminduced calcium release at lower cytosolic concentrations of Ca Primary target of cADPR is the ER Ca2 uptake mechanism Potentiation of Ca2 release by cADPR is mediated by increased accumulation of Ca2 in the SR

cADPR and ADPR are synthesized from NAD by the bifunctional ectoenzymes of the CD38 family also includes the GPIanchored CD157 and the specific monofunctional ADP ribosyl cyclase of the mollusc Aplysia The same enzymes are also capable of hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR Catalysis proceeds via a covalently bound intermediate The hydrolysis reaction is inhibited by ATP and cADPR may accumulate Synthesis and degradation of cADPR by enzymes of the CD38 family involve respectively the formation and the hydrolysis of the Nglycosidic bond In 2009 the first enzyme able to hydrolyze the phosphoanhydride linkage of cADPR ie the one between the two phosphate groups has been reported

Mill Bluff State Park
Mill Bluff State Park is a state park in westcentral Wisconsin United States It is located in eastern Monroe and western Juneau counties near the village of Camp Douglas A unit of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve the park protects several prominent sandstone bluffs to high that formed as sea stacks 12000 years ago in Glacial Lake Wisconsin As a result these bluffs are steep and angular dissimilar to the rounded terrain more typical of the eastern half of the United States The bluffs served as landmarks to both early pioneers and travelers today on Interstate 9094 which passes through the park

There are ten named bluffs in the park Mill Bluff high is between the interstate and US Route 12 The park office is at its foot and the campground is just to the west Bee Bluff although smaller and only high is the most visible bluff from the interstate as it stands adjacent to the westbound lanes To the north is Camels Bluff two separate outcroppings that together resemble the humps of a camel Nearby are Devils Monument and a high pinnacle called Cleopatras Needle The other less accessible bluffs are Round Bluff and Sugar Bowl Bluff to the south Wildcat Bluff and Bear Bluff to the north and Long Bluff to the northeast Also in the northeast is Ragged Rock an tall former bluff whose protective cap was worn away and is eroding into a conical mound

The bluffs in the park and others nearby are formed of Late Cambrian sandstone Stratigraphically the stone of the bluffs is part of the Galesville Member of the Dresbach Group Sandstone from the Ironton Member of the Franconia Formation which is more solidly concreted tops each bluff This capping layer helped protect the softer stone below it from erosion Similar structures elsewhere in Wisconsin would have been bulldozed away by glaciers but these bluffs lie in the Driftless Area that part of the American Midwest which was never glaciated The bluffs are all outliers of the Franconia Cuesta to the south

During the last ice age a tongue of ice dammed the Wisconsin River causing the water to back up into Glacial Lake Wisconsin It is estimated that the lake was about deep in this area so the taller bluffs became islands while the shorter ones would have been entirely underwater For the 3000 years of the lakes existence waves eroded the edges of the bluffs giving them their distinctive steep sides Thus in a geological sense the bluffs are sea stacks because they formed in a body of water In practice the larger formations are described as mesas the mediumsized ones as buttes and the smallest as a pinnacle

The flat ground in the park consists of finely sorted sediments that settled to the bottom of Glacial Lake Wisconsin Glacial erratics have been found on the former lakebed which are explained as rocks which were embedded in icebergs that melted as they were floating in the lake

The park is mostly forested with northern pin oak jack pine red pine eastern white pine and white oak dominant 

Several of the bluffs bear 400yearold petroglyphs shaped like bird tracks contemporaneous with the RocheaCri Petroglyphs in RocheaCri State Park 

The diaries and journals of westbound settlers often mention these bluffs A sawmill was operated in the vicinity after which Mill Bluff was named

Mill Bluff and a small area at its foot was proclaimed a state park on August 13 1936 Mill Bluff State Park was added to the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve in May 1971 The parks boundaries were expanded to include the other bluffs later In 2002 a portion of the park containing all of the major bluffs received a further level of protection as Mill Bluff State Natural Area

Mill Bluff State Park is open from May to September Small game hunting is permitted in sections of the park from November 1 to December 15 and deer hunting during a shorter period

The parks small campground has 21 sites 6 with electrical hookups Amenities are primitive with pit toilets and no showers Potable water is available from hand pumps

Swimming is available in a springfed lake south of the campground Sand has been added to make a beach

A nature trail circles the base of Mill Bluff 223 stone steps built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s lead to its top north on County Road W Funnel Road is a pullout for the Camels Bluff loop trail which passes between the two sections of Camels Bluff and leads past the base of Devils Monument and Cleopatras Needle

Because the bluffs are formed of soft sandstone and geologically unique all climbing is prohibited

Seismic source
A seismic source is a device that generates controlled seismic energy used to perform both reflection and refraction seismic surveys A seismic source can be simple such as dynamite or it can use more sophisticated technology such as a specialized air gun Seismic sources can provide single pulses or continuous sweeps of energy generating seismic waves which travel through a medium such as water or layers of rocks Some of the waves then reflect and refract and are recorded by receivers such as geophones or hydrophones

Seismic sources may be used to investigate shallow subsoil structure for engineering site characterization or to study deeper structures either in the search for petroleum and mineral deposits or to map subsurface faults or for other scientific investigations The returning signals from the sources are detected by seismic sensors geophones or hydrophones in known locations relative to the position of the source The recorded signals are then subjected to specialist processing and interpretation to yield comprehensible information about the subsurface

A seismic source signal has the following characteristics
The generalized equation that shows all above properties is
where formula2 is the maximum frequency component of the generated waveform

The most basic seismic source is a sledge hammer either striking the ground directly or more commonly striking a metal plate on the ground known as hammer and plate Useful for seismic refraction surveys down to about 20 m below surface

Explosives most widely used as seismic sources are knows as gelatin dynamites These dynamites are placed into three subcategories straight gelatins in which nitroglycerin also known as glyceryl trinitrate with the chemical formula C3H5ONO23 is the active component ammonia gelatins in which ammonia nitrite with chemical formula NHNO as the active component and semi gelatins in which the composition consists mostly of nitroglycerin

Upon detonation explosives release large volumes of expanding gas very quickly forcing great pressure to the surroundings in the form of seismic waves 

Using explosives as seismic sources has been in practice for decades because of the reliability and energy efficiency they provide Such sources are most commonly used on land and swampy environments because of high thickness in sedimentsTypical charge sizes used in the field for reflection surveys are 025kg to 100kg for single hole sources 025kg to 250kg or more for multiple hole sources and may reach 2500kg or more for refraction surveys

Though dynamites and other explosives are efficient seismic sources because of their reduced costs ease of transport in difficult terrains and lack of regular maintenance compared to other sourcesthe use of explosives is becoming restricted in certain areas causing decline and increasing popularity for alternative seismic sources

For instance hexanitrostilbene was the main explosive fill in the thumper mortar round canisters used as part of the Apollo Lunar Active Seismic Experiments Generally the explosive charges are placed between below ground in a hole that is drilled with dedicated drilling equipment for this purpose This type of seismic drilling is often referred to as Shot Hole Drilling A common drill rig used for Shot Hole Drilling is the ARDCO C1000 drill mounted on an ARDCO K 4X4 buggy These drill rigs often use water or air to assist the drilling

An air gun is used for marine reflection and refraction surveys It consists of one or more pneumatic chambers that are pressurized with compressed air at pressures from 14 to 21 MPa 2000 to 3000 lbfin Air guns are submerged below the water surface and towed behind a ship When an air gun is fired a solenoid is triggered which releases air into a fire chamber which in turn causes a piston to move thereby allowing the air to escape the main chamber and producing a pulse of acoustic energy Air gun arrays may consist of up to 48 individual air guns with different size chambers fired in concert the aim being to create the optimum initial shock wave followed by the minimum reverberation of the air bubbles

Air guns are made from the highest grades of corrosion resistant stainless steel Large chambers ie greater than 1L or 70cuin tend to give low frequency signals and the small chambers less than 1 L give higher frequency signals

A plasma sound source PSS otherwise called a spark gap sound source or simply a sparker is a means of making a very low frequency sonar pulse underwater For each firing electric charge is stored in a large highvoltage bank of capacitors and then released in an arc across electrodes in the water The underwater spark discharge produces a highpressure plasma and vapor bubble which expands and collapses making a loud sound Most of the sound produced is between 20 and 200Hz useful for both seismic and sonar applications

There are also plans to use PSS as a nonlethal weapon against submerged divers

In 1953 the weight dropping thumper technique was introduced as an alternative to dynamite sources
A thumper truck or weightdrop truck is a vehiclemounted ground impact system which can be used to provide a seismic source A heavy weight is raised by a hoist at the back of the truck and dropped generally about three meters to impact or thump the ground To augment the signal the weight may be dropped more than once at the same spot the signal may also be increased by thumping at several nearby places in an array whose dimensions may be chosen to enhance the seismic signal by spatial filtering

More advanced thumpers use a technology called Accelerated Weight Drop AWD where a high pressure gas min 7 MPa 1000 lbfin is used to accelerate a heavy weight hammer  to hit a base plate coupled to the ground from a distance of  Several thumps are stacked to enhance signal to noise ratio AWD allows both more energy and more control of the source than gravitational weightdrop providing better depth penetration control of signal frequency content

Thumping may be less damaging to the environment than firing explosives in shotholes though a heavily thumped seismic line with transverse ridges every few meters might create longlasting disturbance of the soil An advantage of the thumper later shared with Vibroseis especially in politically unstable areas is that no explosives are required

EMP sources based on the electrodynamic and electromagnetic principles

A Seismic vibrator propagates energy signals into the Earth over an extended period of time as opposed to the near instantaneous energy provided by impulsive sources The data recorded in this way must be correlated to convert the extended source signal into an impulse The source signal using this method was originally generated by a servocontrolled hydraulic vibrator or shaker unit mounted on a mobile base unit but electromechanical versions have also been developed

The Vibroseis exploration technique was developed by the Continental Oil Company Conoco during the 1950s and was a trademark until the companys patent lapsed

Boomer sound sources are used for shallow water seismic surveys mostly for engineering survey applications Boomers are towed in a floating sled behind a survey vessel Similar to the plasma source a boomer source stores energy in capacitors but it discharges through a flat spiral coil instead of generating a spark A copper plate adjacent to the coil flexes away from the coil as the capacitors are discharged This flexing is transmitted into the water as the seismic pulse

Originally the storage capacitors were placed in a steel container the bang box on the survey vessel The high voltages used typically 3000 V required heavy cables and strong safety containers Recently low voltage boomers have become available These use capacitors on the towed sled allowing efficient energy recovery lower voltage power supplies and lighter cables The low voltage systems are generally easier to deploy and have fewer safety concerns

Correlationbased processing techniques also enable seismologists to image the interior of the Earth at multiple scales using natural eg the oceanic microseism or artificial eg urban background noise as a seismic source For example under ideal conditions of uniform seismic illumination the correlation of the noise signals between two seismographs provides an estimate of the bidirectional seismic impulse response

VX videocassette format
VX was a shortlived and unsuccessful consumer analog recording videocassette format developed by Matsushita and launched in 1975 in Japan In the United States it was sold using the Quasar brand and marketed under the name The Great Time Machine to exhibit its timeshifting capabilities since VX machines had a companion electromechanical clock timer for timed recording of television programs In Japan the VX100 model was launched in 1975 with the VX2000 following in 1976 The first and only model sold in North America was the Quasar VR1000 based on the Panasonic VX2000 with the VT100 timer

The VX cassette itself had both reels of magnetic tape stacked on top of each other in a coaxial fashion much like the earlier Philips VCR and Cartrivision formats in the bottom half of the tape with a circular opening on the underside of the top half of the cassette where the video head drum would enter The tape in this opening was preformed in a loop to go around the head drum eliminating the need for the tape to be pulled out of the cassette and threaded around the drum as with later videocassette formats such as VHS and Betamax The opening was protected by a cylindrical plastic plug to protect the tape which was unscrewed from the opening when the tape was loaded in the machine by means of moving a horizontal lever on the front of the machine and inserted back into the tape when ejected by moving the lever back

The video head drum itself of a VX machine also has the unique distinction of being completely removable and replaceable without any special tools or equipment The drum has a knurled nut on top which can be adjusted by hand allowing the drum to be removed from the deck for cleaning or replacement To this date the VX machines have been the only VCR designed with this feature

Hand fetishism
Hand fetishism or hand partialism or also Quirofilia is the sexual fetish for hands This may include the sexual attraction to a specific area such as the fingers palm or nails or the attraction to a specific action performed by the hands which may otherwise be considered nonsexualsuch as washing or drying dishes This fetish may manifest itself as a desire to experience physical interaction or as a source of sexual fantasy

Hand fetishism is recognized by the porn industry however aside from handjobs it is one of the least common fetishes despite foot fetishism being the most common

Hand fetishism is usually based in the biological indication that a partner is healthy and a good potential mate

A hand fetish is a sexual attraction to the hands This attraction is most commonly expressed with fingering handjobs sucking on the fingers and licking the palms

Fingernail fetishism a subtype of hand fetishism is often expressed with scratching with the fingernails and painting the fingernails

In 2007 a study was conducted by the University of Bologna on around 5000 fetishist participants to see the prevalence of fetishes The study analyzed the content inside online fetish communities and found only 669 participants referring to nails an extension of hand fetishism This did not refer to fingernails specifically and the amount of 669 was less than 1 of the participants

Roy Lewis 6 November 1913  1996 was an English writer and small press printer

Although born in Felixstowe Lewis was brought up in Birmingham and educated at King Edwards School After studying at University College Oxford earning his BA in 1934 he went on to study at the London School of Economics He began his career as an economist but after serving as an editor on the journal Statist he became interested in journalism He took a sabbatical in 1938 to travel to Australia and India He married Christine Tew in 1939 after returning to England They had two daughters

Beginning in July 1939 he collaborated with Randal Heymanson to produce a newsletter called Vital News that they distributed confidentially to British and American government policymakers and bankers until December 1941

From 1943 to 1946 he worked for the Peking Syndicate a firm specialising in investments in China but left to work as a journalist for the weekly Scope Hired by the Economist magazine he served as its Washington DC correspondent from 1952 to 1961 He settled fulltime in England in 1961 where he became a feature writer for The Times remaining with the newspaper until he retired in 1971 In 1957 he had set up the Keepsake Press initially to hand print family ephemera He soon began serious though smallscale production and by the time infirmity forced him to discontinue in 1990 he had brought out over a hundred titles

The majority of the books that Lewis wrote or edited often jointly were nonfiction and closely related to his journalism However he is best known for his 1960 novel The Evolution Man which went through six editions under a number of titles This comic novel purports to be a firsthand account by the son of the first man to discover fire To prevent further advances the family takes matters in hand leading to a conclusion given away by the books eventual subtitle how I ate my father Continuing authorship into old age Lewis published a second novel in 1990 the same year that a play of his on William Shakespeare was performed in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe followed by a novella in 1991 and a further novel in 1995 All three of these later fictions were provocative reinterpretations of Victorian times

Lysyl oxidase
Lysyl oxidase LOX also known as proteinlysine 6oxidase is a protein that in humans is encoded by the LOX gene Its inhibition can cause osteolathyrism but at the same time its upregulation by tumor cells may promote metastasis of the existing tumor causing it to become malignant and cancerous

In the yeast strain Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase constitutes a homodimeric structure Each monomer consists of an active site that includes a CuII atom coordinated with three histidine residues as well as 245trihydroxyphenalanine quinone TPQ a crucial cofactor

In humans the LOX gene is located on chromosome 5q233312 The DNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 417 amino acids the first 21 residues of which constitute a signal peptide with a weight of approximately 32 kDa The carboxyterminus contains the active copper II ion lysine tyrosine and cysteine residues that comprise the catalytically active site The threedimensional structure of human lysyl oxidase has not yet been resolved

The mechanism of lysyl oxidase occurs via modification of the amino group of a lysine side chain The enzyme falls into the category of quinonecontaining copper amine oxidases and the reaction is highly dependent on the cofactor lysyl tyrosylquinone LTQ The LTQ cofactor is unique among quinones due to its orthobenzoquinone structure and neutral charge under physiological pH This can be contrasted with the similar ubiquitous quinocofactor TPQ which exists as a negatively charged structure under physiological conditions and includes orthoparacarbonyl resonance functionality

LTQ is crucial in LOXcatalyzed conversion of lysine residues to aminoadipidicsemialdehydes generally referred to as allysines In the oxidation of lysine the amine is first converted to a Schiff base via reaction with LTQ While LTQ is still bound to the substrate ratelimiting removal of the proton yields an imine intermediate Subsequent hydrolysis of the imine leads to release of the aldehyde product allysine Molecular oxygen and the copper ion are utilized to reoxidize the cofactor and yield another imine producing hydrogen peroxide as a side product Additional hydrolysis releases ammonia and the original cofactor completing the catalytic cycle

Lysyl oxidase is an extracellular copperdependent enzyme that catalyzes formation of aldehydes from lysine residues in collagen and elastin precursors These aldehydes are highly reactive and undergo spontaneous chemical reactions with other lysyl oxidasederived aldehyde residues or with unmodified lysine residues This results in crosslinking collagen and elastin which is essential for stabilization of collagen fibrils and for the integrity and elasticity of mature elastin

Complex crosslinks are formed in collagen pyridinolines derived from three lysine residues and in elastin desmosines derived from four lysine residues that differ in structure

The importance of lysyl oxidasederived crosslinking was established from animal studies in which lysyl oxidase was inhibited either by nutritional copperdeficiency or by supplementation of diets with aminopropionitrile BAPN an inhibitor of lysyl oxidase This resulted in lathyrism characterized by poor bone formation and strength hyperextensible skin weak ligaments and increased occurrence of aortic aneurysms These abnormalities correlated well with decreased crosslinking of collagen and elastin

Developmentally reduced lysyl oxidase levels have been implicated in Menkes disease and Occipital horn syndrome two Xlinked recessive disorders characterized by a mutation in a gene for copper transportation Thus not only is LOX crucial to cardiovascular development it is thought to play a major role in connective tissue development and may also be important in neurological function

Lysyl oxidase has also proven crucial to the development of the respiratory system and the skin as collagen and elastin represent 5060 of the composition of the lung and 75 of the skin In LOX double knockout models Lox  function of LOX was reduced by up to 80 and the phenotype of the lungs resembles those of human patients with emphysema and dilated distal airways

Finally lysyl oxidase plays a crucial role in the commitment step of adipocyte or fat cell formation from pluripotent stem cells during development Its absence may lead to defects in the transforming growth factor beta superfamily of proteins which control cell growth and differentiation

LOX expression is regulated by hypoxiainducible factors HIFs and hence LOX expression is often upregulated in hypoxic breast and head and neck tumors Patients with high LOXexpressing tumors have poor overall survival Furthermore inhibition of LOX has been demonstrated to eliminate metastases in mice Secreted LOX is responsible for the invasive properties of hypoxic cancer cells through focal adhesion kinase activity and celltomatrix adhesion LOX may be required to create a niche permissive for metastatic growth and thus may be required for hypoxiainduced metastasis In fact recent research has shown overexpression of LOX as crucial to promoting tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers including breast cancer melanoma nonsmall cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer

LOX expression was also detected in megakaryocytes or bone marrow cells responsible for the production of platelets Data derived from a mouse model of myelofibrosis implicated LOX in bone marrow fibrosis

In a rodent model of breast cancer a smallmolecule or antibody inhibitors of LOX abolished metastasis LOX secreted by hypoxic breast tumor cells crosslinks collagen in the basement membrane and is essential for CD11b myeloid cell recruitment CD11b cells in turn adhere to crosslinked collagen and produce matrix metalloproteinase2 which cleaves collagen enhancing the invasion of metastasizing tumor cells In contrast LOX inhibition prevents CD11b cell recruitment and metastatic growth

In cells lacking TGF receptors a deficiency that is characteristic of lung cancer lysyl oxidase is found in high concentrations LOX immunostaining has revealed that high LOX expression is associated with high extent of carcinoma invasion in samples obtained from surgically removed lung adenocarcinomas Additionally LOX expression is an indicator of 5year survival in patients with a 71 chance of survival for patients with low LOX levels compared to 43 for patients with high LOX levels Thus upregulation of lysyl oxidase is a predictor of poor prognosis in earlystage adenocarcinoma patients

Lysyl oxidase has been newly implicated in tumor angiogenesis or blood vessel formation both in vivo and in vitro Subcutaneous tumorderived LOX was shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF expression and secretion which then promotes angiogenesis by phosphorylation of protein kinase B or Akt through plateletderived growth factor receptor  PDGFRB High levels of LOX were associated with high blood vessel density in patient samples Clinically relevant LOX inhibitors may help slow cancer progression by downregulating crucial growth factors that promote solid tumor progression

Hence inhibitors of the LOX enzyme may be useful in preventing angiogenesis tumor progression and metastasis as well as treating other fibrotic disease involving remodeling of the extracellular matrix including neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases

VCord
VCord is an analog recording videocassette format developed and released by Sanyo VCord later referred to as VCord I was released in 1974 and could record 60 minutes on a cassette VCord II released in 1976 could record 120 minutes on a VCord II cassette

The VCord II machines were the first consumer VCRs to offer two recording speeds

The original VCord cassette had a large hub and was wound with standardthickness magnetic tape VCord II used a small hub wound with thin tape the same thickness later used for VHS120 and Beta L750 The cassettes were rectangular unlike subsequent formats VHS and Betamax which loaded with the tape facing front on the long side of the cassette the VCord cartridge was loaded sideways with the narrow side serving as the front and the tape coming out the side

The tape was held in place in the machine by a notch halfway down the right side of the tape similar to what holds an 8track tape into its player

The earliest machines recorded only in black and white and had no rewind mechanism like the Cartrivision format of a few years earlier an external rewinder was used after recording or playing a tape External rewinders were later used with the VHS and Beta formats although the machines could rewind tapes external rewinders were considerably faster than the rewind function

The system had two recording modes standard mode STD and a longplay mode LP which sacrificed recording quality for extra capacity In STD mode both recording and playback heads are used writing both fields of each interlaced video frame In longplay mode only a single head is used to record a single field from each video frame with each field being read twice on playback in a skip field technique The heads scanned the tape in a helical scan fashion 

Tape was moved forward at 291 inches per second in STD mode and 145 inches per second in LP mode this gave a recording time of onehour in standard mode and two hours in longplay mode Horizontal resolution in color was quoted as 250 lines in advertising materials stretching to 300 lines in blackandwhite with a video signaltonoise ratio of 45dB Audio response was specified as 80 to 10000Hz at 6dB in STD mode dropping to 80 to 8000Hz in LP mode

The tape was a halfinch cobalt doped tape with a 550 oersted coercivity The cassette measured 4 by 6 by 1 Two cassette types were available a V60 and a V120 whose names matched their recording capacity in LP mode The cassettes are similar in appearance to eighttrack cartridges

Conventional VHS and Beta formats recorded in a helical scan format resulting in angled tracks running from the lower edge of the tape to the upper edge some distance down Unlike these formats the VCord format was closer to the 2inch quadruplex videotape format used from the inception of video in the late 1950s until 2inch helical IVC videotape format was introduced twenty years later in that its tracks ran nearly perpendicular to tape travel

A portable fourhead video recorder the Sanyo VTC7100 used a similar format of cassette but produced incompatible recordings

Cliff Barnes
Clifford Cliff Barnes played by Ken Kercheval is a fictional character from the popular American television series Dallas The Barnes family are competitors and sometimes enemies of the Ewing family Cliff is the son of Willard Digger Barnes and Rebecca Barnes the older halfbrother of Pamela Barnes Ewing and Katherine Wentworth JR Ewing played by Larry Hagman was Cliffs personal nemesis with Cliff and JR continuing on the bitter feud that started with their fathers Digger Barnes and Jock Ewing from their oil wildcatting days in the 1930s Cliff and JR were the only two characters to appear throughout the entire run of the series A running gag on the series is Cliffs fondness for Chinese takeout

During the shows original conception the character of Cliff was modeled on the late Robert F Kennedy However he evolved into a bumbling sad sack who was very much his own worst enemy A lawyer and a bureaucrat not an oil man Cliff was out of his element when dealing in the cutthroat oil business and despite repeated attempts would always be outsmarted and outdone by his rival JR Thanks to Carter McKay Cliff finally beats JR in the final season and takes over Ewing Oil

Cliff had a close relationship with his sister Pamela played by Victoria Principal and hated that she married Bobby Ewing played by Patrick Duffy JRs younger brother

When Dallas began Cliff worked for the state of Texas building an impressive recorded reputation as investigator of corruption within the independent oil companies It was no coincidence that these investigations often cited or targeted Ewing Oil During the second and third seasons Cliffs career took an upward swing when he was appointed Chief of the Office of Land Management a fictional enormously powerful state agency that coordinated and approved all ventures that affected the surface and geological texture of Texas land including oil drilling permits In an attempt to lure Barnes out of this powerful position JR Ewing enlisted attorney Alan Beam in a scheme to form an exploratory funding committee funds solely provided by JR Ewing promoting Barnes as a candidate for the US Congress The scheme worked as Barnes resigned from his position to run for Congress After his resignation the money flow to the campaign stopped and Barnes was forced to drop out of the race

Cliff had an affair with JRs wife Sue Ellen played by Linda Gray during the second season of Dallas When Sue Ellen became pregnant it was believed Cliff was the father of her baby After a dizzy spell sent Digger to the doctor he was diagnosed as a carrier of neurofibromatosis a genetic disorder which hed passed on to Cliff As neurofibromatosis poses a greater threat to infants than to adults the doctor strongly advised them not to have children Cliff was worried that John Ross III might develop the potentially fatal disease but Bobby and Pam convinced him to keep quiet They all decided to monitor the babys health until he passed a critical age

After Cliff was forced to drop out of the Congressional race he quickly figured out that JR had been behind the plot and vowed revenge When a newspaper reporter interviewed Digger about Cliffs resignation he told her that Cliff was really the father of John Ross III Cliff realized that the scandal would embarrass JR and sued for custody In order to prove paternity blood tests had to be performed on Sue Ellen and JR The first test proved inconclusive but a second DNA test confirmed that JR was John Ross IIIs father after all

In a major step backwards Barnes took a position as a Dallas assistant district attorney Shortly after taking the position Barnes promoted the prosecution of Jock Ewing for a 30yearold murder which was dismissed after ironically Digger Barnes confessed to the murder on his deathbed In season four Cliff Barnes began working with State Senator Dave Culver believing that Culver the son of Sam Culver a Texas and national political icon would be destined for powerful office During this time Cliff also formed a personal relationship with Donna Culver played by Susan Howard who was Daves most trusted advisor and the widow of Sam Relations between Donna and Cliff soured and quickly ended when Dave was appointed to the US Senate and Donnas party committee chose Bobby Ewing instead of Barnes to run for his vacant state senate seat After Bobby Ewing won the senate race as a favor to wife Pam he asked Barnes to be his chief senate counsel Cliff accepted but after a short tenure they had a falling out over Cliffs decision without consulting Bobby to start a senate investigation against JR for alleged organization of a counterrevolution in Southeast Asia

In the course of the fourth season Cliffs mother Rebecca Wentworth played by Priscilla Pointer made a dramatic reentry into his life After much debating Cliff forgave her for her desertion It also delighted Cliff that his mother was an important lady who was wealthy and powerful in her own right Rebecca eventually offered him the presidency of Wentworth Tool  Die a small subsidiary of Wentworth Industries which made parts for oil rigs Cliff happily accepted and did extraordinarily well for a time Eventually Cliff asked for and received complete autonomy at Wentworth Tool  Die  but his fortunes took a dramatic downturn when he wasted Wentworth funds on a phony deal engineered by JR Cliffs mother subsequently sacked him  this coupled with Sue Ellens decision to remarry JR around the same time drove Cliff to attempt suicide

Cliff recovered and Rebecca subsequently bought out Wade Luce Oil renaming it BarnesWentworth Oil Rebecca asked Cliff to run the company for her and he accepted  blaming JR for Cliffs suicide attempt Rebecca encouraged Cliff to use the company and the place in the Cartel which came with it to gain revenge Armed with a new lease on life and a new hatred for the Ewings he became driven to succeed and as a result turned BarnesWentworth into a very successful company That year Cliff won the coveted Oil Man Of the Year award at the Oil Barons Ball However instead of enjoying his success he embarrassed himself by verbally trashing Jock Ewing and Ewing Oil during his acceptance speech resulting in a huge brawl

Rebecca died soon after from injuries sustained in a plane crash and Cliff inherited BarnesWentworth Oil as well as a third of Wentworth Industries much to the disgust of his half sister Katherine
During the fifth season Cliff and Sue Ellen became romantically involved again and he proposed marriage however she turned him down and eventually remarried JR Cliff did find happiness again with aspiring singer Afton Cooper played by Audrey Landers the sister of Lucy Ewings husband Mitch Cooper It would later transpire that Afton gave birth to a daughter Pamela Rebecca after the end of her relationship with Cliff At the start of the penultimate season it was revealed that Pamela was indeed Cliffs daughter although Afton disgusted by Cliffs lying to her tricked him into believing otherwise

Cliff married Jamie Ewing daughter of the late Jason Ewing and therefore a cousin of JR and Bobby played by Jenilee Harrison in 1985 but the union was unhappy at first Cliff having married Jamie purely for the inheritance he always believed to be his birthright During the 198586 season they realized how much they loved one another and became close In April 1986 Jamie was seen trapped in a blazing car and presumed dead But the entire 198586 season turned out to be the nightmare of Cliffs sister Pam So Cliff and Jamies happy marriage and her supposed death were just a dream and thus Cliff and Jamie never found happiness She left him in fall 1986 and the union was headed for a divorce when it was explained that Jamie was killed due to a fall while on a mountain climbing holiday

Cliff eventually realizes his dream of taking over a share of Ewing Oil and for a time enjoys a good personal and business relationship with Bobby whilst JR is temporarily sidelined from the business It is notable that Cliff and Bobby appear to find mutual respect and liking only after Pamela has gone and their family ties are effectively severed Cliff is also shown at this time to be a loving and attentive uncle to Christopher who is suffering from the absence of his mother Cliff enjoys a seemingly open welcome to Southfork during this time something that would have been unheard of in earlier seasons JR eventually returned to Ewing Oil and while they were briefly able to coexist it didnt last JRs maneuvering and Cliffs inattention to the business due to his attempts to win back Afton the only woman I ever loved soon had Cliff falling out of favor once again with the Ewings By the end of the series the feud that had characterized much of Dallass run was firmly back on

A theme of Cliff Barnes character was social class conflict with his nemesis JR Ewing Cliff had grown up poor in contrast to JR after the partnership between Cliffs father Digger and Jock Ewing dissolved due in large part to Diggers heavy drinking Jock went on to found Ewing Oil Digger blamed Jock for his subsequent bad luck and was jealous of Jocks wealth Cliff inherited Diggers resentment of the Ewings and as well as the tendency to sometimes drink heavily As time went on his hatred for the Ewings with the exception of JR dissipated as Cliff realized that his father was not blameless in regards to the BarnesEwing feud Throughout the series Cliff had a reputation for being cheap and naive in contrast to JR Whereas JR always dined in fine restaurants wore a stylish Stetson lived on Southfork and lavished his mistresses with generosity Cliff often preferred takeout Chinese cuisine wore cheap suits lived in a condominium and assumed his romantic interests would clean his home While JR was smooth talking and charismatic Cliff tended to speak before he thought and frequently stuck his foot in his mouth Much of the drama of Dallas was centered around Cliffs attempts to revenge himself against JR politically romantically and financially Typically Cliffs schemes failed because of JRs underhanded cleverness

Cliff eventually got one over JR shortly before the TV series ended when he took over Ewing Oil

In the series finale Conundrum in 1991 Cliff appears in JRs dream where with JR having never born he was never pulled into the BarnesEwing feud He became a lawyer who was married to a woman who loved him for himself not his money and had two grown children He turns out to have become Vice President of the United States and at a party learns the President has suffered a stroke and he will be soon taking office

Cliff appeared in the 1996 film  wherein after 5 years at Ewing Oil he decides he has had enough of the oil business and looks to sell Initially making a deal with West Star head Carter McKay he eventually sells the company to Bobby and Sue Ellen effectively ending the feud with JR when he decides that reuniting with his family Afton and his longlost daughter Pamela is more important than beating JR

Cliff reappeared in the 2012 continuation of the series which picks up 20 years after the original series concluded and ignores the events of the two 1990s TV movies

As the series begins Cliff is involved in a casino business He returns to Dallas and has a meeting with Bobby at Southfork Ranch Cliff wants to buy Southfork which Bobby has put up for sale JR walks in on their conversation and warns Cliff against trying to buy the Ewing family home Cliff later invites his adoptive nephew Christopher and his new wife Rebecca to dinner and expresses an interest in investing in Christophers energy project Christopher declines as he thinks that Cliff just wants to antagonize the Ewings again however Cliff warns him not to let the Ewings destroy him like they did his adoptive mother Pamela When JR arrives at Sue Ellens office to give her Miss Ellies pearls a good luck charm for her Texas gubernatorial campaign Cliff arrives to take Sue Ellen to lunch to discuss politics When questioned about trying to buy Southfork Cliff announces I will never stop fighting for what is rightfully mine

In addition sometime between the end of the original series and the 2012 continuation Cliff Barnes started a new company Barnes Global which owns hundreds of subsidiaries in over fifty countries His desire to spite the Ewing family persists and Cliff eventually directs the bombing of a methaneextracting rig belonging to Ewing Energies which results in the deaths of Christopher and Rebeccas two unborn children As an aside no mention was ever made of the neurofibromatosis gene that Cliff carries Years before hed vowed never to have children because he feared they could die of the disease As the gene is passed from the carrier to their offspring the risk that Rebecca or her children could suffer is high

The ensuing events result at the end of season two in the Ewings taking control of Barnes Global and folding it into a larger company known as Ewing Global with Cliff sitting in a Mexican jail charged with murdering JR Ewing However he managed to reach out to Elena Ramos and reveal more of JRs nefarious business tactics In a surprising twist he revealed to Elena her father had been fleeced out of the land JR managed to profit off of by having the deed to part of his familys land and her fathers land switched so Elenas father got the piece of land that lacked any oil As her father lost his life trying to find oil on it and her brother trafficked drugs to purchase the land back from the Ewings his revelation seemed to sway her He told Elena to make the Ewings pay for JRs sins against her family and gave her proxy over the onethird share of Barnes Global he still owned in the company

It is revealed in the season one finale that Christophers wife known to him as Rebecca Sutter is actually Cliffs daughter Pamela known in the original series as Pamela Rebecca Cooper Cliff is shown to be behind Rebeccas attempt to hustle Christopher

Although Pamela had discovered the Ewings had set up Cliff for the murder of JR she had chosen to leave Cliff in prison because he had blown up the rig and caused her to lose her unborn children She had however given him the deed to the land that Digger had deserved only at the expense of not being able to enjoy it Cliff was then left in prison

Kercheval stated that had Dallas not been cancelled he wouldnt have been back for a fourth season

A restaurant in Stockholms Vasastan district has operated under the name of the television character for at least two decades In the 1980s a German punk rock band went by the name Cliff Barnes and the Fear of Winning

Foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration
The foreign policy of the Bill Clinton administration was the foreign policy of the United States during the two term Presidency of Bill Clinton 1993 to 2001 Clintons main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M Christopher 199396 followed by Madeleine Albright 19972001 in his second term The Cold War had ended and the Soviet Union had disintegrated under his predecessor President George H W Bush whom Clinton criticized for being too preoccupied with foreign affairs The United States was the only remaining superpower with a military strength far overshadowing the rest of the world Absent the Cold War Clintons main priority was always domestic affairs especially the domestic economy Foreignpolicy took a backseat except to promote American trade and during unexpected emergencies His emergencies had to do with humanitarian crises which raised the issue of American or NATO or United Nations interventions to protect civilians or armed humanitarian intervention as the result of civil war state collapse or oppressive governments 

President George H W Bush had sent American troops on a humanitarian mission to Somalia but 18 of them were killed and 80 wounded in a botched raid in October 1993 Public opinion and most elite opinion swung heavily against foreign interventions that risked the lives of American soldiers when American national interests were not directly involved That meant humanitarian missions were problematic Clinton agreed and sent Ground troops only once to Haiti where none were hurt He sent the Air Force to do massive bombing in the former Yugoslavia but no American crewmen were lost The major trouble spots during his two terms were in Africa Somalia and Rwanda and Eastern Europe Bosnia Herzegovina and Kosovo in the former Yugoslavia Clinton also tried to resolve longrunning conflicts in Northern Ireland and the Middle East particularly the IsraeliPalestinian conflict
As a campaigner for election Clinton promised to devote his main attention to domestic policy in contrast to What he called the overemphasis on foreign policies by his opponent George H W Bush On taking office he told his top advisers he could only spare one hour a week meeting with them However Clinton had attended attended graduate school in England and increasingly took a personal interest in foreign affairs especially in his second term His main foreign policy advisors were Secretaries of State Warren M Christopher and Madeleine Albright and National Security Advisors Anthony Lake and Sandy Berger Other key advisors include Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Strobe Talbott who as Ambassador at large dealt with Russia and India

Political scientist Stephen Schlesinger argues that Warren Christopher was 

Realizing that increasing international trade would supports Clintons highest priority of economic growth Secretary of Commerce Ronald H Brown led delegations of entrepreneurs businessmen and financiers to South Africa Mexico Saudi Arabia Jordan Israel the West Bank Gaza Egypt Russia Brazil Argentina and Chile China and Hong Kong Ireland India and Senegal He was on a trade mission to wartorn Yugoslavia in 1996 when they all died in an accidental plane crash A special prosecutor was appointed when it was alleged that contributions to the Democratic Party enabled one to join the trade party Over its eight years in office the administration signed 300 trade agreements with other countries
The Chinese communist regime had crushed the prodemocracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989 President Bush voiced American outrage but quietly reassured the Chinese that trade would continue In the 1992 election campaign Clinton criticized Bush for not punishing China However when Clinton took office himself he continued the Bush policies Clintons highest priority was to maintain trade with China boost American exports expand investment in the huge Chinese market and create more jobs at home By granting China temporary most favoured nation status in 1993 his administration minimized tariff levels in Chinese imports Clinton initially conditioned extension of this status on Chinese human rights reforms but ultimately decided to extend the status despite a lack of reform 

In 1998 Clinton paid a friendly nineday visit to China Albright defended the trip by saying Engagement does not mean endorsement In 1999 Clinton signed a landmark trade agreement with China The agreementthe result of more than a decade of negotiationswould lower many trade barriers between the two countries making it easier to export US products such as automobiles banking services and motion pictures The Chinese citizens ability to afford and purchase US goods should have been taken into consideration However the agreement could only take effect if China was accepted into the WTO and was granted permanent normal trade relations status by the US Congress Under the pact the United States would support Chinas membership in the WTO Many Democrats as well as Republicans were reluctant to grant permanent status to China because they were concerned about human rights in the country and the impact of Chinese imports on US industries and jobs Congress however voted in 2000 to grant permanent normal trade relations with China In 2000 Clinton signed a bill granting permanent normal trade relations to China and American imports from China massively increased in the subsequent years Clintons last treasury secretary Lawrence Summers argued that Clintons trade policies were technically the largest tax cut in the history of the world in that they reduced prices on consumer goods by lowering tariffs

In 1993 Clinton worked with a bipartisan coalition in Congress to overcome objections by labor union and liberal Democrats They passed the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA that Bush had negotiated with Canada and Mexico in 1992 It joined the American Mexican and Canadian economies in a free trade pact It removed many restrictions of trade in agriculture textiles and automobiles provided new protections for intellectual property set up dispute resolution mechanisms and implemented new labor and environmental safeguards NAFTA cost jobs at first but in the long run it dramatically increased the trade among the three countries It increased the number of jobs in the United States but unions complained that it lowered wage rates for some workers However unions blocked his 1997 and 1998 proposals to provide the president with the power to quickly negotiate trade liberalization pacts with limited congressional comment Clintons advocacy of trade agreements sparked a backlash on the left among opponents of globalization A 1999 World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle Washington was overshadowed by major protests that descended into violence

The end of superpower rivalry had freed the UN and NATO and regional security institutions from their previous Cold War mindset and created new opportunities for them to play a more active collective role Despite international norms of state sovereignty and nonintervention the idea that the international community should intervene in a country for the good of its own people gained greater legitimacy International organizations such as the UN and regional security such as NATO the OAS and the OAU would play a role in bestowing legitimacy on the operations and in organizing a collective response Domestically however these new developments at the international level became enmeshed with a longstanding struggle between Congress and the president over war powers and differences in treaties between domestic and international understandings of the term Which branch of government was to control the deployment of American troops occupied these debates almost as much as the merits of the individual interventions These debates were not new with the struggle over war powers being a constant feature of American foreign policy especially since WWII when it first gained superpower status joined international organizations and signed its first mutual defense treaty in more that 150 years Clinton would utilize both the multinational cast and the explicit blessing of international organizations for support in most of these involvements These largely humanitarian operations during his term met much more congressional opposition and enjoyed less frequent congressional authorization than did operations during the Cold War This involvement suggests that the president had found international organizations to be a useful ally in part to decrease and to overcome the resistance of the national legislature

Just weeks before Clinton took office President George H W Bush had deployed American soldiers to Somalia a coastal nation on the Horn of Africa where people were suffering and dying from starvation and civil war The soldiers were sent to guard food and other relief supplies from being stolen by warring factions After soldiers faced fire from armed clans and 19 soldiers were killed in 1993 in the Battle of Mogadishu the mission quickly lost popularity with the American people Fearing chaos resulting in the starvation of Somalias civilians and to help US Forces defend themselves Clinton increased troop presence in the country Demands for withdrawal however grew louder and Clinton ordered troops out of the country in March 1994 This left Somalia in a state of chaos with warlords battling for control Public and elite opinion became strongly opposed to sending American ground troops on combat missions and Clinton agreed He did send ground troops to Haiti but none were engaged in combat He sent the Air Force into Yugoslavia for largescale bombing raids but no crewmen were lost

In April 1994 genocide in Rwanda erupted due to a longstanding conflict between the majority Hutu and dominant Tutsi ethnic groups In little more than 100 days Hutu militia massacred about 800000 Tutsi men women and children The small UN force on the scene was helpless European nations flew in to remove their own nationals then Flew out There was a strong consensus in the United States at both the elite and popular levels that the United States should not send in largescale combat forces to stop the massacres American officials avoided the word genocide because that would justify military intervention Clinton later called his inaction his worst mistake

The Hutu militia were highly effective in killing Tutu civilians but they were ineffective when a large Tutu armed force based in neighboring Uganda invaded in July seized full control of the entire nation of Rwanda By the end of July 1994 nearly two million Hutus fled the country for safety flooding into refugee camps in neighboring countries As many thousands of refugees died of disease and starvation Clinton ordered airdrops of food and supplies for the Hutu refugees including known genocidaires In July he sent 200 noncombatant troops to the Rwanda capital of Kigali to manage the airport and distribute relief supplies These troops were withdrawn by October 1994 Clinton and the United Nations faced criticism for their nonresponse to the genocide When Clinton traveled to Africa in 1998 he said that the international community presumably including the US must accept responsibility for the failure to respond to the massacres When speaking about the Rwanda Crisis Clinton called it his worst failure admitting I blew it During his African trip Clinton also referred to the concept of the new generation of African leaders

In August 1998 terrorists bombed the United States embassies in the capitals of two East African countries Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania About 250 people were killed including 12 Americans and more than 5500 were injured After intelligence linked the bombings to Osama bin Laden a wealthy Saudi Arabian living in Afghanistan who was suspected of terrorist activity Clinton ordered missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the bombings at the US embassies and to deter future terrorist attacks The Clinton administration maintained that the sitesa pharmaceutical factory at Khartoum the capital of Sudan and several alleged terrorist camps in Afghanistanwere involved in terrorist activities

Much of Clintons reluctant focus was the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina a nation in southeastern Europe that had declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 The Bush administration decided with the Cold War over Yugoslavia was no longer a high American priority Trouble there could be less left to Europe to handle But Clinton was outraged by the humanitarian disaster and decided to play a role This declaration was the catalyst of a war between Bosnian Serbs who wanted Bosnia to remain in the Yugoslav federation and Bosnian Muslims and Croats The Bosnian Serbs who were supported by Serbia were better equipped than the Muslims and the Croats as a result they populated and controlled much of the countryside in ways including besieging cities such as the capital of Sarajevo This caused widespread suffering and in response

In early 1993 the Clinton administration decided on aggressive action ignoring both the United Nations and key European allies The proposed policy was called lift and strike The plan was to lift the arms embargo the UN had imposed on all sides which left the Bosnian Muslims unarmed The US would arm them so they could defend themselves until they were fully prepared to fight for themselves the US would hit the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes to keep them back Christopher traveled to Europe to win support from Britain France and Germany but they were all staunchly opposed By the time Christopher returned to Washington support for the plan had evaporated based on memories of Vietnam and fears of being plunged into a chaotic war with no end in sight In 1994 Clinton opposed an effort by the Republicans in Congress to lift the arms embargo as it were because American allies were still resistant to that policy

Clinton continued to pressure western European countries throughout 1994 to take strong measures against the Serbs But in November as the Serbs seemed on the verge of defeating the Muslims and Croats in several strongholds Clinton changed course and called for conciliation with the Serbs After the 2nd Markale massacre in which Bosnian Serb forces reportedly shelled a crowded marketplace in Sarajevo NATO led by the United States launched Operation Deliberate Force with a series of airstrikes against Bosnian Serb targets In July 1995 as the tide of war was turning against the Bosnian Serbs local Bosnian forces under the command of General Ratko Mladi forced the surrender of the Bosnian stronghold of Srebrenica near the eastern border with Serbia A small UN force was helpless and the defenders surrendered with the promise that no civilians or soldiers would be harmed if they surrendered Instead Mladis forces massacred over 7000 Bosnians It was the worst massacre in Europe In 40 years and galvanized NATO Intervention The escalating air campaign along with a counteroffensive by betterequipped Muslim and Croatian forces succeeded in pressuring the Bosnian Serbs into participating in negotiations In November 1995 Clinton hosted peace talks between the warring parties in Dayton Ohio The parties reached a peace agreement known as the Dayton Agreement leaving Bosnia as a single state made up of two separate entities with a central government In 2011 Serbia was forced to turn over Mladi to the United Nations and in 2017 he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of genocide

According to historian David N Gibbs

In the spring of 1998 ethnic tension in the Federal Republic of Yugoslaviathe state formed from the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegroheightened when the military forces responded in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija More than 90 percent of the residents of Kosovo were Muslim and ethnic Albanians many of whom wanted independence from the country Yugoslav forces were mobilized into province to quell Albanian rebels

Through attempting to impose the Rambouillet Agreement Clinton who strongly supported the Albanians threatened the Yugoslav administration with military strikes On 24 March 1999 NATO led by the United States launched the twomonth bombardment of Yugoslavia The strikes were not limited to military installations and NATO targets included civilian targets such as factories oil refineries television stations and various infrastructure The intervention which devastated Yugoslavia was not approved by the UN General Assembly or the UN Security Council and was strongly opposed by both Russia and China It was the first time in NATOs history that its forces had attacked a sovereign country and the first time in which air power alone won a battle In June 1999 NATO and Yugoslav military leaders approved an international peace plan for Kosovo and attacks were suspended after Yugoslav forces withdrew from Kosovo

Clinton also sought to end the conflict in Northern Ireland by arranging a peace agreement between the nationalist and unionist factions In 1998 former Senator George Mitchellwhom Clinton had appointed to assist in peace talkssupported an accord that became known as the Good Friday Agreement It called for the British Parliament to devolve legislative and executive authority of the province to a new Northern Ireland Assembly whose Executive would include members of both communities Years of stalemate have followed the agreement mainly due to the refusal of the Provisional Irish Republican Army IRA a nationalist paramilitary group to decommission its weapons for some years and after that the refusal of the Democratic Unionist Party to push the process forward Mitchell returned to the region and arranged yet another blueprint for a further peace settlement that resulted in a December 1999 formation of the powersharing government agreed the previous year which was to be followed by steps toward the IRAs disarmament That agreement eventually faltered as well although Clinton continued peace talks to prevent the peace process from collapsing completely In 2005 the IRA decommissioned all of its arms and in 2007 Sinn Fin expressed a willingness to support the reformed Police Service of Northern Ireland PSNI Power was restored to the Assembly in May 2007 marking renewed promise for the fulfillment of the Good Friday Agreement

Clinton was likewise deeply involved in the Middle East peace process to negotiate peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians as well as with the governments of Egypt Jordan Syria and Lebanon Secret negotiations mediated by Clinton between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat led to a historic declaration of peace in September 1993 called the Oslo Accords Clinton personally arranged for the peace accord to be signed at the White House on September 13 1993 The agreement allowed a limited Palestinian selfrule in the Israelioccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip Following up after Oslo Secretary of State Christopher encouraged Jordans King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel Christopher offered Hussein 200 million in military equipment and 700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal On October 27 1994 Rabin and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdelsalam alMajali signed the IsraelJordan peace treaty It was the second piece treaty for Israel after Egypt Christopher sought to obtain a Third treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez alAssad but to no avail

The 1993 and 1995 peace agreements between Israel and Palestine however did not end the conflict in the Middle East As the peace process came to a stall Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to peace talks on the Wye River in October 1998 The two leaders signed yet another agreement known as the Wye River Memorandum which called for Israel to transfer more territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians In return the Palestinians agreed to take steps to curb terrorism They also agreed to a timetable to negotiate a final resolution of the Palestinian fight for an independent state

After an abrupt outbreak of violence sparked by the agreement however Netanyahu refused to cede any more West Bank territory and placed new demands upon Palestine His ceding of territory had shaken his own coalition though and together with other factors this contributed to the downfall of the Netanyahu government in Israel As a result in May 1999 Israelis elected Ehud Barak the leader of a political coalition that favored resuming the peace process to replace Netanyahu as prime minister Clinton continued to work passionately on negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians Throughout his last year in office Clinton came close to arranging a final peace settlement but failed according to Clinton as a result of Arafats reluctance Clinton related a phone conversation he had with Arafat three days before he left office You are a great man Arafat said Clinton replied The hell I am Im a colossal failure and you made me one

Clinton was also confronted with problems in Iraq In 1991 two years before Clinton became president the United States under President George H W Bush participated in the Persian Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation In 1991 the warring parties signed a ceasefire agreement and the United Nations Security Council passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 requiring Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction and allow inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission UNSCOM to monitor the countrys adherence to the agreement In addition to UN inspections to ensure the Iraqi compliance of Resolution 688 which called for Iraq to end its oppression of Iraqi citizens the nofly zones over Iraq were established by the US and its allies to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and the Shiites in southern Iraq from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government

On June 26 1993 Clinton ordered a cruise missile attack on the Iraqi Intelligence Services IIS principal command and control complex in Baghdad publicly announced as retaliation for the assassination attempt by the IIS on former President George H W Bush while he was visiting Kuwait in April of that year to commemorate a coalition victory over Iraq in the Gulf War Fourteen cruise missiles were launched from and nine of them launched from  Sixteen hit the target while three struck a residential area killing nine civilians and wounding 12 others Four missiles were unaccounted for This strike was in violation of international law although that point is contentious

In October 1994 Baghdad once again began mobilizing around 64000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border because of their expressed frustrations of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council UNSC In response the US begins to deploy troops in the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait Codenamed Operation Vigilant Warrior 1st Brigade of the Fort Stewart Georgiabased 24th Infantry Division Mechanized deployed and drew prepositioned equipment in Kuwait The 23rd Wings Flying Tigers 75th Fighter Squadron Tigersharks and its full complement of A10s initially deployed from Pope AFB North Carolina to Dhahran Air Base Saudi Arabia followed by the first forward deployment to Ahmad alJaber Air Base Kuwait This allowed better facetoface coordination with tactical air control parties TACP assets further forward deployed at Camp Doha Kuwait and points north Iraq would later withdraw troops near the Kuwaiti border in response to a massive US military buildup This served to increase US and Coalition resolve to contain Iraqi aggression against their neighbors in the Middle East

In September 1996 Clinton ordered Operation Desert Strike and ships from the Battle Group including  and  in conjunction with B52 bombers escorted by F14D Tomcats from USS Carl Vinson launched 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi air defense targets in southern Iraq A second wave of 17 was launched later that day The missiles hit targets in and around Kut Iskandariyah Nasiriyah and Tallil This was done in response to Saddam Hussein an Iraqi dictator attempting to launch an Iraqi military offensive campaign in the Kurdish town of Arbil in Iraqi Kurdistan

In his 1998 State of the Union Address Clinton warned the US Congress of Husseins possible pursuit of nuclear weapons saying

The UNSCOM team faced resistance from Iraq which blocked inspections and hid deadly germ agents and warheads Clinton then threatened military action several times when Hussein who turned out to be Iraqs President tried stalling the UNSCOM inspections To weaken Husseins grip of power Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on October 31 1998 which instituted a policy of regime change against Iraq though it explicitly stated it did not speak to the use of American military forces Between December 16 and 19 1998 Clinton ordered fourday period of concentrated air attacks against military installations in Iraq This was in response to Saddams refusal to cooperate with UN inspectors After the bombing Hussein blocked any further UN inspections and announced its attempt to shoot down Coalition aircraft in the nofly zones over Iraq For several years afterward US and Coalition aircraft routinely attacked hostile Iraqi defense installations in Iraq in response to what the Clinton administration claimed were provocations by the Iraqi military including antiaircraft fire and radar locks on US and Coalition aircraft

The UN sanctions against Iraq that the United Nations Security Council imposed after the Gulf War remained in place during the Clinton administration These sanctions were alleged to have contributed to increased child mortality there although this was disputed Albright later wrote Saddam Hussein could have prevented any child from suffering simply by meeting his obligations Recent research has shown that commonly cited data were fabricated by the Iraqi government and that there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions

President Clintons foreign policy team initially viewed Iran with suspicion and sought to contain Iranian ambitions as part of the dual containment strategy On May 6 1995 Clinton signed Executive Order 12957 which implemented tight oil and trade sanctions on Iran and made it illegal for American corporations or their foreign subsidiaries to participate in any contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran On May 6 1995 President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 which banned almost all trade between US businesses and the Iranian government with the exception of informational materials
A year before the President declared that Iran was a state sponsor of terrorism and a rogue state marking the first time that an American President used that term

In 1996 the Clinton administration agreed to compensate the Iranian government for the deaths of 254 Iranians in a 1988 incident in which an Iranian commercial passenger plane was shot down by mistake by an American warship the USS Vincennes In Clintons second term as President beginning in 1997 the administration began to take a softer approach towards Iran particularly after the election of reformist Mohammad Khatami as President of Iran

In 1995 Albright and Clinton mandated what could be considered an apology to the Iranian people for the 1953 CIAassisted coup that overthrew the Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh and replaced him with the Shah Albright and Clinton also acknowledged that the USbacked government of the Shah oppressed political opponents In the months that followed an Iranian professional wrestling team was allowed entry into the US to face American teams and a significant increase in cultural and academic overtures were made between the two countries In 1998 Iran and the United States faced each other in a game at the FIFA World Cup that year Iran beat the US by 21 Khatami also encouraged Americans to travel to Iran for vacational purposes citing the city of Esfahan a popular location for tourists where according to CNN several wellpreserved sites often surprise tourists In a wellpublicized 1997 interview Khatami refused to fully apologize for the 79 hostage crisis in which 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days yet did offer to open up a dialogue with the American people

Clinton at one point offered to open up an official dialogue with the Iranian government and renew diplomatic relations with the country after 20 years of no such relations However Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused to accept the offer for dialogue unless the US formally withdrew its support for Israel lifted the 95 sanctions imposed on the country stopped accusing Tehran of attempting to develop nuclear weaponry and officially ended its policy of considering Iran a rogue state that sponsors terrorism Although Clinton did privately weigh the idea of revoking the executive orders he signed in the spring of 1995 the administration refused to comply with Irans other demands

Eventually President Clinton did ease restrictions on export of food and medical equipment to Iran Albright announced in 2000 that the US would begin to enable Americans to purchase and import carpets and food products such as dried fruits nuts and caviar from Iran and also was confident that Iran would provide cooperation with the United States in the battle against narcotics and international drug abuse In 1995 the State Department warned US citizens against traveling in Iran due to that governments rampant antiAmericanism yet five years later Albright decided to repeal this warning

By the time Clinton left office in January 2001 it was clear that relations between Iran and the United States had significantly cooled despite the fact that President Khatami and President Clinton failed to initiate an official diplomatic dialogue between the nations something which has not existed since the 1979 hostage crisis

In 1994 the Clinton administration announced that it was lifting the trade embargo on Vietnam citing progress on the Vietnam War POWMIA issue regarding the search for American soldiers listed as missing in action and the remains of those killed in action as well as the market reforms that Vietnam implemented from 1986 On July 10 1995 Clinton announced that his administration was restoring full diplomatic relations with Vietnam citing the continued progress in determining the whereabouts of MIAs and locating the remains of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War Clinton nonetheless stressed that the search for Americans would continue especially for the soldiers listed as discrepancies namely 55 American soldiers believed to still be alive when they went missing On November 16 2000 Clinton arrived in Hanoi with his wife Senatorelect Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea shortly before his second term in office ended The next day Clinton spoke to the Vietnamese people publicly about both the conflict as well as the promise renewed relations meant

In 1995 tense relations with China and the imprisonment of an innocent American in the Communist nation led to pressure for the US to boycott the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing The US delegation chaired by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Madeleine Albright then the United States Ambassador to the United Nations was assigned with the task of confronting China about its human rights abuses but not so strongly as to damage sensitive relations Hillary Rodham Clinton gave a successful speech before the entire Chinese leadership and the Conference where she without bringing up China or any particular nation attacked human rights abuses against humanity in general and women and girls in particular

In 199596 the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis happened between Taiwan and China Chinese concerns about the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election as well as the possibility of the declaration of Taiwanese independence led to a series of missile tests right off the coast of Taiwan that could have escalated out of control The Clinton administration responded in March 1996 by staging the biggest display of American military might in Asia since the Vietnam War Numerous aircraft carrier groups were stationed near Taiwan and her group as well as sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a demonstration of support for Taiwan Eventually a ceasefire was declared and China declared the missile tests to be completed

North Koreas feared aim to create nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was a serious problem for the Clinton Administration In 1994 North Korea a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty refused to allow international inspectors to review two nuclear waste sites The inspectors wanted to see if North Korea was in violation of the treaty since they were suspected of reprocessing spent fuel into plutonium which could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons Despite diplomatic pressure and repeated warnings by Clinton North Korea refused to allow the inspections and even raised the prospect of war with South Korea an ally of the United States In 1994 Clinton also considered a US military strike on bombing the Yongbyon nuclear reactor He was advised that if war broke out it could cost 52000 US and 490000 South Korean military casualties in the first three months as well as a large number of civilian casualties
With private diplomacy by former president Jimmy Carter the Clinton administration reached a breakthrough with North Korea in October 1994 when North Korea agreed to shut down the nuclear plants that could produce materials for weapons if the United States would help North Korea build plants that generated electricity with lightwater nuclear reactors These reactors would be more efficient and their waste could not easily be used for nuclear weaponry The United States also agreed to supply fuel oil for electricity until the new plants were built and North Korea agreed to allow inspection of the old waste sites when construction began on the new plants KEDO was established based on this agreement in 1995

This 1994 Agreed Framework as it was known kept the Yongbyon plutonium enrichment plant closed and under international inspection until 2002 However economic supports by the agreement and KEDO gave an advantage to North Korea and North Korea broke off from the treaty and restarted plutonium production In October 2006 North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon President Bush warned that he was not pleased by such actions as it is he invited the international community to take a stand As a result North Korea the United States Russia China were involved in negotiations and North Korea agreed to close down their nuclear station temporarily

The 1991 Haitian coup dtat led by Lieutenant General Raoul Cdras had ousted the countrys elected president JeanBertrand Aristide who barely escaped to the United States Shortly thereafter tens of thousands of Haitians also tried to flee to the United States in leaky boats in 1993 increased opposition to Aristide supporters would increase these numbers Relatively few refugees would be allowed legal entry with most being sent back to Haiti or Guantanamo by the United States Coast Guard Clinton had previously criticized former President George H W Bush for doing much the same

American opinion generally favored Aristide but opposed military intervention Clinton was highly sensitive to his black constituency and the black leadership in Congress pushed for action Vice President Gore and advisor Anthony Lake strongly agreed while Sandy Berger Strobe Talbott Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry went along Clinton agreed but worried about going against the democratic will in his own country to enforce democracy in some other country On September 15 1994 Clinton tried to rally American public opinion with a forceful televised address from the Oval Office He denounced the military junta as armed thugs engaged in a reign of terror executing children raping women killing priests Clinton demanded it leave immediately As American warplanes were being readied for an invasion suddenly former President Jimmy Carter proposed to negotiate a settlement Clinton agreed that Carter Colin Powell and Senator Sam Nunn would fly to Haiti to convince the junta to leave In a matter of 48 hours Carters group achieved the desired transfer of power without any violence In Operation Uphold Democracy American forces landed after the departure of the junta Anthony Lake attributed the success to a combination of power and diplomacy Without Clintons threat of force the junta would never have left Without Carter there would have been fighting Aristide returned to power and Clintons prestige was enhanced Nevertheless six years later conditions were still terrible in Haiti 

After securing the NAFTA treaty that integrated the Mexican and American economies Clinton faced yet another foreign crisis in early 1995 The Mexican peso began to fall sharply and threatened the collapse of the Mexican economy Clinton feared that a collapse would have a negative impact on the United States because of their close economic ties He proposed a plan to address the financial crisis in Mexico but many in Congress hearting that constituents would not favor aid money to Mexico rejected the plan In response Clinton used executive authority to create a 20 billion loan package for Mexico to restore international confidence in the Mexican economy The loan Went through and Mexico completed its loan payments to the United States in January 1997 three years ahead of schedule However issues such as drug smuggling and immigration continued to strain relations

American foreign policy toward Cuba had been hostile since Fidel Castro aligned the country with the Soviet Union in 1960 Clinton basically continue the policy especially regarding trade embargoes but he faced a difficult problem on what to do with Cuban refugees trying to reach asylum in the United States

After negotiations with representatives of the Cuban government Clinton revealed in May 1995 a controversial policy reversing the decadesold policy of automatically granting asylum to Cuban refugees Approximately 20000 Cuban refugees detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba were to be admitted to the United States over a period of three months In order to prevent a mass exodus of refugees to the United States all future refugees would be returned to Cuba The influx of refugees into Guantanamo Bay overwhelmed the facilities necessitating Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage involving Panama Clinton also implemented the wet footdry foot policy for Cuban refugees This policy meant that Cuban refugees caught at sea were returned to Cuba wet foot while Cuban refugees that made it to dry land dry foot were allowed to stay in the US This changed the refugees tactics from slow rafts to speed boats

Relations between the United States and Cuba deteriorated in February 1996 when Cuba shot down two American civilian planes Cuba accused the planes of violating Cuban airspace Clinton tightened sanctions against Cuba and suspended charter flights from the United States to Cuba hoping this would cripple Cubas tourism industry

In their response to the incident the US Congress passed the HelmsBurton Act in March 1996 The bill strengthened an embargo against imports of Cuban products Title III however made the bill controversial because it allowed American citizens whose property was seized during and after the 1959 Cuban Revolution to sue in American courts foreign companies that later invested in those properties Title III sparked an immediate uproar from countries such as Mexico Canada and members of the European Union because they believed that they would be penalized for doing business with Cuba In response Clinton repeatedly suspended Title III of the legislation the act gave the president the right to exercise this option every six months

Clinton softened his Cuban policy in 1998 and 1999 In March 1998 at the urging of Pope John Paul II Clinton lifted restrictions and allowed humanitarian charter flights to resume He also took steps to increase educational religious and humanitarian contacts in Cuba The US government decided to allow Cuban citizens to receive more money from American friends and family members and to buy more American food and medicine

On February 26 1993 thirtysix days after Clinton took office terrorists who the CIA would later reveal were working under the direction of Osama bin Laden detonated a timed car bomb in the parking garage below Tower One of the World Trade Center in New York City see the World Trade Center bombing Clinton responded by ordering his National Security Council under the direction of Anthony Lake and the FBI to find and punish those responsible The FBI was able to quickly identify the vehicle used in the bomb from a remnant found in the rubble a Ryder rental van which had been reported stolen in Jersey City New Jersey the day before The truck was rented by Mohammed Salameh whom the FBI immediately detained Similar evidence led to the arrests of other plotters behind the attack including Nidal Ayyad Mahmoud Abouhalima Ahmad Ajaj and Ramzi Yousefwho was identified as the key player in the bombing All men were tried and convicted for the bombing and other terrorists activities

In his 1995 State of the Union address Clinton proposed comprehensive legislation to strengthen our hand in combating terrorists whether they strike at home or abroad He sent legislation to Congress to extend federal criminal jurisdiction make it easier to deport terrorists and act against terrorist fundraising Following the bombing of the Alfred P Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City Clinton amended that legislation to increase wiretap and electronic surveillance authority for the FBI require explosives to be equipped with traceable taggants and appropriate more funds to the FBI CIA and local police

In June 1995 Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 39 which stated that the United States should deter defeat and respond vigorously to all terrorist attacks on our territory and against our citizens Furthermore it called terrorism both a matter of national security and a crime The implementation of his proposals led to a substantial increase in counterterrorism funds for the FBI and CIA

In 1996 the CIA established a special unit of officers to analyze intelligence received about bin Laden and plan operations against him coined the Bin Laden Issue Station It was this unit that first realized bin Laden was more than just a terrorist financier but a leader of a global network with operations based in Afghanistan Given these findings the NSC encouraged the Department of State to pay more attention to Afghanistan and its governing unit the Taliban which had received funding from bin Laden The State Department requested the Taliban to expel bin Laden from the country noting that he was a sponsor of terrorism and publicly urged Muslims to kill Americans The Taliban responded that they did not know his whereabouts and even if they did he was not a threat to the United States The CIAs counterterrorism division quickly began drafting plans to capture and remove bin Laden from the country However Marine General Anthony Zinni and some in the State Department protested the move saying that the United States should focus instead on ending the Afghan civil war and the Talibans human rights abuses

In 1998 Clinton appointed Richard Clarkewho until then served in a drugs and counterterrorism division of the CIAto lead an interagency comprehensive counterterrorism operation the Counterterrorism Security Group CSG The goal of the CSG was to detect deter and defend against terrorist attacks Additionally Clinton appointed Clarke to sit on the cabinetlevel Principals Committee when it met on terrorism issues

Clintons Counterterrorism Center began drafting a plan to ambush bin Ladens compound in Kandahar The CIA mapped the compound and identified the houses of bin Ladens wives and the location where he most likely slept The plan was relatively simple at least on paper Tribals would subdue the guards enter the compound take bin Laden to a desert outside Kandahar and hand him over to another group of tribals This second group would carry him to a desert landing stripwhich had already been testedwhere a CIA plane would take him to New York for arraignment When they completed a draft plan they ran through two rehearsals in the United States Confident that the plan would work the Counterterrorism Center of the CIA sought the approval of the White House While they acknowledged that the plan was risky they stated that there was a risk in not acting because sooner or later bin Laden will attack US interests perhaps using WMD

Clarke reviewed the plans for Sandy Berger the National Security Director and told him that it was in the very early stages of development and stressed the importance of only targeting bin Laden not the entire compound The NSC told the CIA to begin preparing the necessary legal documents to execute the raid

The senior management of the CIA was skeptical of the plan and despite objections canceled the operation fearing that the risk to their operatives and financial costs were too high It is unclear whether or not Clinton was aware of the plan

As the Counterterrorism Center continued to track bin Laden they learned in 1998 that the Saudi government had bin Laden cells within the country that were planning attacks on US forces CIA Director George Tenet encouraged by the Saudis show of force against bin Laden asked them to assist in the fight against bin Laden Clinton named Tenet as his informal personal representative to work with Saudi Arabia on terrorism The Saudis promised Tenet that they would do everything they could to convince the Taliban to release bin Laden for trial in America or elsewhere The Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal held various meetings with Taliban chief Mullah Omar and other leaders and received assurance that bin Laden would be removed Omar however reneged on that promise

On August 7 1998 Bin Laden struck again this time with simultaneous bombings on the US embassies in Nairobi Kenya and Dar es Salaam Tanzania see above The CIA having confirmed bin Laden was behind the attack informed Clinton that terrorist leaders were planning to meet at a camp near Khowst to plan future attacks According to Tenet several hundred including bin Laden would attend On August 20 Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on AlQaeda terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum Sudan where bin Laden was suspected of manufacturing biological weapons While the military hit their targets bin Laden was not killed The CIA estimated that they had missed bin Laden by a few hours

At the time of the attacks Clinton was embroiled in the Lewinsky scandal see below This led many Republicans in Congress to accuse the president of wagging the doglaunching a military attack simply to distract the public from his personal problems Clinton and his principals however insist that the decision was made solely on the basis of national security

After the attacks failed Clinton moved his focus to diplomatic pressure On the advice of the State Department Clinton encouraged Pakistan whose military intelligence agency was a patron of the Taliban to pressure the Taliban to remove bin Laden After numerous meetings with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif the Pakistanis would still not cooperate Sharif eventually agreed to allow the United States to train Pakistani special forces to find bin Laden When Sharif was ousted by Pervez Musharraf the plan was abandoned

After encouragement by Richard Clarke Clinton issued an executive order in July 1999 declaring the Taliban regime as a state sponsor of terrorism This was followed in October 1999 by Resolution 1267 sponsored by the United States placing economic and travel sanctions on the Taliban The Taliban however stood by bin Laden and the United States along with Russia proposed yet another UN resolution Resolution 1333 this time imposing an embargo an arms shipments to the Taliban The move was meant to weaken the Taliban in their fight against the Northern Alliance in their civil strife However the resolution did little to limit the illegal flow of arms from Pakistan

In August 1999 Clinton signed a Memorandum of Notification ordering the CIA to develop another plan to capture bin Laden and giving the CIA the authority to order bin Laden be killed

Near the end of 1999 the Clinton administration working with the government of Jordan detected and thwarted a planned terrorist attack to detonate bombs at various New Year millennium celebrations around the world The CIA confirmed that bin Laden was behind the plot which was disrupted just days before the New Year While many credited Clintons new CSG for playing a role in the foiling of these plots critics claim it was mostly luck

The CIA informed Clinton that they feared the thwarted attacks were just part of a larger series of attacks planned for the new year Clinton asked Clarke and the CSG to draft plans to deter and disrupt al Qaeda attacks

On October 12 2000 terrorists bombed USS Cole in the harbor of the Yemeni port of Aden The attack on  a US Navy destroyer killed 17 Navy sailors and there was no clear indication during the last months of Clintons term of who was responsible The CIA reported that they had no definitive answer on the crucial question of outside direction of the attackhow and by whom Clinton did not think it would be wise to launch an attack based on a preliminary judgment stating that he would have taken further action had he received definitive intelligence The CIA was eventually able to confirm bin Ladens involvement with certainty a week after the Bush administration took office

As Clintons second term drew to a close the CSG drafted a comprehensive policy paper entitled Strategy for Eliminating the Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al Qida Status and Prospects The paper outlined a method to roll back al Qaeda over a period of three to five years Clarke stated that while continued antial Qida operations at the current level will prevent some attacks it will not seriously attrit their ability to plan and conduct attacks This policy paper was forwarded to the incoming Bush administration

In the years since September 11 2001 Clinton has been subject to criticism that he failed to capture Osama bin Laden as President In a September 24 2006 interview with Fox News Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday Clinton challenged his critics According to Clinton he faced criticism from various conservatives during his administration for being too obsessed with Bin Laden Clinton also noted that his administration created the first comprehensive antiterrorist operation led by Richard Clarkewhom Clinton accuses the Bush Administration of demoting Clinton also said he worked hard to try to kill Bin Laden Former international negotiator and current businessman financier and media commentator Mansoor Ijaz claimed that from 19961998 he had opened up unofficial negotiations with Sudan to lift terrorism sanctions from that country in exchange for intelligence information about the terrorist groups Islamic Jihad Hezbollah and Hamas He claimed that Sudan was also prepared to offer custody of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden who had been living in the country and launching operations According to Ijaz neither Clinton nor National Security Advisor Sandy Berger responded to the situation Bin Laden later left Sudan and established his operations in Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban and with his network planned out terrorist attacks against American interests worldwide including attacks on American embassies in Tunisia and Sudan as well as the bombing of USS Cole The most infamous were the attacks of September 11 2001 that occurred under Clintons successor George W Bush nine months after Clinton left office However the 911 Commission Report later found no credible evidence to support the Sudan custody offer as the American Ambassador to the Sudan had no legal basis to ask for custody due to no indictment against Bin Laden

Sudans minister of defense Fatih Erwa has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the United States The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since at the time there was no indictment outstanding 

Clinton acknowledged that following the bombing on USS Cole his administration prepared battle plans to execute a military operation in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and search for bin Laden The plans were never implemented because according to Clinton the CIA and FBI refused to certify that bin Laden was responsible for the bombing until after he left office and the military was unable to receive basing rights in Uzbekistan In relation to Afghanistan Clinton criticized the Bush Administration when he said We do have a government that thinks Afghanistan is oneseventh as important as Iraq Clinton also said that his administration left the plans and a comprehensive antiterror strategy with the new Bush Administration in January 2001

In 2014 a September 10 2001 audio containing Clintons conservation at a business center at Melbourne Australia 10 hours before the 911 attacks regarding the topic of terrorism was revealed In this audio Clinton stated that according to intelligence agencies Bin Laden was located in Kandahar Afghanistan in December 1998 and thus a missile strike was proposed However he decided not to kill Bin Laden because of conflicting reports of intelligence information to his true whereabouts as well as the potential risk for civilian casualties He stated that Im just saying you know if I were Osama bin Ladenhes a very smart guy Ive spent a lot of time thinking about himand I nearly got him once And then he said that I nearly got him And I could have killed him but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children and then I would have been no better than him And so I didnt do it

In 1996 Clinton signed the United States onto the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT a landmark international agreement that prohibited all signatory nations from testing nuclear weapons The following year he sent the treaty to the Senate for ratification Conservative Republicans took the lead in defeating the treaty in October 1999 by vote of 48 in favor and 51 against far short of the two thirds It needed to pass International reaction to the Senates action was uniformly negative and the rejection was a political setback for Clinton who had lobbied actively for its approval One scholar blames the failure on

Despite the rejection of the treaty Clinton promised that the United States would continue to maintain a policy of not testing nuclear weapons which had been in place since 1992

Throughout the 1990s the Congress refused to appropriate funds for the United States to pay its dues to the United Nations By 1999 the United States owed the UN at least 1 billion in back dues That same year Clinton reached a compromise with Republicans in Congress to submit more than 800 million in back dues Republicans in the House of Representatives had insisted that UN debt repayments be accompanied by restrictions on US funding for international groups that lobbied for abortion rights in foreign countries Clinton had vetoed similar measures in the past but he agreed to the restrictions when faced with the prospect that the United States would lose its vote in the UN General Assembly for nonpayment of dues

During his first term argues two political scientists

Public opinion in the United States about the role the country should have in the Bosnian genocide was negative A series of Gallup polls through 19951997 showed that public disapproval of military intervention in Bosnia hovered around 52 with the only outlier occurring in January 1997 where 58 of the population disapproved The polls also found that public opposition was bipartisan with 49 of Republicans and around 40 of Democrats and Independents disapproving

Americans were even less supportive of involvement in Kosovo A Gallup poll in March 1999 showed that about half of the American public supported NATO air strikes in Yugoslavia That was the weakest support for any American combat mission in the past decade Fewer people were following the news about US involvement in Kosovo falling from 43 to 32 in two months

The public and the media paid little attention to the Rwanda genocide One reason why the United States did not enter Rwanda is because of the public reluctance to enter combat after the Vietnam War

Androgen replacement therapy
Androgen replacement therapy ART often referred to as testosterone replacement therapy TRT is a form of hormone therapy in which androgens often testosterone are replaced ART is often prescribed to counter the effects of male hypogonadism It typically involves the administration of testosterone through injections skin creams patches gels or subcutaneous pellets

ART is also prescribed to lessen the effects or delay the onset of normal male aging However this is controversial and is the subject of ongoing clinical trials As men enter middle age they may notice changes caused by a relative decline in testosterone fewer erections fatigue thinning skin declining muscle mass and strength andor more body fat Dissatisfaction with these changes causes some middle age men to seek ART

Androgen replacement is the classic treatment of hypogonadism It is also used in men who have lost the ability to produce androgens due to disease or its treatment

The risks of diabetes and of testosterone deficiency in men over 45 ie hypogonadism specifically hypoandrogenism are strongly correlated Testosterone replacement therapies have been shown to improve blood glucose management Still it is prudent not to start testosterone therapy in men with diabetes solely for the purpose of improving metabolic control if they show no signs and symptoms of hypogonadism

Androgen replacement is used in postmenopausal women the indications are to increase sexual desire and to prevent or treat osteoporosis The androgens used for androgen replacement in women include testosterone and esters prasterone dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA and the ester prasterone enanthate methyltestosterone nandrolone decanoate and tibolone among others

The Food and Drug Administration FDA stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging The FDA has required that testosterone labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke

On January 31 2014 reports of strokes heart attacks and deaths in men taking testosteronereplacement led the FDA to announce that it would be investigating this issue The FDAs action followed three peerreviewed studies of increased cardiovascular events and deaths Due to an increased rate of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group a randomized trial stopped early Also in November 2013 a study reported an increase in deaths and heart attacks in older men Even after a correction was published the Androgen Study Group a group with many members who have relationships with drug companies in the testosterone market requested JAMA to retract the article as misleading due to substantial residual errors Concerns have been raised that testosterone was being widely marketed without the benefit of data on efficacy and safety from large randomized controlled trials As a result of the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes the FDA announced in September 2014 a review of the appropriateness and safety of testosterone replacement therapy

There are several artificial androgens many of which are manipulations of the testosterone molecule referred to as anabolicandrogenic steroids Androgen replacement is administered by patch tablet pill cream or gel or depot injections given into fat or muscle

Other significant adverse effects of testosterone supplementation include acceleration of preexisting prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation increased hematocrit which can require venipuncture in order to treat and exacerbation of sleep apnea Adverse effects may also include minor sideeffects such as acne and oily skin as well as significant hair loss andor thinning of the hair which may be prevented with 5alpha reductase inhibitors ordinarily used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia such as finasteride Exogenous testosterone may also cause suppression of spermatogenesis leading to in some cases infertility It is recommended that physicians screen for prostate cancer with a digital rectal exam and prostatespecific antigen PSA level before starting therapy and monitor PSA and hematocrit levels closely during therapy

Some studies argue that ART increases the risk of prostate cancer although the results are not conclusive

As of September 2014 testosterone replacement therapy has been under review for appropriateness and safety by the Food and Drug Administration due to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes

In the United States usage increased from 05 in 2002 to 32 in 2013 and have since decreased to 17 in 2016

A UK study in 2013 showed that prescriptions for testosterone replacement particularly transdermal products almost doubled between 2000 and 2010

Testosterone is being investigated as therapy for the following conditions

The Marathon Rowing Championship is a continuous rowing regatta on the Cane River Lake in Natchitoches Louisiana Northwestern State University is the official host of the regatta The Marathon begins near the Melrose Plantation and ends at Front Street in Natchitoches The regatta is open to all sculling and sweepoar rowing boats On the day of the Marathon the Cane River is open only to competitors

The regatta is much longer than most head races but shorter than the Boston Rowing Marathon Normally the races with the longest distance that competitive crews enter are called head races for example the Head of the Charles and are usually around long The majority of crews do not even practice on bodies of water that allow them to row without stopping and turning around usually due to lake size or the presence of a river dam or lock

The Marathon Rowing Championship did not take place in 2010 or 2011 due to low water during an extreme regional drought

The record time for this event is 2 hours 31 minutes 20 seconds set in 2008 A more typical time it takes to complete the course is 3 to 4 hours

Pterodactyloidea
Pterodactyloidea derived from the Greek words  ptern for usual ptryx wing and  dctylos finger meaning winged finger wingfinger or fingerwing is one of the two traditional suborders of pterosaurs wing lizards and contains the most derived members of this group of flying reptiles They appeared during the middle Jurassic Period and differ from the basal though paraphyletic rhamphorhynchoids by their short tails and long wing metacarpals hand bones The most advanced forms also lack teeth and by the late Cretaceous all known pterodactyloids were toothless Many species had well developed crests on the skull a form of display taken to extremes in giantcrested forms like Nyctosaurus and Tupandactylus Pterodactyloids specifically the family Azhdarchidae were the last surviving pterosaurs when the order became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous Period together with the nonavian dinosaurs and most marine reptiles

Pterodactyl is also a common term for pterodactyloid pterosaurs though it can also be used to refer to Pterodactylus specifically or incorrectly to pterosaurs in general Wellknown examples of pterodactyloids include Pterodactylus Dsungaripterus Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus

In 2014 fossils from the Shishugou Formation of China were classified as the most basal pterodactyloid yet found Kryptodrakon At a minimum age of about 161 my it is about 5 million years older than the oldest previously known confirmed specimens Previously a fossil jaw recovered from the Middle Jurassic Stonesfield Slate formation in the United Kingdom was considered the oldest known This specimen supposedly represented a member of the family Ctenochasmatidae though further examination suggested it belonged to a teleosaurid stemcrocodilian instead of a pterosaur OSullivan and Martill 2018 described a partial synsacrum from the Stonesfield Slate identified as possibly pterodactyloid based on the number of incorporated sacrals although they commented that the morphology was perhaps closer to that of wukongopterids If correctly identified it would be the oldest pterodactyloid fossil known 

Pterodactyloidea is traditionally considered to be the group of shorttailed pterosaurs with long wrists metacarpus compared with the relatively long tails and short wrist bones of basal pterosaurs rhamphorhynchoids In 2004 Kevin Padian formally defined Pterodactyloidea as an apomorphybased clade containing those species possessing a metacarpal at least 80 of the length of the humerus homologous with that of Pterodactylus

A subgroup of pterodactyloids called the Lophocratia was named by David Unwin in 2003 Unwin defined the group as the most recent common ancestor of Pterodaustro guinazui and Quetzalcoatlus northropi and all its descendants This group was named for the presence of a head crest in most known species though this feature has since been found in more primitive pterosaurs and was probably an ancestral feature for all pterodactyloids

There are competing theories of pterodactyloid phylogeny Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich Martill and Andres 2018 This study found the two traditional groupings of ctenochasmatoids and kin as an early branching group with all other pterodactyloids grouped into the Eupterodactyloidea
Some studies based on a different type of analysis have found that this basic division into primitive archaeopterodactyloid and advanced eupterodactyloid species may not be correct Beginning in 2014 Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to ornithocheiroids or in some cases fall outside both groups The results of their updated 2017 analysis are shown below

14Butynediol
14Butynediol is an organic compound that is an alkyne and a diol It is a colourless hygroscopic solid that is soluble in water and polar organic solvents It is a commercially significant compound in its own right and as a precursor to other products

14Butynediol can be produced in the Reppe synthesis where formaldehyde and acetylene are the reactants

Several patented production methods use copper bismuth catalysts coated on an inert material The normal temperature range for the reaction is 90C up to 150C depending on the pressure used for the reaction which can range from 1 to 20 bar

14Butynediol is a precursor to 14butanediol and 2butene14diol by hydrogenation It is also used in the manufacture of certain herbicides textile additives corrosion inhibitors plasticizers synthetic resins and polyurethanes It is the major raw material used in the synthesis of vitamin B It is also used for brightening preserving and inhibiting nickel plating

It reacts with a mixture of chlorine and hydrochloric acid to give mucochloric acid HOCCClCClCHO see mucobromic acid

14Butynediol is corrosive and irritates the skin eyes and respiratory tract

Fernando Castro Pacheco
Fernando Castro Pacheco January 26 1918  August 8 2013 was a Mexican painter engraver illustrator printmaker and teacher As well as being known for traditional artistic forms Castro Pacheco illustrated several childrens books and produced works in sculpture He is more popularly known for his murals that invoke the spirit and history of the Mexican people His works evoke a unique use of color and form

Born in Mrida Yucatn in Mexico Castro Pacheco went on to become a well known international and local artist Little has been published about the artists early life While some scholars insist that he was a mostly selftaught artist Castro Pacheco began his formal training at the Mrida School of Fine Arts at the age of 15 While at the school he honed his artistic skills in engraving and painting During the time he spent at his school he studied under the instruction of Italian artist Alfonso Cardone It was at this school that he completed his first engravings in both wood and linoleum Castro Pacheco spent six years at the school and produced many works during this early period in his artistic career He also worked as an instructor and taught painting and drawing in the Mrida area

Upon completion of his studies Castro Pacheco is credited with cofounding La Escuela Libre de Las Artes Plsticas de Yucatn in 1941 He also served as an instructor for the school This school like many others founded during this period moved the art classroom and studio into an outdoor atmosphere allowing the artist to more freely capture the beauty color and realism of nature in art The idea of outdoor schools of art was promoted by Alfredo Ramos Martinz The idea centered on the promotion of more liberal methods for art instruction In 1942 soon after the founding of the school Castro Pacheco produced his first lithographs and displayed his painting and drawings in his first exhibit at the Galera de la Universidad de Yucatn

While in Mrida Castro Pacheco began work on several murals around the city Between 1941 and 1942 he completed murals in the preschools jardines de nios or playgrounds in Mrida as well as in several rural school buildings including the Escuela Campesina de Tocoh located in the rural henequenproducing area near Mrida He also completed al fresco murals with cultural and sport themes at the Biblioteca de la Union de Camioneros de Yucatn in Mrida

In 1943 Castro Pacheco moved to Mexico City where his career and personal life took new directions Castro Pacheco married during this time and fathered two children Relating to his career in art it was during his time in Mexico that he was first linked to the Taller de Grfica Popular The Taller was a group of artists and printmakers that formed in 1937 most likely from the dissolved Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios League of revolutionary writers and artists or LEAR which had been active in Mexico City prior to suffering from internal problems The Taller is associated with popular political movements in Mexico during this time that included progressive democratic ideas and support for union workers and people of the lower classes Castro Pachecos role at the Taller is debated According to some sources he was a somewhat important artist at the Taller producing engravings and prints that exemplified the face of the poor and suffering in Mexico According to other sources Castro Pachecos role at the Taller was brief and limited only participating in one show with the group upon his arrival in Mexico City It was through this first exhibit with the Taller however that Castro Pacheco gained attention as a print maker and artist A portfolio of his work was included at the exhibition which gained him attention in the Mexico City art scene and in the international scene as well

Castro Pacheco continued as a print maker until 1960 Working first with linoleum and then between 1945 and 1960 with predominantly wood cuts His work was used to illustrate books magazines and other publications Notable examples include La flauta de caa by Fernando Espejo and Los pozos sagrados by Miguel Alvarez Acosta He also illustrated the essay La llanura aislada by Elmer Llanes Marn

Before returning to Mrida in 1973 he also served at the director of the Escuela Nacional de Pintura y Escultura La Esmeralda

After his arrival and success in Mexico City Castro Pacheco exhibited his works on an international level In 1945 a selection of his paintings were exhibited the United States at a gallery in San Francisco California In 1947 his paintings were part of a collective exhibition in Havana Cuba

Upon his return to Mexico City in 1949 he was named a professor of the Escuela National de Artes Plsticas Castro Pacheco continued to produce works in various medium while in Mexico City Moving away from tradition canvas he is credited with producing the scenery for the ballet productions Guernica and La nube estril at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City in 1953 Remaining a prominent and active artist in 1963 Castro Pacheco earned a commission from the Institucin Nacional de Bellas Artes to travel to countries including Spain Italy France England the Netherlands and Belgium in order to study the artistic styles of these countries

After his travels abroad Castro Pacheco returned to his native Mrida in 1971 and continued to produce works Well established as an artist Castro Pachecos most well known works may be the murals that he completed between 1971 and 1979 for the states of Yucatn and Quertaro in Mexico Between 1971 and 1979 Castro Pacheco completed 27 murals for the governors palace in Mrida Yucatn These murals depict what some consider the realities of life in the Yucatn after the Spanish conquest as well as images and myths of native Maya tribes indigenous of the Yucatn region The murals depict scenes of work and torture that the native peoples of the Yucatn endured under Spanish control The reality of early henequen workers are seen in El henequen A traditional creation myth of the native tribes is also depicted by Castro Pacheco in his work Hombres de maiz The murals are oil paintings on large format canvas

The murals are on public display at the governors palace Unlike traditional murals that are pained directly onto the wall Castro Pachecos murals are unique transportable murals Because the murals were not produced and conceived on the walls in relation to the architecture his murals cannot be considered part of the traditional Mexican Renaissance of which muralist such as Diego Rivera and Jesus Guerrero Galvan are a part Because they are painted on large canvas and from a unique perspective the murals appear as large format paintings Castro Pacheco does not rely upon exaggerated foreshortening and perspectives in these works the images are merely of large proportion

To date Castro Pacheco remains a Mexican artist of note especially in Mrida where some of his most famous works are maintained In Mrida his works are well respected and on display in public areas Through his lifetime Castro Pacheco earned several awards for his artistic accomplishments In 1945 he earned his first award for his accomplishments in engraving in Mexico City In 1954 his painting Salon de invierno earned a first place award from the Saln de la Plstica Mexicana in Mexico City He went on to earn several other first place awards for his painting and engaging works from the Salon de Plstica Mexicana In 1964 he was awarded the Medalla Yucatn and in 1972 the Medalla Eligio Acorna from the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn and the Government of the State of the Yucatn In 1993 the Universidad Autnoma de Yucatn created a video to showcase the life work and talents of Castro Pacheco and in 1994 Castro Pacheco earned another honor when the Museo de Arte Contemporneo MACAYin Mrida named a gallery in his honor

Collections of his work remain on display at the Galera de Arte Mexicano in Mexico City and at the Museo MACAY in Mrida

To his credit Castro Pacheco has undertaken to produce works in various media His earliest works are known for their graphic style Sketches pencil drawings and inked works on paper account for a majority of his early works These works have in common Castro Pachecos attention to darkness Studies in shade and chiaroscuro are captured in this period of his career Using different shades of black and different degrees of darkness his dark expressionist pieces are seen in his work Despertar 1941

Early distempers oils and watercolors on the other hand created by Castro Pacheco use soft colors and pencil outlines to capture the beauty and fluidity of rural life in Mrida In his works from the period of the Escuela Libre the artist captures landscapes in a subtle way Drawing on the influences of the outdoor school images of livestock are displayed using warm brown tones in his 1941 work El corral de la hacienda Of his earliest works Castro Pachecos attention to watercolor techniques is also unique A large amount of his concentration on landscapes perspective and human form are seen in his watercolor snap shots of people performing everyday activities Examples include Pescadores 1941

As an artist Castro Pacheco has given his two dimensional works form and substance through his works in sculpture Mostly cast in bronze it is estimated that the artist produced at least eight original works in this medium He also produced about 35 enamels and 60 works in ceramic

One of the main subjects expressed in much of Castro Pachecos body of work is the female figure Both nudes and robed models are frequently at the center of this works Women that are the focal point of his work are of Mexican heritage While the image of a woman alone is depicted more frequently by Castro Pacheco he also depicts women with male companions or with children

Nathalia Crane
Nathalia Clara Ruth Crane 11 August 1913  22 October 1998 was a poet and novelist who became famous as a child prodigy after the publication of her first book of poetry The Janitors Boy written at age 10 and published two years later Her poetry was first published in The New York Sun when she was only 9 years old the paper unaware that she was a child She was elected into the British Society of Authors Playwrights and Composers in 1925 written up in The American Mercury and later became a professor of English at San Diego State University

After the publication of her second volume of poetry Lava Lane poet Edwin Markham implied that the publications were probably a hoax stating It seems impossible to me that a girl so immature could have written these poems They are beyond the powers of a girl of twelve The sophisticated viewpoint of sex knowledge of history and archeology found in these pages place them beyond the reach of any juvenile mind 

Crane was dubbed The Brooklyn Bard by the time she was 13 and became part of the Louis Untermeyer poetry circle during her late teens with Untermeyer contributing an introduction to her 1936 volume Swear by the Night  Other Poems He was an early promoter of her work stating some of the critics explained the work by insisting that the child was some sort of medium an instrument unaware of what was played upon it others considering the book a hoax scorned the fact that any child could have written verses so smooth in execution and so remarkable in spiritual overtones and that the appeal of such lines is not that they have been written by a child but by a poet

She is supposedly related to Stephen Crane author of The Red Badge of Courage and the wellknown publicist Dr Frank Crane

Texas State Highway Loop 150
Loop 150 is a loop route in the city of Bastrop in the US state of Texas Loop 150 follows the route of old alignment of SH 71 through Bastrop The route of SH 71 changed when the state built a bypass around Bastrop Loop 150 leaves SH 71 on the west side of town and rejoins SH 71 on the east side crossing the Colorado River The historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is part of Loop 150

The routing of the roadway had been proposed as early as 1919 as SH 3A In 1924 the historic Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop was completed to provide access to both sides of the Colorado River By 1926 the designation had been changed to SH 71 

In 2013 the Texas Legislature designated the new bridge on Loop 150 across the Colorado River as the Chief Petty Officer SOC Stephen Matt Mills Bridge Mills was a highly decorated United States Navy SEAL who died while conducting special operations in Afghanistan on August 6 2011

Loop 150 begins on the west side of Bastrop at a diamond interchange with SH 21 and SH 71 The loop heads northeast from the interchange to a crossing of the Colorado River After the river crossing the road heads east along Chestnut Street through Bastrop Loop 150 continues to the east through the city to an intersection with SH 21 and 95 SH 21 enters the intersection from the south concurrent with SH 95 and begins to run concurrently with Loop 150 as the two head to the east As the loop begins to curve back towards the southeast SH 21 leaves the concurrency to the northeast Access to nearby Bastrop State Park is provided by an intersection with Park Road 1 just east of the SH 21 intersection Loop 150 continues to the southeast to its endpoint at a concurrent SH 71 and SH 95

Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate
Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAADP is a Camobilizing second messenger synthesised in response to extracellular stimuli Like its mechanistic cousins IP and cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose Cyclic ADPribose NAADP binds to and opens Ca channels on intracellular organelles thereby increasing the intracellular Ca concentration which in turn modulates sundry cellular processes see Calcium signalling Structurally it is a dinucleotide that only differs from the housekeeping enzyme cofactor NADP by a hydroxyl group replacing the nicotinamide amino group and yet this minor modification converts it into the most potent Camobilizing second messenger yet described NAADP acts across phyla from plants to man

In their landmark 1987 paper Hon Cheung Lee and colleagues discovered not one but two Camobilizing second messengers cADPR and NAADP from the effects of nucleotides on Ca release in sea urchin egg homogenates It turns out that NAADP was a contaminant in commercial sources of NADP but it was not until 1995 that its structure was solved The first demonstration that NAADP could act in mammalian cells pancreas came four years later Subsequently NAADP has been detected in sources as diverse as human sperm red and white blood cells liver and pancreas to name but a few

The first demonstration that NAADP levels increase in response to an extracellular stimulus arose from studying sea urchin fertilization NAADP changed in both the eggs and sperm upon contact Subsequently other cell types have followed suit as exemplified by the pancreas acinar and beta cells Tcells and smooth muscle Levels increase very rapidly  and possibly precede the increase in the other messengers IP and cADPR but can be very transient spiking and returning to basal levels within seconds The transduction mechanisms that couple cell stimuli to such NAADP increases are illdefined with some suggestions of cyclic AMP or cytosolic Ca itself stimulating synthesis

Regardless of the details an outstanding issue is that the physiological route of NAADP synthesis has still not been unequivocally identified  neither the reactions nor the enzymes Clearly it is theoretically possible there may be multiple routes of synthesis but this would be unprecedented in the second messenger world To date the most favoured hypothesis is the socalled baseexchange reaction nicotinic acid  NADP  NAADP  nicotinamide catalyzed by ADPribosyl cyclases which are a family of enzymes that include CD38 and CD157 in mammals and orthologs in sea urchin and Aplysia ovotestis These were first discovered as the synthetic enzymes for cADPR but later revealed to be multifunctional promiscuous enzymes that can also produce NAADP Certainly NAADP production can occur in vitro but whether it occurs in vivo is another question because genetic knockout or knockdown of ADPribosyl cyclases has no effect on NAADP production in some cell types and there may be other routes which require different substrates and enzymes

The first chemical synthesis of NAADP was achieved in 2004 using a chemoenzymatic approach a total chemical synthesis of NADP and then conversion of this to NAADP enzymatically

Like any second messenger system the signal must be terminated and there must be routes for NAADP removal but again little is known with any degree of certainty A 23phosphatase stimulated by Ca has been proposed in brain and possibly in pancreatic acinar cells that catabolises NAADP to inactive NAAD More recently CD38 has also been proposed to breakdown NAADP to ADPRP  see inset NAADP may also be reduced to NAADPH

Hardly surprisingly the three major second messengers do not do the same thing and cannot always substitute for each other The physiological consequences of Ca release by each messenger may be different ie NAADP couples to downstream responses that cannot be mimicked by IP3 and cADPR For example NAADP selectively stimulates neuronal differentiation or exocytosis in immune cells

In contrast to IP3 and cyclic ADPribose which predominantly mobilize Ca from the neutral and abundant endoplasmic reticulum ER store NAADP selectively targets acidic Ca stores  usually less abundant than the ER but with a pivotal role that belies their size This paradigm shift away from the ER derives from seminal studies again in sea urchin egg that showed NAADPmediated Ca release was sensitive to agents that target acidic organelles eg bafilomycin A1 but was less sensitive to ones that interfere with ER Ca storage eg thapsigargin

This is a blanket term that encompasses a spectrum of acidic vesicles that include endosomes lysosomes and lysosomerelated organelles and secretory vesicles and acidocalcisomes They are a highly dynamic continuum of vesicles with a rich variety of established biochemical roles in cells to which Ca storage can now be added Their luminal pH is one characteristic that distinguishes a given vesicle class from another where endosomes are weakly acidic pH 665 lysosomes are typically the most acidic pH 4550 and secretory vesicles are typically pH 55 Ca is seen to be increasingly important for endolysosomal function eg trafficking and autophagy Aberrations in Ca signals can have pathophysiological consequences including lysosomal storage diseases such as Niemann Pick C and Mucolipidosis IV

When NAADP mobilizes Ca from these stores the pH of the stores concomitantly increases becomes more alkaline as testified by studies in sea urchin egg mammalian heart and pancreas Whether this has consequences for vesicle or NAADP function remains to be seen but luminal pH is usually crucial for resident protein activity

In other Castoring organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi stores are filled by calcium ATPase pumps typified by the ubiquitous members of the SERCA or the SPCA secretory pathway CaATPase families respectively Ca uptake by acidic stores occurs via other proteins in yeast and plants the best understood systems the acidic vacuoles host two uptake pathways a high affinity CaATPase and a low affinity CaH antiporter or exchanger generically denoted as CHX The pumps are different from the SERCA family and importantly are insensitive to their inhibitor thapsigargin whereas the exchanger exploit the H gradient to drive Ca uptake against its concentration gradient The genes encoding these proteins are welldefined

In higher organisms the situation is less clear Ca uptake usually occurs via a thapsigargininsensitive pathway therefore precluding SERCA involvement and appears to be dependent upon the H gradient whether this occurs via a single unknown CHX or via exchangers in series eg NaH exchanger coupled to a NaCa exchanger is unproven Acidic vesicles in some cell types may well take a leaf out of the yeastsplants book and host two uptake pathways but whether this is a widespread template is unclear

In the absence of selective Ca uptake inhibitors often because we do not even know the proteinroute it is common to indirectly inhibit Ca uptake by collapsing the thermodynamic drive the H gradient The H gradient can be eliminated either with H ionophores protonophores such as nigericin or monensin or by inhibiting the VATPase that generates the H gradient with compounds such as bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin

Even from the early pioneering work in sea urchin egg it was clear from the pharmacological profile that NAADP acted upon a different channel from the IP3 receptor and ryanodine receptor and this has recently been borne out by the molecular identification of the NAADP receptor as members of the TPC twopore channel family As structural intermediates between single domain TRP and fourdomain Voltagedependent calcium channel the TPCs form oligomers possibly dimers to form the functional Ca channel Appropriately these channels reside on acidic organelles including different classes of endosomes and lysosomes likely due to the presence of endolysomal targeting sequences

The effect of genetic manipulation of TPC levels ie overexpression knockdown or knockout is consistent with TPCs being the NAADPgated channel Moreover TPCs recapitulate many of the characteristics of NAADPinduced Ca release ie they promote Ca release from acidic stores correlate with NAADPbinding sites exhibit a bellshaped NAADP concentrationresponse curve sensitivity to the NAADP antagonist Ned19 and provide trigger Ca that is subsequently amplified by ER Ca channels

There are 3 genes that encode three isoforms of TPC13 that differ substantially from each other in their primary sequence but these differences are preserved across species such that human and sea urchin TPC1 are more closely related than are human TPC1 and human TPC2 Moreover the TPC isoforms exhibit different organellar distributions with TPC1 being found throughout the endolysosomal system whereas TPC2 shows a more restricted lateendosomallysosomal localization

In spite of a burgeoning literature supporting TPCs as the NAADPregulated channel this was challenged in 201213 by reports that TPCs are instead Na channels regulated by the endolysosomal lipid Phosphatidylinositol 35bisphosphate PI35P and also by metabolic state via ATP and mTOR

As a result of this several groups reinvestigated the permeability properties of TPCs and their role in NAADPinduced Ca release They agreed that TPCs are indeed permeable to Na but they could not necessarily recapitulate the Na selectivity shown in the 201213 studies These groups therefore concluded that TPCs were cation channels that conducted both Ca and Na analogous to the NMDA receptor of the plasma membrane

As for activation by ligands all groups agree that TPCs are modulated by PI35P though its role is considered by some to be more of a permissive factor rather than an acute signal per se As for NAADP itself the conclusion in 2012 that TPCs are not involved in NAADP signalling was partly due to the fact that their transgenic mice designed to knockout both TPC1 and TPC2 doubleknockout DKO apparently retained sensitivity to NAADP However others have questioned whether these mice are true DKO when they are predicted to retain 90 of the TPC protein sequences ie they express only mildly truncated TPCs which are functional  In a different DKO mouse that is demonstrably TPCnull NAADP responses are completely abolished

On balance the controversy has been somewhat resolved and it is clear that TPCs are absolutely essential for NAADP The permeability properties are more equivocal why some groups observe a Na selectivity while others see a mixed NaCa permeability is currently unclear The necessarily artificial experimental conditions for such as a demanding technique as singlelysosome patch clamp makes it harder to be dogmatic about which ions permeate under native physiological conditions It is likely and the simpler model that TPCs function as NAADPgated Capermeable channels but it cannot be formally excluded that TPCs acting as Na channels play a permissive role in a more complex ionic circuit that supports NAADPinduced Ca release 

Crystal structures of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana reveal the dimeric nature of the molecule but thus far do not explain the cation selectivity mechanism

IP3 binds directly to its cognate IP3 receptor which is therefore a true ligandgated ion channel In contrast NAADP may not bind directly to TPCs but may require an intermediate unknown accessory protein In sea urchin egg homogenate the binding proteins may be smaller than TPCs themselves judging by photoaffinity labelling with PazidoNAADP Therefore the NAADP receptor is likely to be a multiprotein complex on acidic vesicles

In addition to NAADP gating the channel there is evidence that the luminal pH also affects TPC channel activity either TPC1 or TPC2  However a clear consensus on the effect of pH has not been reached with some suggesting that acidic pH favours TPC1 or TPC2 opening whereas others report that a more alkaline pH favours TPC2 opening

Furthermore luminal Ca also promotes TPC1 and TPC2 opening in the latter case luminal Ca also sensitizes TPCs to NAADP analogous to luminal Ca regulation of IP3Rs and RyRs but this demands wider study across isoforms and species This is one way by which crosstalk can occur between acidic Ca stores and the ER ie Ca release from the ER can prime acidic Ca stores and promote further NAADPdependent Ca responses 

To date the majority of evidence is against the NAADP receptor being regulated by either cytosolic Ca or pH

Recently a selective cellpermeant NAADP antagonist transNed19 has been discovered which blocks Ca signals and downstream Cadependent processes such as differentiation Prior to that only high concentrations of blockers of Ltype Ca channels eg diltiazem dihydropyridines could be used with obvious concerns over nonNAADP effects

Although not true antagonism the NAADP receptor can selfinactivate when bound to nonreleasing concentrations of NAADP itself Such inactivating prepulses of NAADP were the first strategy for implicating NAADP in subsequent physiological pathways

NAADP is charged and cannot cross cell membranes Therefore an inactive lipophilic ester precursor NAADPAM has been synthesised which crosses membranes and rapidly regenerates NAADP in the cytosol following the action of endogenous esterases

Caged NAADP is an inactive membraneimpermeant analog of NAADP that can be introduced into cells by microinjection or a patch pipette Flash photolysis with a UV light source rapidly converts this into NAADP allowing the experimenter to precisely manipulate NAADP levels in time and space

An indirect means of inhibiting NAADP action is to deplete its target Ca stores As noted above this usually entails collapsing the H gradient with either VATPase inhibitors eg Bafilomycin A1 or protonophores eg nigericin or monensin In platelets it has been suggested that SERCA3 inhibition with tBHQ can also abrogate NAADPdependent signals

The two paralogous enzymes transmembrane CD38 and GPI anchored CD157 that produce NAADP and cADPR in humans both have their active synthesis site in the ectodomain Though this may involve vesicular synthesis but it has been shown that it is produced at the extracellular sites and also can act when produced by a different cell or added artificially from outside So the NAADP has to enter the cell either by diffusion or by transport Considering the fact that the substrate of NAADP synthesis NADP itself is very sparse in the extracellular medium a purse diffusion based mechanism has been suspected to be less likely than a transporter mediated path This is compatible with recent data which indicate a carrier mediated transport partially blockable by dipyridamole and cold temperature

Pleasant Plains New Jersey
Pleasant Plains is an unincorporated community and censusdesignated place CDP located in Franklin Township in Somerset County New Jersey United States As of the 2010 United States Census the CDPs population was 922 Having no distinct boundaries a large area in the center of Franklin Township centered on the intersections of South Middlebush Road County Route 615 with Claremont and Suydam Roads the former also CR 648 is generally considered Pleasant Plains

Prior to the development of K Hovnanians Town and Country Estates in 1998 the area included little more than a collection of 18th and 19th century farms and rural lanes Its historic rural character may be seen in an estimate from 1882 which listed the Pleasant Plains population at 46

An icon in the area has been the early 19th century general store and blacksmith shop buildings known since the late 1800s as Lairds Brothers Hardware and Lairds Corner Store

Another area feature is the Pleasant Plains Cemetery on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner that has been in use from early settlement of the area until the present day

Since the early 19th century and possibly even earlier the area featured a oneroom schoolhouse known as the Pleasant Plains School Located on the north side of Suydam Road about a half mile west of Lairds Corner it remained in use until about 1931 when the Township started decommissioning its oneroom schoolhouses in favor of larger regional schools Moved across the road on log rollers it was converted into a residence and used until the late 20th century when it was threatened with demolition to make way for the Town and County development Instead it was moved to the Townships Municipal Complex on DeMott Lane where it awaits further rehabilitation

The Six Mile Run Historic District listed on the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places includes a number of properties in the Pleasant Plains area

According to the United States Census Bureau Pleasant Plains had a total area of 3221 square miles 8342km including 3215 square miles 8328km of land and 0006 square miles 0014km of water 017

The Pleasant Plains Cemetery located on South Middlebush Road just south of Lairds Corner was established in 1898

Peristimulus time histogram
In neurophysiology peristimulus time histogram and poststimulus time histogram both abbreviated PSTH or PST histogram are histograms of the times at which neurons fire It is also sometimes called pre event time histogram or PETH These histograms are used to visualize the rate and timing of neuronal spike discharges in relation to an external stimulus or event The peristimulus time histogram is sometimes called perievent time histogram and poststimulus and peristimulus are often hyphenated

The prefix peri for through is typically used in the case of periodic stimuli in which case the PSTH show neuron firing times wrapped to one cycle of the stimulus The prefix post is used when the PSTH shows the timing of neuron firings in response to a stimulus event or onset

To make a PSTH a spike train recorded from a single neuron is aligned with the onset or a fixed phase point of an identical stimulus repeatedly presented to an animal The aligned sequences are superimposed in time and then used to construct a histogram


The optimal bin size assuming an underlying Poisson point process  is a minimizer of the formula 2kv

The district heavily favored conservative Democratic candidates with only three Republicans taking the district The district shifted Republican most notably in electing Tom Coburn who vacated the seat due to a selfimposed term limit pledge He was elected to the United States Senate 4 years later It has since been held by Brad Carson and Dan Boren In 20122018 the 2nd elected a Republican to the House the current Representative Markwayne Mullin

The districts Democratic leanings stem partly from historic migration patterns into the state The Little Dixie region of the district imported the people and culture of southern states such as Mississippi after Reconstruction Voter registration in Little Dixie runs as high as 90 percent Democratic Additionally Native Americans in the region tend to vote for Democratic candidates and they have helped Democratic candidates win statewide elections

Historically this is where Democratic presidential candidates perform best in the state Bill Clinton easily carried the district in 1992 and 1996 However the district has been swept up in the growing Republican trend in Oklahoma George W Bush received 59 percent of the vote in this district in 2004 John McCain received 66 percent of the vote in this district in 2008

Muskogee has produced six representatives more than any other city in the district Tahlequah has produced three representatives the second most of any city in the district

Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
The Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop is a long bridge with three steel truss spans and concrete piers that crosses the Colorado River as part of Loop 150 through Bastrop Texas The three bridge spans over the river consist of identical Parker through trusses each in length supported on concrete piers The bridge is one of the earliest surviving uses of the Parker truss in Texas

The Colorado River Bridge was the second bridge crossing at this location The first bridge at the crossing was built from 1889 to 1890 at a cost of 45000 This bridge replaced the ferries across the river which had been in use since the 1830s The bridge was in length It was originally a toll bridge but was later purchased by the county and the tolls were removed

With automobiles becoming the dominant form of transportation in the United States after World War I a new bridge was needed to handle the increasing traffic between Houston and Austin The original estimate of the cost of the Colorado River Bridge was 40000 and was partially financed by bonds issued by Bastrop County The rest was paid for with federal funds disbursed by the Texas State Highway Department Bids on the project were solicited and the Kansas City Bridge Co was selected as contractor The final cost of the bridges construction was 167500 The bridge was completed in 1923 and opened for use in January 1924 The original bridge was sold and torn down in the early 1930s

Ownership of the Colorado River Bridge probably passed from the county to the state during the Great Depression as the local governments did not have the funds to maintain their road systems

Growth in Bastrop in the 1990s strained the capacity of the narrow twolane bridge A wider concrete beam bridge was built parallel to the Colorado River Bridge The State of Texas transferred ownership of the truss bridge to the City of Bastrop and the bridge became a pedestrian walkway The bridge is also used for special events such as the annual Art on the Bridge art show and sale The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 19 1990

Library damage resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake
Library damage resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been reported in six Asian countries On December 26 the massive 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake struck off the northwest coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra The resulting tsunamis killed more than 180000 people In addition to the loss of human lives cultural institutions were destroyed in several Asian nations Libraries on the Eastern coast of Sri Lanka and the northern province of Aceh on Sumatra were most severely affected by the disaster

Damage to libraries in India has not been well documented Water damage was reported at Madras University Library in Chennai The Asian Development Bank reports extensive damage to schools in the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu A government assessment found that 252 schools in Tamil Nadu need complete reconstruction 19 need major repairs and 49 need minor repairs

In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands 78 teachers are listed as killed or missing Further 25 percent of primary schools 33 percent of upper primary schools and 31 percent of senior secondary schools were seriously damaged indicating that school libraries in the region also suffered damage

The Sumatran province of Aceh was severely damaged by the earthquake and resulting tsunami An estimated 167736 Indonesians were killed and 25 of Achenese lost their source of livelihood Banda Aceh Acehs capital was the closest major city to the earthquakes epicenter and many of its major libraries suffered extensive damage

The Aceh Provincial Library BPD was inundated with three meters of water Twenty three staff members were killed including the librarys director Bachtiar Azis who is listed as missing along with his family In addition to loss of life the BPD suffered physical damage and a near total loss of its collection Concrete and steel fences surrounding the twostory building were mostly destroyed however the building itself remained standing All library materials housed on the first floor were swept away by the waves and the floor was covered in 30cmthick mud These lost materials comprise most of its childrens young adult and adult collections The water did not reach the second floor but looting resulted in the loss of most materials and equipment A collection of books received under legal deposit and housed on the second floor was left undisturbed and survived the disaster and looting intact Despite these losses the BPD reopened to the public in May 2005 As of August 2005 repairs were still being made to the building the library lacked computers for its warintek information technology section and most areas of the library needed furnishing and collection replacement

Of Acehs eight public libraries two were completely destroyed These libraries were located in the hardhit cities of Meulaboh and Sigli

Mobile library units or perpustakaan keliling are used to serve rural areas of Aceh Days before the earthquake and tsunami the BPD had received two newly built mobile library units from the National Library of Indonesia Both of these were destroyed along with the rest of the mobile libraries parked on the BPDs carport In July 2005 the National Library donated two replacement mobile units however the new BPD director noted that further units were needed to adequately serve outlying regions of the province

The Aceh Documentation and Information Center known for its collection of rare books and manuscripts chronicling the heritage of Aceh was completely destroyed Only half of the building remained standing and the entire collection was swept away A team from the National Library of Indonesia visiting in January 2005 was able to salvage only three books and one sheet of the genealogy of the Muslim kings of Aceh These were taken to Jakarta for restoration

The Provincial Archives Agency lost 80 percent of the photographs in its collection The Secretariat Office of the Aceh Province lost 160 boxes of records

The Aceh branch of the National Land Register Agency was inundated with water Roughly 629 boxes of materials certifying individual land ownership in the province were damaged Due to the efforts of a team of conservators from Japan and archivists from the National Archives in Jakarta many of these land register documents were preserved

Damage to school libraries has not been well documented The Indonesia National Library reports that SMA 1 a high school in Banda Aceh was not damaged by flood waters as it is located on the second floor however did experience some earthquake damage Overall 2364 teachers and staff members were killed and 2240 schools were destroyed on Sumatra and its outlying islands

The Central Library at the ArRaniri Institute for Islamic Studies a public Islamic University in Banda Aceh lost its information servers due to theft and seawater damage

Baiturrahman Grand Mosque Library in Banda Aceh lost its entire collection Due to the mosques central location and importance to the community a concerted effort was made to clear and repair this complex of buildings immediately after the tsunami As of August 2005 the library had reopened with 1200 books in its collection
The library of the Agricultural Information Institute of Banda Aceh was inundated with water from the tsunami but its physical structure remained intact

The Library and Museum of the Ali Hasymy Educational Foundation survived intact as the tsunami did not reach this area of Banda Aceh

According to a Malaysian professor of library science damage to libraries was minimal in Malaysia

All of the 199 inhabited islands comprising the Maldives atolls were affected by the tsunami The Maldives Library Association was not able to survey all public libraries across the atoll however a representative indicated some libraries were completely destroyed

Fortysix percent of schools in the Maldives were damaged and nine schools were completely destroyed

Damage to libraries in Thailand has not been well documented The Ministry of Education has reported that five schools were completely destroyed and 51 schools were damaged

More than 35000 Sri Lankans were killed and 516000 people were displaced as a result of the tsunami Roughly 60 percent of the coastal area of Sri Lanka was severely affected by the tsunami Libraries across the country were damaged and it is estimated that 12 million volumes of books and other reading materials were destroyed in the disaster Out of the 950 public libraries in Sri Lanka 55 libraries were affected and 28 were completely destroyed Several libraries were used as refuge centres or hospitals in the aftermath of the tsunami and surviving furniture and collections suffered as a result

One estimate of damage to school libraries in Sri Lanka indicates that of the 9790 schools in the country 182 schools were directly affected by the tsunami and an additional 282 schools were damaged because of their use as refugee camps after the tsunami While not all of these schools had a fullfledged library most had a book closet or other collection of materials At least 165 school libraries were damaged by the tsunami Compounding the damage many schools had large collection of textbooks on hand for distribution to students at the beginning of the school year in January Damage reports range from furniture damage to lost collections to complete destruction of the physical building

Sri Lankan government departments lost public records to the tsunami In the Southern province all electoral registers were destroyed along with 600000 land deeds from the Department of the Surveyor General

Sixtyeight libraries affiliated with religious institutions and at least three museums were damaged by the tsunami Many of these libraries were attached to Buddhist temples and contained valuable collections of palm leaf manuscripts and documents relating to Ayurveda the Indian medical tradition adopted in ancient Sri Lanka

The National Maritime Museum in Galle lost 90 percent of its collection mostly artifacts salvaged from underwater wrecks and archaeology sites The museum also lost all of its computers and other technical equipment The collection housed in the Martin Wickramasinghe Folk Museum of Koggala survived relatively unscathed however the childrens library attached to the museum was severely damaged along with most of the museums furniture The Maritime Archaeology Unit of the Central Cultural Fund was also severely damaged resulting in the loss of artifacts from an 18thcentury Dutch shipwreck that were eventually to be donated to a museum

In the weeks following the disaster the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions cooperated with UNESCO the Sri Lanka Library Association the National Library and Documentation Center of Sri Lanka and other organizations to create the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Committee for Libraries Information Services and Archives SL DMCLISA The committee worked to secure funding for temporary libraries and computer equipment and began reviewing architectural plans for rebuilding libraries Further initiatives were developed to encourage twinning or pairing of Sri Lankan libraries with donors

In addition to working with the disaster committee the Sri Lanka Library Association targeted five libraries for rebuilding with the intent of creating model institutions As of 2006 three of these libraries had reopened while progress on the other two was delayed due to political instability in the region

Oncogenomics
Oncogenomics is a subfield of genomics that characterizes cancerassociated genes It focuses on genomic epigenomic and transcript alterations in cancer

Cancer is a genetic disease caused by accumulation of DNA mutations and epigenetic alterations leading to unrestrained cell proliferation and neoplasm formation The goal of oncogenomics is to identify new oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes that may provide new insights into cancer diagnosis predicting clinical outcome of cancers and new targets for cancer therapies The success of targeted cancer therapies such as Gleevec Herceptin and Avastin raised the hope for oncogenomics to elucidate new targets for cancer treatment
Besides understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms that initiate or drive cancer progression oncogenomics targets personalized cancer treatment Cancer develops due to DNA mutations and epigenetic alterations that accumulate randomly Identifying and targeting the mutations in an individual patient may lead to increased treatment efficacy

The completion of the Human Genome Project facilitated the field of oncogenomics and increased the abilities of researchers to find oncogenes Sequencing technologies and global methylation profiling techniques have been applied to the study of oncogenomics

The genomics era began in the 1990s with the generation of DNA sequences of many organisms In the 21st century the completion of the Human Genome Project enabled the study of functional genomics and examining tumor genomes Cancer is a main focus

The epigenomics era largely began more recently about 2000 One major source of epigenetic change is altered methylation of CpG islands at the promoter region of genes see DNA methylation in cancer A number of recently devised methods can assess the DNA methylation status in cancers versus normal tissues Some methods assess methylation of CpGs located in different classes of loci including CpG islands shores and shelves as well as promoters gene bodies and intergenic regions Cancer is also a major focus of epigenetic studies

Access to whole cancer genome sequencing is important to cancer or cancer genome research because

Access to methylation profiling is important to cancer research because

The first cancer genome was sequenced in 2008 This study sequenced a typical acute myeloid leukaemia AML genome and its normal counterpart genome obtained from the same patient The comparison revealed ten mutated genes Two were already thought to contribute to tumor progression an internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase gene which activates kinase signaling and is associated with a poor prognosis and a four base insertion in exon 12 of the NPM1 gene NPMc These mutations are found in 2530 of AML tumors and are thought to contribute to disease progression rather than to cause it directly

The remaining 8 were new mutations and all were single base changes Four were in families that are strongly associated with cancer pathogenesis PTPRT CDH24 PCLKC and SLC15A1 The other four had no previous association with cancer pathogenesis They did have potential functions in metabolic pathways that suggested mechanisms by which they could act to promote cancer KNDC1 GPR124 EB12 GRINC1B

These genes are involved in pathways known to contribute to cancer pathogenesis but before this study most would not have been candidates for targeted gene therapy This analysis validated the approach of whole cancer genome sequencing in identifying somatic mutations and the importance of parallel sequencing of normal and tumor cell genomes

In 2011 the genome of an exceptional bladder cancer patient whose tumor had been eliminated by the drug everolimus was sequenced revealing mutations in two genes TSC1 and NF2 The mutations disregulated mTOR the protein inhibited by everolimus allowing it to reproduce without limit As a result in 2015 the Exceptional Responders Initiative was created at the National Cancer Institute The initiative allows such exceptional patients who have responded positively for at least six months to a cancer drug that usually fails to have their genomes sequenced to identify the relevant mutations Once identified other patients could be screened for those mutations and then be given the drug In 2016 To that end a nationwide cancer drug trial began in 2015 involving up to twentyfour hundred centers Patients with appropriate mutations are matched with one of more than forty drugs

In 2014 the Center for Molecular Oncology rolled out the MSKIMPACT test a screening tool that looks for mutations in 341 cancerassociated genes By 2015 more than five thousand patients had been screened Patients with appropriate mutations are eligible to enroll in clinical trials that provide targeted therapy

Genomics technologies include



Bioinformatics technologies allow the statistical analysis of genomic data The functional characteristics of oncogenes has yet to be established Potential functions include their transformational capabilities relating to tumour formation and specific roles at each stage of cancer development

After the detection of somatic cancer mutations across a cohort of cancer samples bioinformatic computational analyses can be carried out to identify likely functional and likely driver mutations There are three main approaches routinely used for this identification mapping mutations assessing the effect of mutation of the function of a protein or a regulatory element and finding signs of positive selection across a cohort of tumors The approaches are not necessarily sequential however there are important relationships of precedence between elements from the different approaches Different tools are used at each step

Operomics aims to integrate genomics transcriptomics and proteomics to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the cancer development

Comparative oncogenomics uses crossspecies comparisons to identify oncogenes This research involves studying cancer genomes transcriptomes and proteomes in model organisms such as mice identifying potential oncogenes and referring back to human cancer samples to see whether homologues of these oncogenes are important in causing human cancers Genetic alterations in mouse models are similar to those found in human cancers These models are generated by methods including retroviral insertion mutagenesis or graft transplantation of cancerous cells

Mutations provide the raw material for natural selection in evolution and can be caused by errors of DNA replication the action of exogenous mutagens or endogenous DNA damage The machinery of replication and genome maintenance can be damaged by mutations or altered by physiological conditions and differential levels of expression in cancer see references in 

As pointed out by Gao et al the stability and integrity of the human genome are maintained by the DNAdamage response DDR system Unrepaired DNA damage is a major cause of mutations that drive carcinogenesis If DNA repair is deficient DNA damage tends to accumulate Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to errorprone translesion synthesis Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer DDR genes are often repressed in human cancer by epigenetic mechanisms Such repression may involve DNA methylation of promoter regions or repression of DDR genes by a microRNA Epigenetic repression of DDR genes occurs more frequently than gene mutation in many types of cancer see Cancer epigenetics Thus epigenetic repression often plays a more important role than mutation in reducing expression of DDR genes This reduced expression of DDR genes is likely an important driver of carcinogenesis

Nucleotide sequence context influences mutation probability and analysis of mutational mutable DNA motifs can be essential for understanding the mechanisms of mutagenesis in cancer Such motifs represent the fingerprints of interactions between DNA and mutagens between DNA and repairreplicationmodification enzymes Examples of motifs are the AID motif WRCYRGYW WA or T Rpurine and Ypyrimidine with C to TGA mutations and errorprone DNA pol  attributed AIDrelated mutations A to GCG in WATW motifs

Another agnostic way to analyze the observed mutational spectra and DNA sequence context of mutations in tumors involves pooling all mutations of different types and contexts from cancer samples into a discrete distribution If multiple cancer samples are available their contextdependent mutations can be represented in the form of a nonnegative matrix This matrix can be further decomposed into components mutational signatures which ideally should describe individual mutagenic factors Several computational methods have been proposed for solving this decomposition problem The first implementation of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization NMF method is available in Sanger Institute Mutational Signature Framework in the form of a MATLAB package On the other hand if mutations from a single tumor sample are only available the DeconstructSigs R package and MutaGene server may provide the identification of contributions of different mutational signatures for a single tumor sample In addition MutaGene server provides mutagen or cancerspecific mutational background models and signatures that can be applied to calculate expected DNA and protein site mutability to decouple relative contributions of mutagenesis and selection in carcinogenesis

Synthetic lethality arises when a combination of deficiencies in the expression of two or more genes leads to cell death whereas a deficiency in only one of these genes does not The deficiencies can arise through mutations epigenetic alterations or inhibitors of one of the genes

The therapeutic potential of synthetic lethality as an efficacious anticancer strategy is continually improving Recently the applicability of synthetic lethality to targeted cancer therapy has heightened due to the recent work of scientists including Ronald A DePinho and colleagues in what is termed collateral lethality Muller et al found that passenger genes with chromosomal proximity to tumor suppressor genes are collaterally deleted in some cancers Thus the identification of collaterally deleted redundant genes carrying out an essential cellular function may be the untapped reservoir for then pursuing a synthetic lethality approach Collateral lethality therefore holds great potential in identification of novel and selective therapeutic targets in oncology In 2012 Muller et al identified that homozygous deletion of redundantessential glycolytic ENO1 gene in human glioblastoma GBM is the consequence of proximity to 1p36 tumor suppressor locus deletions and may hold potential for a synthetic lethality approach to GBM inhibition ENO1 is one of three homologous genes ENO2 ENO3 that encodes the mammalian alphaenolase enzyme ENO2 which encodes enolase 2 is mostly expressed in neural tissues leading to the postulation that in ENO1deleted GBM ENO2 may be the ideal target as the redundant homologue of ENO1 Muller found that both genetic and pharmacological ENO2 inhibition in GBM cells with homozygous ENO1 deletion elicits a synthetic lethality outcome by selective killing of GBM cells In 2016 Muller and colleagues discovered antibiotic SF2312 as a highly potent nanomolarrange enolase inhibitor which preferentially inhibits glioma cell proliferation and glycolytic flux in ENO1deleted cells SF2312 was shown to be more efficacious than panenolase inhibitor PhAH and have more specificity for ENO2 inhibition over ENO1 Subsequent work by the same team showed that the same approach could be applied to pancreatic cancer whereby homozygously deleted SMAD4 results in the collateral deletion of mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 ME2 an oxidative decarboxylase essential for redox homeostasis Dey et al show that ME2 genomic deletion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells results in high endogenous reactive oxygen species consistent with KRASdriven pancreatic cancer and essentially primes ME2null cells for synthetic lethality by depletion of redundant NADPdependent isoform ME3 The effects of ME3 depletion were found to be mediated by inhibition of de novo nucleotide synthesis resulting from AMPK activation and mitochondrial ROSmediated apoptosis Meanwhile Oike et al demonstrated the generalizability of the concept by targeting redundant essentialgenes in process other than metabolism namely the SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 subunits in the chromatinremodeling SWISNF complex

Some oncogenes are essential for survival of all cells not only cancer cells Thus drugs that knock out these oncogenes and thereby kill cancer cells may also damage normal cells inducing significant illness However other genes may be essential to cancer cells but not to healthy cells

Treatments based on the principle of synthetic lethality have prolonged the survival of cancer patients and show promise for future advances in reversal of carcinogenesis A major type of synthetic lethality operates on the DNA repair defect that often initiates a cancer and is still present in the tumor cells Some examples are given here

BRCA1 or BRCA2 expression is deficient in a majority of highgrade breast and ovarian cancers usually due to epigenetic methylation of its promoter or epigenetic repression by an overexpressed microRNA see articles BRCA1 and BRCA2 BRCA1 and BRCA2 are important components of the major pathway for homologous recombinational repair of doublestrand breaks If one or the other is deficient it increases the risk of cancer especially breast or ovarian cancer A backup DNA repair pathway for some of the damages usually repaired by BRCA1 and BRCA2 depends on PARP1 Thus many ovarian cancers respond to an FDAapproved treatment with a PARP inhibitor causing synthetic lethality to cancer cells deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2 This treatment is also being evaluated for breast cancer and numerous other cancers in Phase III clinical trials in 2016

There are two pathways for homologous recombinational repair of doublestrand breaks The major pathway depends on BRCA1 PALB2 and BRCA2 while an alternative pathway depends on RAD52 Preclinical studies involving epigenetically reduced or mutated BRCAdeficient cells in culture or injected into mice show that inhibition of RAD52 is synthetically lethal with BRCAdeficiency

Mutations in genes employed in DNA mismatch repair MMR cause a high mutation rate In tumors such frequent subsequent mutations often generate nonself immunogenic antigens A human Phase II clinical trial with 41 patients evaluated one synthetic lethal approach for tumors with or without MMR defects The product of gene PD1 ordinarily represses cytotoxic immune responses Inhibition of this gene allows a greater immune response When cancer patients with a defect in MMR in their tumors were exposed to an inhibitor of PD1 67  78 of patients experienced immunerelated progressionfree survival In contrast for patients without defective MMR addition of PD1 inhibitor generated only 11 of patients with immunerelated progressionfree survival Thus inhibition of PD1 is primarily synthetically lethal with MMR defects

ARID1A a chromatin modifier is required for nonhomologous end joining a major pathway that repairs doublestrand breaks in DNA and also has transcription regulatory roles ARID1A mutations are one of the 12 most common carcinogenic mutations Mutation or epigenetically decreased expression of ARID1A has been found in 17 types of cancer Preclinical studies in cells and in mice show that synthetic lethality for ARID1A deficiency occurs by either inhibition of the methyltransferase activity of EZH2 or with addition of the kinase inhibitor dasatinib

Another approach is to individually knock out each gene in a genome and observe the effect on normal and cancerous cells If the knockout of an otherwise nonessential gene has little or no effect on healthy cells but is lethal to cancerous cells containing a mutated oncogene then the systemwide suppression of the suppressed gene can destroy cancerous cells while leaving healthy ones relatively undamaged The technique was used to identify PARP1 inhibitors to treat BRCA1BRCA2associated cancers In this case the combined presence of PARP1 inhibition and of the cancerassociated mutations in BRCA genes is lethal only to the cancerous cells

The Cancer Genome Project is an initiative to map out all somatic mutations in cancer The project systematically sequences the exons and flanking splice junctions of the genomes of primary tumors and cancerous cell lines COSMIC software displays the data generated from these experiments As of February 2008 the CGP had identified 4746 genes and 2985 mutations in 1848 tumours

The Cancer Genome Anatomy Project includes information of research on cancer genomes transcriptomes and proteomes

Progenetix is an oncogenomic reference database presenting cytogenetic and molecularcytogenetic tumor data

Oncomine has compiled data from cancer transcriptome profiles

The integrative oncogenomics database IntOGen and the Gitools datasets integrate multidimensional human oncogenomic data classified by tumor type The first version of IntOGen focused on the role of deregulated gene expression and CNV in cancer A later version emphasized mutational cancer driver genes across 28 tumor types All releases of IntOGen data are made available at the IntOGen database

The International Cancer Genome Consortium is the biggest project to collect human cancer genome data The data is accessible through the ICGC website The BioExpress Oncology Suite contains gene expression data from primary metastatic and benign tumor samples and normal samples including matched adjacent controls The suite includes hematological malignancy samples for many wellknown cancers

Specific databases for model animals include the Retrovirus Tagged Cancer Gene Database RTCGD that compiled research on retroviral and transposon insertional mutagenesis in mouse tumors

Mutational analysis of entire gene families revealed that genes of the same family have similar functions as predicted by similar coding sequences and protein domains Two such classes are the kinase family involved in adding phosphate groups to proteins and the phosphatase family involved with removing phosphate groups from proteins These families were first examined because of their apparent role in transducing cellular signals of cell growth or death In particular more than 50 of colorectal cancers carry a mutation in a kinase or phosphatase gene Phosphatidylinositold 3kinases PIK3CA gene encodes for lipid kinases that commonly contain mutations in colorectal breast gastric lung and various other cancers Drug therapies can inhibit PIK3CA Another example is the BRAF gene one of the first to be implicated in melanomas BRAF encodes a serinethreonine kinase that is involved in the RASRAFMAPK growth signaling pathway Mutations in BRAF cause constitutive phosphorylation and activity in 59 of melanomas Before BRAF the genetic mechanism of melanoma development was unknown and therefore prognosis for patients was poor

Mitochondrial DNA mtDNA mutations are linked the formation of tumors Four types of mtDNA mutations have been identified

Point mutations have been observed in the coding and noncoding region of the mtDNA contained in cancer cells In individuals with bladder headneck and lung cancers the point mutations within the coding region show signs of resembling each other This suggests that when a healthy cell transforms into a tumor cell a neoplastic transformation the mitochondria seem to become homogenous Abundant point mutations located within the noncoding region Dloop of the cancerous mitochondria suggest that mutations within this region might be an important characteristic in some cancers

This type of mutation is sporadically detected due to its small size   1kb The appearance of certain specific mtDNA mutations 264bp deletion and 66bp deletion in the complex 1 subunit gene ND1 in multiple types of cancer provide some evidence that small mtDNA deletions might appear at the beginning of tumorigenesis It also suggests that the amount of mitochondria containing these deletions increases as the tumor progresses An exception is a relatively large deletion that appears in many cancers known as the common deletion but more mtDNA large scale deletions have been found in normal cells compared to tumor cells This may be due to a seemingly adaptive process of tumor cells to eliminate any mitochondria that contain these large scale deletions the common deletion is  4kb

Two small mtDNA insertions of 260 and 520 bp can be present in breast cancer gastric cancer hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and colon cancer and in normal cells No correlation between these insertions and cancer are established

The characterization of mtDNA via realtime polymerase chain reaction assays shows the presence of quantitative alteration of mtDNA copy number in many cancers Increase in copy number is expected to occur because of oxidative stress On the other hand decrease is thought to be caused by somatic point mutations in the replication origin site of the Hstrand andor the D310 homopolymeric cstretch in the Dloop region mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene mediated pathway andor inefficient enzyme activity due to POLG mutations Any increasedecrease in copy number then remains constant within tumor cells The fact that the amount of mtDNA is constant in tumor cells suggests that the amount of mtDNA is controlled by a much more complicated system in tumor cells rather than simply altered as a consequence of abnormal cell proliferation The role of mtDNA content in human cancers apparently varies for particular tumor types or sites
577 500867 contained somatic point putations and of the 1172 mutations surveyed 378 4431127 were located in the Dloop control region 131 1541172 were located in the tRNA or rRNA genes and 491 5751127 were found in the mRNA genes needed for producing complexes required for mitochondrial respiration

Some anticancer drugs target mtDNA and have shown positive results in killing tumor cells Research has used mitochondrial mutations as biomarkers for cancer cell therapy It is easier to target mutation within mitochondrial DNA versus nuclear DNA because the mitochondrial genome is much smaller and easier to screen for specific mutations MtDNA content alterations found in blood samples might be able to serve as a screening marker for predicting future cancer susceptibility as well as tracking malignant tumor progression Along with these potential helpful characteristics of mtDNA it is not under the control of the cell cycle and is important for maintaining ATP generation and mitochondrial homeostasis These characteristics make targeting mtDNA a practical therapeutic strategy

Several biomarkers can be useful in cancer staging prognosis and treatment They can range from singlenucleotide polymorphisms SNPs chromosomal aberrations changes in DNA copy number microsatellite instability promoter region methylation or even high or low protein levels

Ohlange High School
Ohlange High School is a secondary school in Inanda KwaZuluNatal South Africa It was founded by John Dube and Nokutela Dube ne Mdima It was the first school in South Africa started by a black person John Dube was also the first President of what became the ANC The school was chosen by President Nelson Mandela as the place where he would cast his vote in the first racially inclusive election in South Africa in 1994

The school was founded in 1900 as the Zulu Christian Industrial School by John Langalibalele Dube and his first wife Nokutela The school also known as the Ohlange Native Industrial Institute was the first educational institution in South Africa to be founded by a black person The land for the school was donated by Chief Mqhawe of the AmaQadi John had been in contact with Booker T Washington and modeled the school after the Tuskegee University in America As a result the Zulu Christian Industrial Institute laid emphasis on developing selfreliance in its students In 1901 the school was renamed the Ohlange Institute The school was called Ohlange by Dupe based on the word uhlanga which means the point of new growth in a plant or an ancestor for a descended family

The school was so popular initially that students were sleeping without beds The finances were difficult in the first few years A solution to this came from an American committee that supported Dupes belief that Christian conversion could be achieved via industrial education A leading member of the committee was the Illinois pastor Sidney Dix Strong who had visited South Africa and had included the Ohlange Institute to his itinerary Strongs wife died on the journey back to Chicago and Strong decided to use the Ohlange cause to distract himself from his loss

Strong was able to arrange for the Dubes to meet Douglas and Emaroy June Smith who became rich due to patent medicines and in time from the Pepsodent toothpaste brand They donated thousands of dollars to the school which enabled for more teachers to be employed This was in addition to the money that Dube obtained from the family of Anson Phelps Stokes 

By 1904 the finances needed further attention and Dube was unable to find any help in Natal He had to return to America and he left John Mdima in charge of both the school and the newspaper In Brooklyn he met the new chair of the committee S Parkes Cadman who was pastor of the Central Congregational church in Brooklyn Cadman reorganised the funding arranging for benefactors to sponsor students for 30 a year and arranging for Dubes helpers and family including John Mdima to go to college The Dubes spent fifteen months in the states with John speaking and his wife singing June Emaroy Smith was particularly generous and funded the 1907 construction of a boys building Dube noted in his talks that the Afro American was largely Christian whereas the native African had only limited access to the Christian message
In its early years the school taught not only basic education but also vocational skills such as journalism shoe and dressmaking carpentry motor mechanics and agriculture Dube contributed to the administration as well as teaching journalism The academic side was not ignored and in 1915 the first Ohlange students went to study at the University College of the Cape of Good Hope 1917 saw the construction of a girls dormitory The purpose here was to establish a teacher training centre which was seen as a female career

Enoch Sontonga song which later became a South African national anthem became better known after Ohlange Institutes choir used it They played it at the South African Native National Congress meeting in 1912 It was sung after the closing prayer and the ANC adopted it as its official closing anthem in 1925

On 27 April 1994 Nelson Mandela cast his vote in his countrys first allrace elections at a polling booth in the school Mandela chose the area because he wanted to give the native black population the confidence to vote He chose Ohlange school in particular because this is where John Dupe the first President of what was to become the ANC was buried and he wanted to lay a wreath Mandela stood by the grave and said
Mr President I have come to report to you that South Africa is free today

Enrollment in 2012 was 865 with nearly 100 boarding at the school There were just over 60 staff with 34 being teachers in 2012

The school had a laboratory and a technical drawing room a computer and cooking room a library and 23 other classrooms in 2012 The admin block is in addition and the school had plans in 2012 to add six more classrooms and increase the computing facilities

In 2007 Ohlange was amongst several schools recognised as historic schools Funding of six million rand a year was earmarked for Ohlange Adams College Inkamana High School Inanda Seminary and Vryheid Comprehensive High School to make them academies focusing on Maths Science and Technology Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Njongonkulu Ndungane said that they still needed funds and little has been achieved since democracy

Prominent former pupils include the Nobel Laureate Albert Luthuli and the Deputy President Phumzile MlamboNgcuka who went back to her former school in May 2006 as part of the Global Campaign for Education Musical alumni include Reuben Caluza the singer Busi Mhlongo and the jazz musician Victor Ntoni Sportsman Stephen Mokone also studied here

Ammi Phillips
Ammi Phillips April 24 1788  July 11 1865 was an American itinerant portrait painter active in Connecticut Massachusetts and New York for five decades After his death he was forgotten for decades until his oeuvre was reconstructed by Barbara and Larry Holdridge collectors and students of American folk art with the eventual support of Mary Black art historian after many friendly arguments and challenges to prove their contention that Phillips was not only the Kent Limner but also the earlier Border Limner
The Holdridges extensive search in three states for Phillips paintings and for biographical details to be found in the Census Bureau and other written records as well as the fading memories of stillliving relatives of the artist and his portrait subjects from one of whom they learned the pronunciation of the artists first name Ammeye was triggered by their purchase in 1958 of one of the very few portraits signed on the reverse by the artist George C Sunderland Painted When at the Age of 21 years by Mr Ammi Phillips In the fall 1840

Phillips was born in Colebrook Connecticut on April 24 1788 beginning a life that spanned the period from the beginning of George Washingtons presidency to the end of the American Civil War His extensive continuously evolving oeuvre over a period of five decades provides posterity with a vast archive of early American selffashioning

While his early education remains obscure to history although Phillips is often considered a selftaught artist he may have apprenticed with another artist its clear that Phillips made up his mind to pursue a career as an artist while still young He enters the documentary record as an artist in 1809 at the age of 21 with advertisements in both The Berkshire Reporter and a Pittsfield Massachusetts tavern proclaiming his talent for painting correct likenesses distinguished by perfect shadows and elegantly dressed in the prevailing fashions of the day Although Phillips also advertised his talent for fancy painting silhouettes sign and ornamental painting he soon specialized as a portraitist His work satisfied the local standard and within two years Phillips was receiving regular portrait commissions from community leaders in this area of western Massachusetts

Unlike Phillips illustrious predecessors in American art such as Benjamin West of Philadelphia and John Singleton Copley of Boston Phillips lived and worked on the rural frontiera difference which is key to understanding his career Though he was able to successfully market his skills from a young age its likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits a luxury good that reflects and signals a certain social standing outside the capitals was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly family perhaps in tow between western Massachusetts Connecticut and the Hudson River Valley The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted likenesses This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits which are almost always set within interiors A letter from the American artist John Vanderlyn to his nephew John Vanderlyn Jr from Kingston New York dated September 9 1825 stated Were I to begin life again I should not hesitate to follow this plan that is to paint portraits cheap and slight for the mass of folks cant judge of the merits of a well finished picture I am more and more persuaded of this Indeed moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does must be an agreeable way of passing ones time I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburghs the other day painted a year or two ago which seemed to satisfy them

We may contrast this somewhat supercilious opinion of Phillips artistic worth with the conclusion of the twentiethcentury art critic Hilton Kramer who wrote in The New York Times in 1970 In the Plain and Fancy exhibition for example there are five portraits by the amazing Ammi Phillips 17881865 and at least two of themthe portraits of Mrs Isaac Cox and of Deacon Benjamin Benedict both about 1836are of superb quality To the modern eye the portrait of Mrs Cox particularly speaks with a clarity precision and sympathy that places it considerably nearer to our own standards of artistic probity than anything to be found in the common run of serious painting at the time If this is innocent painting it is innocent only of those flatulent academic pretensions which remained the curse of so much of our art in the 19th century
Phillips may actually have learned some of his skills from the portraits by John Vanderlyn he saw hanging in the homes of his wealthy patrons Some aspects of Phillips works are reminiscent of Vanderlyns

Ammi Phillips lived into the era of the daguerreotype and his last portraits show this influence He died on July 15 1865 age 72 in Curtisville Massachusetts just outside Stockbridge where his death certificate is filed in the Town Hall He was buried in Amenia New York where he had lived earlier in his life

The artists most famous work is Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog which is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum in New York The painting is one of a group of four portraits of children in vibrant red with a dog on the floor that Phillips produced while living in Dutchess County New York in the mid1830s This iconic work is the only one that features a cat

The image is frequently reproduced and admired It was featured on a United States postage stamp in 1998 Nicholas BA Nicholson wrote a novel told from the perspective of the depicted girl

Ken Johnson an art critic for The New York Times has repeatedly praised the picture In a review of the American Folk Art Museums exhibition SelfTaught Genius Johnson contends that Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog is one of the most beautiful paintings made by any American artist ever Previously he described the work as heartbreakingly lovely

The novelist and art historian Teju Cole in the third chapter of his debut novel Open City describes a visit to the American Folk Art Museum The narrator notices and evaluates Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog At the landing of the first flight of stairs I saw an oil portrait of a young girl in a starchy red dress holding a white cat A dog peeked out from under her chair The details were saccharine but they could not obscure the force and beauty of the painting

Phillips modern rediscovery began in 1924 when a group of portraits of women shown leaning forward in threequarter view and wearing dark dresses were displayed in an antique show in Kent Connecticut The anonymous painter of these strongly colored works which dated from the 1830s became known as the Kent Limner after the locality where they had come to light

Stylistically distinct from those of the Kent Limner a second group of early19thcentury paintings emerged after 1940 in the area near the ConnecticutNew York border Attributed at the time to an unknown Border Limner these works dating from the period 18121819 were characterized by soft pastel hues and limited drawing skills as seen in the portraits of Mrs Russell Dorr and Baby now in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Collection Williamsburg Virginia and of Harriet Leavens now in the Fogg Art Museum Harvard University

It was not until 1958 that Ammi Phillips identity as the painter of both groups of portraits was established by Barbara and Larry Holdridge and endorsed by Mary Black writing on May 21 1959 to three fellow folkart historians You are the ones who should be the first to know that I have joined the opposition ie the Holdridges and now believe that the Border Limner Ammi Phillips A Phillips and the Kent Limner are one and the same person Additional works were identified showing the artists transition from the delicate coloration of the Border period to the bold and dramatic works that followed Some paintings that had previously been attributed to John Bradley were also identified as the work of Ammi Phillips By 1976 there were approximately 400 paintings securely attributed to Phillips who is now recognized as one of the most prolific American folk painters of his time Scores more have been discovered since then

The art historian Mary Black said Phillips early and late styles reveal the untrained artists inventiveness in dealing with the difficulty of representing the figure In his Border period he made his limitations work for him and the lumpy coats gangling limbs huge hands wooden armseven the tables tilted at crazy angleswere all part of wellcomposed and beautiful portraits Later he glossed over problems with anatomy by using flat darkcolored backgrounds and dark dresses and suits Phillips work influenced the style of his younger contemporary Erastus Salisbury Field who worked as an itinerant portrait painter in the region just east of Phillips

The Museum of American Folk Art showed its first major exhibition devoted to the work of a single folk portraitist to Ammi Phillips Portrait Painter 17881865 on exhibit from October 16 to December 2 1968 There have been numerous notable exhibits since then

Jerome Kagan
Jerome Kagan born February 25 1929 is an American psychologist and Daniel and Amy Starch Research Professor of Psychology Emeritus at Harvard University and cofaculty at the New England Complex Systems Institute He is one of the key pioneers of developmental psychology

Kagan has shown that an infants temperament is quite stable over time in that certain behaviors in infancy are predictive of certain other behavior patterns in adolescence He did extensive work on temperament and gave insight on emotion Kagan was listed as the 22nd most eminent psychologist of the 20th century just above Carl Jung

Born in Newark New Jersey to Joseph and Myrtle Kagan Kagan grew up in Rahway New Jersey He chose to study psychology due to his attraction in being a scientist and to preserve his grandfathers interest in human nature He was accepted at Yale University to study Psychology where he earned his PhD and he earned his masters degree from Harvard University He earned a BS Degree from Rutgers University in 1950 While at Yale University he assisted Frank Beach a well respected researcher

After he graduated from Yale University he accepted his first faculty position at Ohio State University Six months later in 1955 he was recruited to be a part of the research team at the US Army Hospital during the Korean War
Once he had finished his time at the US Army Hospital the director of the Fels Research Institute contacted Kagan to ask him to direct a project that was funded by the National Institutes of Health which he accepted After that project was completed he accepted the offer he received from Harvard University to be involved in creating the first Human Development program Once he moved to Harvard he remained there until retirement with the exception of a leave to go and study children in San Marcos He did this for a year from 1971 to 1972 and then returned to Harvard as a professor

Kagan won the Hofheimer Prize of the American Psychiatric Association in 1963 In 1995 he won the G Stanley Hall Award of the American Psychological Association APA

While at Fels Kagan did extensive research on personality traits beginning with infancy and continued through adulthood He looked at whether or not early experiences affected the participants future personalities talents and characters Kagan read up on all of the longitudinal information that was prepared specifically the responses to intelligence tests that were administered to them When Kagan was reviewing the material collected in childhood and adulthood he found that the first three years in childhood showed little relation to the data collected in adulthood The results of the Fels study was discussed in Kagans book Birth to Maturity in 1962

Kagans next research was in San Marcos Guatemala During this time Kagan discovered that biological factors play a huge role in development and an even larger part in child development Specifically he found that these children had slower Psychological development when in their homes due to their restricted experiences Once the children were walking and could leave the home Kagan found that the psychological delay in development was only temporary and that cognitive growth is malleable In 2010 Kagan was involved in a similar study that focused on specific parts of the brain involved in behavioral inhibition in infants Schwartz et al 2010 performed a longitudinal study involving 18yearolds and used neuroimaging to detect whether or not the ventromedial or orbitofrontal cerebral cortex are associated with the highlow reactivity of their 4monthold selves After undergoing a battery of tests the infants were later categorized into two groups lowreactive and highreactive temperament Results showed that the adults who had lowreactive infant temperaments had greater thickness in the left orbitofrontal cortex than the highreactive group The adults categorized as highreactive infants displayed greater thickness in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex

While at Harvard University Kagan studied infants up to two years and published his work in his book The Second Year Kagans research found that there were major changes in Psychological functioning between 19 and 24 months and that oneyearold children were sensitive to events that deviated from their normal experiences Kagan also looked at the effects of infant daycare in response to Congress proposal to fund federal day care centers for working mothers Richard Kearsley Philip Zelazo and Kagan created their own daycare in Bostons Chinatown and compared these infants to infants who stayed at home with their mothers This research revealed very little difference between the infants in day care and those whose mothers stayed at home with them with respect to cognitive functioning language attachment separation protest and play tempo

Kagan proposed that emotion is a psychological phenomenon controlled by brain states and that specific emotions are products of context the persons history and biological makeup Kagan also explained emotion as occurring in four distinct phases including the brain state created by an incentive the detection of changes in bodily movement the appraisal of a change in bodily feeling and the observable changes in facial expression and muscle tension These emotions vary in magnitude and usually differ across ages and when expressed in different contexts
Kagan questioned relying on individuals verbal statements of their feelings He provided several reasons for this he argued that the English language does not have enough words to describe all emotional states the words to explain emotional states do not convey the differences in quality or severity and translating emotion words from one language to another produces variations and inaccuracies In addition Kagan argued that research in emotion studies should be free of ambiguous and coded terms and this emphasis on specificity remains a recurring theme in his current research on emotion He called for a moratorium on the use of single words eg fear to write about emotional process urging experts to instead use full sentences

According to Kagan conventionally

Temperament is perhaps what Kagan is best known for He began his work on temperament after his research in Guatemala Kagan primarily focused on childrens fear and apprehension He defined two types of temperament inhibited and uninhibited Inhibited refers to a shy timid and fearful profile of a child whereas uninhibited refers to the appearance of bold sociable and outgoing behaviours Kagan found that at four months inhibited infants tend to fuss and show heightened responses to novel objects eg brightly colored toy and display intense physiological arousal to situations that barely attract uninhibited infants In Kagans first published work on behaviourally inhibited children he established the connection between his work on behavioural inhibition to the works of neuroscientists like Joseph LeDoux and Michael Davis

In 2008 Kagan and several other researchers conducted a study to examine if behavioral inhibition in adulthood can be predicted by certain behavioral characteristics in infants The research hypothesized that the frequency of infant reactivity based on motor and crying dimensions is predictive of behavioral inhibition As a result of his ground breaking work on temperament we know that these characteristics have the ability to influence later behavior depending on how they interact with the environment Kagan also believed that there is no guarantee of an indefinitely stable profile considering environmental factors are always changing and that both genes and environmental factors influence a childs temperament

Fiorentini
Engineer Filippo Fiorentini founded the Fiorentini  C SpA factory of excavators in 1919 in Rome Italy He imported and distributed construction equipment During the time of Fascism restrictions banned import and Ing Fiorentini started his manufacturing plant in Via Tiburtina near Stazione Tiburtina San Lorenzo in Roma for the construction of excavators such as scrapersdraglines and cranes under the license of an American company named Bucyrus

The first excavators models FB35 and FB38 were entirely built on site from 1930 to 1940 Around the 1930s Fiorentini also opened a factory in Fabriano

Fiorentini machines assisted all major Italian public works from 1930s  New models were scheduled to be produced but were delayed by World War II During the war in 1943 117 workers died in the factory attacked by bombs dropped by the American military Grassi 2012 Eng Filippo Fiorentini and his wife died shortly after of broken heart Their only son Giuseppe also an Engineer had the courage to start a new business activity and in 1951 he was so successful that he was ranked at the top of Rome tax payers The IngFFiorentini  C SPA relocated further along the Tiburtina road to a bigger plant more modern and very effective After World War II the company produced FB50 60 100 and the massive FB200 that could hold 1000 tons In the 1960s there were some design changes The company also produced bulldozers and hydraulic excavators 
By studying Russian Ing Giuseppe travelled to the Soviet Union and sold two big contracts with their ministry Machino Import of some 1000 cranes to be used in the enormous project of the Transiberian Pipeline

At that time the Company had won a technical and commercial battle against other companies from Germany much bigger ones than the Ing FFiorentini  C of Rome As the sales were strong both inside Italy for the reconstruction and in Russia the Company hired as many as 1000 employees who were working in three plants Rome Fabriano in Italy and Toronto Ontario Canada

In 1956 Count Giuseppe Fiorentini bought a second castle after the San Gallo castle in Nettuno from prince Barberini the farm estate and castle of San fabiano A hunting resort San Fabiano was useful for its public relations where he invited many of his clients such as the Russian Ambassador Rijov and Mac Cormick of International Harvester In fact the Company was designing and manufacturing cranes excavators and crushing plants and represented for Italy the industrial line of HI

Twister supersonic separator
The Twister supersonic separator is a compact tubular device which is used for removing water andor hydrocarbon dewpointing of natural gas The principle of operation is similar to the near isentropic Brayton cycle of a turboexpander The gas is accelerated to supersonic velocities within the tube using a De Laval nozzle and inlet guide vanes spin the gas around an innerbody which creates the ballerina effect and centrifugally separates the water and liquids in the tube Hydrates do not form in the Twister tube due to the very short residence time of the gas in the tube around 2 milliseconds A secondary separator treats the liquids and slip gas and also acts as a hydrate control vessel Twister is able to dehydrate to typical pipeline dewpoint specifications and relies on a pressure drop from the inlet of about 25 dependent on the performance required The fundamental mathematics behind supersonic separation can be found in the Society of Petroleum Engineers paper number 100442 entitled Selective Removal of Water from Supercritical Natural Gas The closed Twister system enables subsea gas treatment subsea

Philippine television drama
Philippine television drama also known as teleserye Filipino telenovelas or Pdrama is a form of melodramatic serialized fiction in television in the Philippines Teleserye is derived from two Filipino words tele which is short for telebisyn television and srye series

Teleseryes share some characteristics and have similar roots with classic soap operas and telenovelas yet the teleserye has evolved into a genre with its own unique characteristics often working as a social realist reflection of Filipino reality Teleseryes are aired in primetime afternoon five days a week They attract a broad audience crossing age and gender lines and they command the highest advertising rates in the Philippine television industry The series last anywhere from three months to a year or even longer depending on their rating

Other forms of Philippine dramas include serials and anthologies which are usually shown on a weekly basis These dramas are also intended to air a finite number of episodes usually lasting one season depending on the ratings

Soap operas in the Philippines originated when Gulong ng Palad Wheel of Fortune was first heard on the radio in 1949 The genre then expanded into television in the early 1960s The first Philippine TV soap opera was Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato The Magic Stone House in 1963 and was produced by ABSCBN Larawan ng Pagibig Picture of Love Prinsipe Amante Prince Amante and many others soon followed

Gulong ng Palad cowritten by revival writer Loida Virina was the longestrunning radio serial that spanned for two decades until the mid 80s It was made into a television soap opera starring Marianne Dela Riva and Ronald Corveau created stars out of many young actors like Romnick Sarmenta and starred veteran actress Caridad Sanchez whose popularity helped sustain the soaps lifetime

During the martial law period in 1972 to 1986 the government closed several networks leaving RPN9 and GMA as the only two commercial television networks in the country allowed to broadcast nationwide spurring a dramatic growth of teleseryes as a result of the fierce competition between the two networks

RPN9 produced Flordeluna starring awardwinning actress Janice de Belen The cast also included Drama King Dindo Fernando and awardwinning actress and director Laurice Guillen At the same time GMA produced the hit tale Anna Liza starring child actress and FAMAS awardee Julie Vega This marked one of the biggest rivalries in Philippine showbiz history between Vega and de Belen despite being highlighted as bestfriends offscreen However Anna Liza was cancelled in 1985 due to Julie Vegas death and as a result the series had an unfinished storyline and a twohour special in 1986 which was supposedly its final year on air Both series were controversial from the start due to the rivalry between the fanbases of Vega and de Belen

Until the late 1980s Philippine television dramas were broadcast in afternoon timeblocks ABSCBN resumed operations after the expulsion of the Marcos dictatorship in 1986 and regained its lead among rival networks in audience ratings by the end of the decade By the 1990s a new wave of international television phenomenon swept the Philippines starting with the teleserye craze over ABSCBN imported Mexican dramas 

The most popular were the Las Tres Marias Trilogy produced by the worldleading Televisa and starred by Thala starting with Maria Mercedes shown on ABSCBN and Marimar and later Maria La Del Barrio shown on RPN9 both as primetime shows By this time major networks began to reschedule locally made telenovelas now called teleserye into primetime slots to encourage more Filipino audiences to watch at night and for advertisers to invest more on these shows By the mid1990s teleseryes surpassed sitcoms both in number of shows produced and in nationwide audience ratings as the most dominant form of primetime television in the Philippines

The 1990s television dramas boosted the careers of several actors and actresses who became household names in the Philippines during and after the end of their shows original runs 

A longrunning dramas that stands out is ABSCBNs drama Mara Clara which run from 1992 to 1997 gaining nationwide popularity due to the intense rivalry between its two stars and characters Judy Ann Santos as the protagonist Mara and Gladys Reyes as the evil antagonist Clara The series became the longestrunning postMartial Law teleserye in Philippine television history experiencing frequent timeslot changes before settling into the standard 700 PM800 PM primetime block by late 1995 Mara Clara is also credited for being the countrys first successful teleserye to spawn a similarly successful movie under the same name Santos would continue her television success between 1997 and 1999 in the iconic drama series titled Esperanza A film was also made after this dramas finale in 1999 A 1997 Esperanza episode currently holds the record for the alltime highest rated single episode for any Philippine television series

The teleserye Valiente ran from 1992 to 1997 its first 2 and a half years on ABSCBN and 2 years on GMA7 

Judy Ann Santos was touted the first Primetime Queen of Philippine television and earned the title Queen of Soap Operas for her roles in Mara Clara and Esperanza But in mid1997 another series Mula sa Puso From The Heart gave fame to the second Primetime Queen Claudine Barretto where she played the heiress Via in the 2yearlong soap together with her leading men Rico Yan and Diether Ocampo and Princess Punzalan as Selina the most influential character of the series Punzalans antagonist performance was highly regarded among the best on Philippine television setting standards for future Filipino telenovela villains The intense rivalry between the characters of Punzalan and Jacklyn Jose as Vias mother Magda became an icon for most of the succeeding decades on Philippine television Simultaneously running with Esperanza both programs pioneered crossover episodes among Philippine teleserye during the same period and Mula sa Puso spawned another successful movie after its finale in 1999

Meanwhile rival networks GMA retained and even popularized their afternoon serialized dramas form such as Villa Quintana with lead stars Donna Cruz as Lynette Quintana and Keempee de Leon as Isagani Samonte with Isabel Rivas as Stella Quintana which airs from 1995 to 1997 This was followed by Ikaw Na Sana with lead characters Angelu de Leon as Blanca Rosales Perez  Susan Saavedra and Bobby Andrews as Rafael Huico with Gladys Reyes as Angela Rosales which airs between 1997 and 1998 and a film was made after this show 

At the peak of both these GMA afternoon shows fame they were moved to primetime slots by the end of the 1990s to compete with ABSCBNs rise on national television with their primetime serials a foreshadow of what would eventually be the touted primetime television series blocks for both rival networks

Modern Philippine television dramas have begun to evolve to todays modern form called teleserye a portmanteau of the Filipino words telebisyon television and serye series The term originated from the ABSCBN hit drama Pangako Sa Yo airing from 2000 to 2002 and starring Jericho Rosales and Kristine Hermosa and the iconic rivalry between actresses Eula Valdez as the original Amor de JesusPowers and Jean Garcia as the original Claudia Buenavista The tandem of Valdez and Garcia in the original Pangako SaYo is widely regarded as the most successful rivalry of main characters in all of Philippine television setting the standards for future teleserye ensemble casts 

Pangako SaYo is dubbed as the countrys first ever teleserye and was considered one of the most significant turning points in Philippine television history due to its pioneering cinematic production and modified fastpaced multiplearc story structure distinguishing it from previous Filipino telenovelas It was broadcast internationally in many networks across the Americas Africa and Asia and remains the most successful Philippine television series internationally At the end of its run in 2002 Pangako Sa Yo remains as the recordholder of the alltime highest rated series finale episode for any locally made program in Philippine television history and firmly established the current primetime block of ABSCBN

Pangako Sa Yo effectively became the highest rated teleserye by average both domestically and internationally in all of Philippine television history and inspired ABSCBN to produce in mid2002 its leadout teleserye Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay Already concluded in 2003 the show introduced the highly acclaimed tandem of John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo as one of the countrys most successful longestablished television and film loveteams until today Also known for the iconic performance of Lorna Tolentino as the protagonist twins Lorrea and Lorrinda Guinto it became the nations first ever local television series to become a finalist to the Best Drama Series category of the International Emmy Awards in 2003 marking the rise of the Philippines on the world television programming stage

Rosales and Hermosa along with Diether Ocampo and Angelika dela Cruz would altogether star in another teleserye classic Sanay Wala Nang Wakas Airing between 2003 and 2004 Sanay Wala Nang Wakas became the worlds first ever drama series allowing its viewers to choose the storys ending through text messaging Another groundbreaking teleserye of ABSCBN was Bastat Kasama Kita airing around the same period as of Sanay Wala Nang Wakas Starring Judy Ann Santos and Robin Padilla the show was notable for its depiction of the countrys National Bureau of Investigation and for being the countrys first ever local television series to broadcast a live series finale episode in 2004 This introduced the live format of series finales among fictional series on Philippine television  a feat only few teleseryes had accomplished until today Both series followed Pangako SaYo to be broadcast abroad marking the rise of Philippines to international prominence in television drama production

ABSCBNs fortunes would soon increase with its 19992001 series Saan Ka Man Naroroon starring Claudine Barretto on lead role as triplets Rosemarie Rosenda and Rosario The show was critically acclaimed and became one of the few groundbreaking shows of the 2000s in the Philippines starring a female lead character as well as the countrys first teleserye with at least two characters portrayed simultaneously by one actor 

Barretto would consequently gain prominence for her lead role on Sa Dulo Ng Walang Hanggan a timeless love story of the undying love of Angeline CrisostomoAngelina whose mistakes that appear in the present had also happened in the past it uncovered the lies and the love of all around her which was actually reincarnated into the present She was also the lead star of the popular teleserye Marina Airing in 2004 the show popularized the fantasy theme throughout most of the incoming teleseryes in the Philippines becoming the first original fantasy series made for television to score success on Philippine primetime television ratings 

The Philippines began emerging as one of the worlds largest television dramaproducing nations in the mid2000s Several of its international hits include the 2006 remake of Gulong ng Palad on ABSCBN with its cast including Kristine Hermosa as Luisa TJ Trinidad as Carding and Cherie Gil as Philiomena Menang Medel the corrupt town mayor and also the main antagonist of the series The role of Mimi was given to Andrea del Rosario and Rio Locsin as Caridad Idad Santos The series was popular amongst international viewers through TFC In 2007 the remake of Maria Flordeluna which previously aired on RPN9 through most of the 1970s and 1980s starred young actress Eliza Pineda as the titular character It also starred Albert Martinez as Leo Alicante Eula Valdez as Mary Jo Esperitu and John Estrada as Gary Alvarado The series ran on ABSCBN for 93 episodes and won the PMPC Star Awards Best Television Series in 2008 and popularized the trend of remaking classic childstarred Philippine telenovelas of the past

To pit against its rival network GMA Network started producing their own set of primetime soap opera starting with the toprating drama series Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin starring drama actress Angelika dela Cruz which aired from 2001 to 2002 and Sana Ay Ikaw Na Nga starring Dingdong Dantes It was successfully shown in Malaysia and other Asian countries Another was the political drama Kung Mawawala Ka also became one of the most loved powerful dramas which revolved on politics and even on issues of corruption Starring Eddie Garcia as the shows main character and lead antagonist it also showed the dramatic abilities of actresses Hilda Koronel Liza Lorena and Gloria Diaz as the powerful wives The series ran between 2001 and 2002 and also won a PMPC Award from the Philippine Movie Press Club It was also the most popular GMAmade drama as well as the most successful single telenovela pitted against the ongoing television drama Pangako Sa Yo which also reached its end in 2002 

It was not until 2004 however when GMA Network overtook ABSCBN in the national ratings when the former introduced an allfantaserye a portmanteau of fantasy and teleserye ie fantasythemed teleseryes primetime slate by 2005 through the successful broadcasts of femalelead shows such as Encantadia which originally starred Iza Calzado Karylle Sunshine Dizon and Diana Zubiri and Mulawin starring the successful tandem of Angel Locsin and Richard Gutierrez GMA earned ratings foothold against its main rival ABSCBN during this time when it brought life to Darna a role reprised by the most famous Darna of all time Vilma Santos in the late 1970s and early 1980s and starring Angel Locsin in its first television remake and ushered the era of filmturnedTV remakes on Philippine television

2010s also marked the renewed popularity of longterm afternoon dramas on Philippine television after a temporary decline in the late 1990s From 2014 to 2016 GMA broadcast The Half Sisters which starred teen actresses Barbie Forteza and Thea Tolentino Also noted for the performances of veteran actors Jomari Yllana and Jean Garcia the show became the networks most successful teleserye in and out of the Philippines since the 2013 final episode of My Husbands Lover Julia Montes topbilled the ABSCBN hit afternoon teleserye Doble Kara which ran between 2015 and 2017 The show was moved in early 2016 to the 320 PM time slot after its noontime show Its Showtime extended their time occupation then it competed the remake of Sinungaling Mong Puso in its rival GMA Network Due to its continuous high ratings it was extended and became the networks first teleserye to air for more than a year since the 2014 final episode of Be Careful With My Heart Its leadout teleserye Tubig at Langis airing in 2016 earned nationwide popularity because of the intense rivalry of lead actresses Cristine Reyes and Isabelle Daza as Irene and Clara respectively

During the same decade the live format for teleserye final episodes returned on Philippine television for the first time since the finale of GMAs 2007 Philippine remake of Marimar ABSCBN earned national attention in 2016 alone for concluding the runs of shortlived but otherwise popular teenoriented primetime shows On the Wings of Love and Born for You On the Wings of Love was the first primetime show starring newcomer tandem James Reid and Nadine Lustre while Born for You became the first musicalthemed teleserye on Philippine television since the end of ABSCBNs 2006 television adaptation of Bituing Walang Ningning and marked the primetime debut of Janella Salvador after starring in Be Careful With My Heart and network newcomer Elmo Magalona

The 2008 hit series Lobo produced 2 more sequels Imortal on 2010 and La Luna Sangre on 2017 with all three shows airing on ABSCBN and starred by Angel Locsin While Imortal previously starred John Lloyd Cruz La Luna Sangre was the first primetime project of Daniel Padilla and Kathryn Bernardo since the 2016 series finale of the Pangako SaYo remake as well as the first major project on ABSCBN by Richard Gutierrez after his tenure on GMA Network and TV5 It was also the first project of Locsin and Gutierrez as a tandem since their popularity on Mulawin on GMA in the mid2000s

The range of popularity of Philippine drama since the early 2000s had spun overseas becoming popular throughout Asia and Africa and has appealed widely to overseas Filipino communities in North America as well Teleseryes have since evolved distinctly from most of the worlds telenovelas throughout decades and highlight the countrys position among the worlds most successful television drama producers Several of the Philippine teleseryes had emerged as among the most watched television programs in even difficult markets such as Indonesia Malaysia and China Considered one of the countrys most vital economic and cultural exports they are often dubbed into local languages and sometimes has English and other foreign subtitles displayed when imported into those markets

ABSCBN and GMA are among the pioneering television producers in Asia to have exported their classical dramas several of which reflect the reality of Filipino and other similar Asian societies and have a universal message Pangako Sa Yo My Promise to You is one of the most successful Philippine dramas abroad And soaps such as Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay and Recuerdo De Amor followedPrior to topping the national television ratings in China in the mid2000s the story gained wide popularity to more than 1 billion viewers alone in Southeast Asia and Africa ABSCBN also introduced a website called ABSCBN International Sales for easy access to their shows Other ABSCBN shows like Sana Maulit Muli Taiwan Lobo dubbed as SheWolf The Last Sentinel Tayong Dalawa Dahil May Isang Ikaw Kahit Isang Saglit Katorse the 2010 version of Mara Clara remake Magkaribal Be Careful With My Heart Vietnam and Walang Hanggan were also exported These were followed by simultaneous broadcasts of shows such as Ina Kapatid Anak May Bukas Pa Forevermore Till I Met You Wildflower and the currently airing television adaptation of Ang Probinsyano at around the same time in the Philippines and overseas by the mid2010s as a result of their popularity in and out of the country

GMA Network still holds the record for most highest rating pilot episodes including Darna and Encantadia both in 2005 GMA also pioneered and engineered the TELEFANTASYA in Television with the tv hit series Mulawin in 2004 that gathered the attention of viewers in the Philippines and followed suit through Boys Next Door a teen melodrama which was the first Philippine television series aired in South Korea which is considered among one of the top rival exporters of television series in Asia The 2007 Philippine adaptation of MariMar became GMAs alltime most successful television series in and out of the Philippinesand still holds the record with their 58 national viewers and was aired to wide popularity in Thailand Malaysia China Singapore Indonesia Cambodia Vietnam Uganda Tanzania Kenya and Hawaii Other GMA shows such as Habang Kapiling Ka Kahit Kailan Bakekang Muli Impostora Mga Mata ni Anghelita Dyesebel and Encantadia are still broadcast in some countries in Asia and Africa Both ABSCBN and GMA are considered top exporters of television dramas to most of Southeast Asia and Africa in the recent yearswith GMA the most successful in exporting their shows because of their original and effective concept especially with The Half Sisters and Ika6 na Utos

In recent years Philippine television drama has gained international recognition from international awardgiving bodies cementing the reputation of the Philippines among the worlds most prolific television drama producers Most of these nominated dramas were from ABSCBN It started with Lobo winning the Best Telenovela category in the 30th BANFF World Television Festival Several dramas were also nominated in the International Emmy for the telenovela category including ABSCBNs Kay Tagal Kang Hinintay Dahil May Isang Ikaw Kahit Isang Saglit Bridges of Love and GMAs Magdusa Ka and My Husbands Lover Be Careful With My Heart of ABSCBN was recently nominated in the 2013 New York Festivals TV and Film Awards Angel Locsin Sid Lucero and Jodi Sta Maria are to date the only Filipinos to be nominated at the International Emmys for Best Actor and Best Actress in a Drama Series for their respective roles in the 2009 series Lobo 2010 series Dahil May Isang Ikaw and the 20152016 remake of Pangako Sa Yo

Load bank
A load bank is a device which develops an electrical load applies the load to an electrical power source and converts or dissipates the resultant power output of the source
A load bank includes load elements with protection control metering and accessory devices required for operation Load banks can either be permanently installed at a facility and permanently connected to a power source or portable versions can be used for testing power sources such as standby generators and batteries Load banks are the best way to replicate prove and verify the reallife demands on critical power systems  

Load banks are used in a variety of applications including


The three most common types of load banks are resistive inductive and capacitive Both inductive and capacitive loads create what is known as reactance in an AC circuit Reactance is a circuit elements opposition to an alternating current caused by the buildup of electric or magnetic fields in the element due to the current and is the imaginary component of impedance or the resistance to AC signals at a certain frequency Capacitive reactance is equal to 12fC and inductive reactance is equal to 2fL The unit of reactance is the ohm Inductive reactance resists the change to current causing the circuit current to lag voltage Capacitive reactance resists the change to voltage causing the circuit current to lead voltage 

A resistive load bank the most common type provides equivalent loading for both generators and prime movers That is for each kilowatt or horsepower of load applied to the generator by the load bank an equal amount of load is applied to the prime mover by the generator A resistive load bank therefore removes energy from the complete system load bank from generatorgenerator from prime moverprime mover from fuel Additional energy is removed as a consequence of resistive load bank operation waste heat from coolant exhaust and generator losses and energy consumed by accessory devices A resistive load bank impacts upon all aspects of a generating system

The load of a resistive load bank is created by the conversion of electrical energy to heat via highpower resistors such as grid resistors This heat must be dissipated from the load bank either by air or by water by forced means or convection

In a testing system a resistive load simulates reallife resistive loads such as incandescent lighting and heating loads as well as the resistive or unity power factor component of magnetic motors transformers loads

The most common type uses wire resistance usually with fan cooling and this type is often portable and moved from generator to generator for test purposes Sometimes a load of this type is built into a building but this is unusual

Rarely a salt water rheostat is used It can be readily improvised which makes it useful in remote locations

For testing automotive batteries a carbon pile load bank allows an adjustable load to be placed on the battery or charging system allowing accurate simulation of the heavy load on the battery during cranking of the engine Such devices are usually portable and may include metering to show voltage and current 

An inductive load includes inductive lagging power factor loads

An inductive load consists of an ironcore reactive element which when used in conjunction with a resistive load bank creates a lagging power factor load Typically the inductive load will be rated at a numeric value 75 that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 08 power factor load is provided That is to say for each 100kW of resistive load 75 kVAr of inductive load is provided Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings An inductive load is used to simulate a reallife mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting heating motors transformers etc With a resistiveinductive load bank full power system testing is possible because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators voltage regulators load tap changers conductors switchgear and other equipment
A capacitive load bank or capacitor bank is similar to an inductive load bank in rating and purpose except leading power factor loads are created so reactive power is supplied from these loads to the system hence improves the power factor These loads simulate certain electronic or nonlinear loads typical of telecommunications computer or UPS industries

A combined load bank usually consists of both resistive elements and inductors that can be used to provide load testing at nonunity PF lagging including the capability to test the generator set fully at 100 nameplate kVA rating Combined load banks incorporate resistors and inductors all in a single construction which can be independently switched to allow resistive only inductive only or varying lagging power factor testing Combined load banks are rated in kilovoltamperes kVA Its worth noting that combined load banks can consist of resistive inductive and capacitive RLC also

Typically facilities require motordriven devices transformers and capacitors If this is the case then the load banks used for testing require reactive power compensation The ideal solution is a combination of both resistive and reactive elements in one load bank package 

Resistivereactive loads are able to mimic motor loads and electromagnetic devices within a power system as well as provide purely resistive loads

Many backup generators and turbines need to be commissioned at nameplate capacity using a combination of resistive and reactive load to fully qualify their operating capability Using a resistivereactive load bank enables comprehensive testing from a single unit A range of resistivereactive load banks are available to simulate these types of loads on a power source and the transformers relays and switches which will distribute the power throughout the facility

Resistivereactive load banks are great choices for testing turbines switchgear rotary UPS generators and UPS systems They can also be used for integrated system testing of utility substation protection systems particularly for more complex relays like distance directional overcurrent power directional and others A resistivereactive inductive andor capacitive load is often required to test solar inverters to ensure solar panels can be stopped from producing electricity in the event of a power outage The resistivereactive combination load banks are used to test the engine generator set at its rated power factor In most cases this is 08 power factor

An electronic load bank tends to be a fully programmable air or watercooled design used to simulate a solid state load and to provide constant power and current loading on circuits for precision testing

Where a dieselelectric locomotive is equipped for dynamic braking the braking resistor may be used as a load bank for testing the enginegenerator set

Interstate 80 in Illinois
Interstate 80 I80 is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from San Francisco California to Teaneck New Jersey I80 enters Illinois from Iowa in the west southwest of Rapids City and runs generally eastward through East Moline LaSalle and Joliet before entering Indiana in Lansing The interstate runs for approximately through the state

In the 1920s two state highways followed the general alignment that I80 takes In 1932 US 6 was extended through Illinois paralleling the alignment that I80 in Illinois Construction started in 1957 and I80 was completed in 1968 In the early 1990s Illinois wanted to reroute I80 in the Quad Cities area At the same time the section of I80 that is concurrent with I294 was reconstructed The portion of I80 that is concurrent with the Kingery Expressway was rebuilt in the mid2000s

Interstate 80 extends from west to east across the northern portion of the state through the population centers of Quad Cities and the south Chicago suburbs The freeway is mostly maintained by Illinois Department of Transportation IDOT with Illinois State Toll Highway Authority ISTHA maintaining the section of I80 that is concurrent with the TriState Tollway The busiest section of the freeway is between the I94 and IL83 interchanges in Lansing Approximately 181200 vehicles used the freeway on average each day in 2011 in contrast the lowest traffic level was 16400 vehicles between the IL 78 and IL 40 interchanges in Henry and Bureau Counties I80 contains between a minimum of four lanes and a maximum of ten lanes total The majority of the highway runs through farmland and urban areas

I80 enters Illinois on the Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River southwest of Rapids City After leaving the bridge the interstate has a folded diamond interchange with IL84 The highway heads south as a fourlane interstate passing along the east side of the Quad Cities Eastbound I80 traffic has access to an Illinois Welcome Center The road has a cloverleaf interchange with the western terminus of I88 After the interchange with I88 the highway crosses over Rock River The interstate has a diamond interchange with US Route 6 US6 before having an interchange with I74 in East Moline At this interchange I80 turns easterly paralleling US 6 and leaving the Quad Cities area East of Quad Cities the interstate passes through rural farmland as a fourlane interstate The road passes south of Geneseo with the city having one interchange at IL 82 The road passes south of Atkinson before passing over US 6 and a railroad track

After crossing over the railroad tracks the interstate has an interchange with IL78 north of Annawan The interstate continues towards the east having a folded diamond interchange with IL40 before having rest areas on both sides of the roadway The highway passes on the north side of Princeton having an interchange with IL26 near a commercial part of the city I80 passes over US34 before leaving Princeton and having an interchange with the northern terminus of I180 The interstate has a rural interchange with IL89 before entering LaSalle In LaSalle the highway has a diamond interchange with 103 Road just north of the Illinois Valley Regional Airport The highway has an interchange with IL251 with commercial properties around the interchange I80 has an interchange with IL351 just south of the Mitchells Grove Nature Preserve before having an interchange with I39US51

After the interchange with I39 I80 leaves LaSalle heading towards the east passing through rural farmland Between 12th road and 14th Road the interstate passes the AASHO Road Test site one of old test loops used for testing different types of road surfaces in the 1950s The interstate enters Ottawa and has an interchange with IL23 near many commercial businesses After IL 23 the freeway leaves Ottawa and crosses over the Fox River before having an interchange with IL71 The road passes through rural farmland having a few rural interchanges before entering Morris In Morris the roadway curves toward the northeast having an interchange with IL47 near many commercial properties The highway leaves Morris passing through farmland having a rural interchange with a county road Both directions of I80 have a rest area before entering Minooka In Minooka the interstate curves the east before turning back towards the northeast and leaving the village The road enters Will County by curving towards the northeast The interstate curves towards the east before having an interchange with I55

After I55 I80 enters Joliet passing near many warehouses The road has an interchange with IL7 before passing near residential The road crosses over the Des Plaines River on the Des Plaines River Bridge After the river the freeway has an interchange with US52IL53 The interstate has an interchange with a city street before crossing over a railroad tracks After the railroad tracks the freeway has a diamond interchange with another city street The road has a folded diamond interchange with US30 before passing southeast of Potawatomi Woods County Forest Preserve While passing through the preserve the roadway becomes a sixlane interstate The interstate has an interchange with the southern terminus of the Veterans Memorial Tollway I355 The residential properties end and the highway passes through a more industrial area before passing through the Yankee Woods Cook County Forest Preserve

After the preserve the interstate has an interchange with I57 I80 joins the TriState Tollway I294 heading towards the east as a tenlane tollway The tollway passes over a rail yard before having an interchange with IL1 After IL1 the roadway narrows to eightlanes and passes through the Thornton Quarry The interstate passes under the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis before passing north of Wampum Lake After passing the lake the tollway has an interchange with I94 At this interchange with I94 the TriState Tollway and I294 both end with I94 running concurrent with I80 towards the east The concurrency between I80 and I94 travels on a freeway locally known as the Kingery Expressway The interstate has a singlepoint urban interchange SPUI with IL83 and the western end of US 6 concurrency East of US 6 exit the freeway become a tenlane interstate passing near residential properties The road enters Indiana and the freeway name becomes Borman Expressway

The IDOT operates 5 rest areas and ISHTA operates one Oasis in 163 miles of interstate highway Along I80 there are three locations that have facilities for each direction of traffic Parking areas are divided so passenger automobiles are separated from semi trucks Common among most of the rest stops are restrooms payphones with TTY capabilities weather information picnic areas and vending machines The eastbound rest area near Rapid City does not allow large trucks and doesnt have vending machines or TTY capabilities

The Oasis is the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis located in South Holland Like most of the other Oasis this location has several fast food restaurants gas stations convenience store visitors center and free wireless internet This Oasis is one of the few with an electric vehicle charging station The Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis was originally named Lincoln Oasis the ISHTA added Chicago Southland to the name The change was made to better represent the area around the Oasis The Oasis name was changed in February 2006 changing the name officially to the Chicago Southland Lincoln Oasis

In 1917 there were many sections of named highways which made up the route that current I80 takes through Illinois The first was the Blue Line It was routed between Rock Island and Princeton The second section was named Sunset Trail and it traveled between Princeton and Ottawa passing through LaSalle Illinois Valley Trail went from Ottawa to Orland Park From Orland Park to the Indiana state line no named highway was available The first state highways along the I80 corridor were numbered IL7 from the Rock Island east to the Orland Park area and IL53 from Orland Park east to Indiana state line in 1923 The United States Numbered Highway System was approved on November 11 1926 and US32 was routed between Rock Island and Princeton East of Princeton US32 followed a route closer to current US34 US6 was commissioned in Illinois in 1932 replacing US32 west of Princeton IL7 between Princeton and Joliet and IL53 from Joliet to the Indiana state line

Construction of a test track for the Interstate Highway System between Utica and Ottawa began in 1952 The test track had six different segments of roadway with different types of surfaces One of the old test tracks can still be seen from I80 The first section of I80 to open was the section that is known as the Kingery Expressway this section open in 1957 as US 6 In October 1958 the test track west of Ottawa opens to testing The section of I80 that is concurrent with the TriState Tollway was opened in 1958 November 1960 the testing at the test track is complete The interstate opened between IL 71 near Ottawa and I55 near Joliet in 1960 The segment of roadway between IL 23 and IL 71 near Ottawa open in 1961 In 1962 the highway was extended west to IL 89 near LaSalle replacing and paralleling the test track most of the way to Utica Also in 1962 another section of road open between US 67 and IL 78 During 1964 and 1965 the gap between IL 78 and IL 89 was completed and opened to traffic The northsouth section of I80 in Illinois was open in 1967 The last section of I80 to open was the section between I55 and the TriState Tollway with it opening 1968

In 1990 and 1991 IDOT proposed rerouting I80 onto present day I280 with current I80 becoming I74 IDOT listed safety concerns and cost savings as reasons to reroute I80 Iowa officials challenged the reroute of I80 and the routes of I74 and I80 never changed Between 1991 and 1992 the section of I80 that is concurrent with the TriState Tollway was reconstructed and widened to eightlanes Between 2003 and 2007 construction to widen the Kingery Expressway the project costed 460 Million This was the first major project on the Kingey Expressway since it was opened in the 1950s In early 2011 IDOT began construction to widen a section of freeway to sixlanes between US30 and US45 This project had an opening ceremony on October 24 2012 with the project costing 26million

Bentleigh Secondary College
Bentleigh Secondary College is a coeducational public high school in Bentleigh East Victoria Australia Established in 1956 it has been renamed several times before becoming Bentleigh Secondary College 

Bentleigh Secondary College has recently been redeveloped In stage one of the building program funded by the state government a new performing arts centre administration block and sports stadium were built The building that was previously the college library has been converted into a VCE centre A new science block was also completed in late 2008 following the demolition of what was previously Bblock and Cblock

The college is made up of eight main buildings

The college grounds include a sustainable garden a football oval and soccer pitches

Students learn Japanese and attend three periods of their elected language per week for Year 7 and 8 After Year 8 LOTE Japanese becomes an electives subject

The college has implemented a Gifted  Talented Program whereby students based on the results of a standardised test undertaken before entering high school of high potential to achieve are grouped into one class until the end of year nine In this case the class is 74 84 and 94 104 is renamed 10D which also contains the students from previous 4 classes and does Advanced English Advanced Maths and Advanced Science

Performing arts at Bentleigh Secondary College consists of music drama and dance With the option to study an instrument there are several welldeveloped school bands The Symphonic Wind Ensemble is the most senior of the bands made up of brass woodwind and percussion players This ensemble competed in the Advanced Concert Band section of the Melbourne School Bands festival for the first time in 2009 There is also a concert band Intermediate Band and Year 7 Concert Band There are Senior Intermediate and Junior Jazz Bands as well as senior rock band which perform at the annual Big Band Boogie and on concert nights In addition to these bands there are a dozen or so small ensembles such as brass ensemble and clarinet ensemble Also new this year is the college choir which is open for all students to join
Chicago A Musical Vaudeville is the Schools production for 2011
For each school Production the Music Department also organises a Production Band of students and staff to accompany the Actors

At approximately 300 am on 10 February 2008 two police officers saw smoke coming from the school and a car leaving this area The fire has caused more than 100000 in damage however the decision of the officers to proceed to the cause of the smoke rather than pursue the culprits prevented further destruction

In March 2017 two sisters who attend the college were ordered to remove their hairbraids or face consequences by school staff The sisters of South Sudanese descent pointed out that the braids were the healthiest and best way to manage their hair and refused to remove them The sisters accused the school of discrimination Media coverage and public outcry resulted from the incident due to the schools perceived lack of racial sensitivity and understanding

Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway
The Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway was a branchline railway built in Scotland connecting the named places with the main line at Spean Bridge It opened in 1903

Serving exceptionally sparsely inhabited areas it was never commercially successful but it rekindled hostilities between larger railways over a planned railway connection along the Great Glen reaching Inverness however this scheme never materialised

Passenger train operation ceased in 1933 and the line closed completely in 1946

The Great Glen is a faultcontrolled glacial valley that runs diagonally across the Highlands of Scotland from Fort William on Loch Linnhe in the south west to Inverness on the Moray Firth in the north east

It forms an easy communication route and as well as roads the Caledonian Canal was constructed along it by linking natural lochs with canal sections It opened to seagoing vessels in 1822 but the limited size of the canal sections proved inadequate for general merchant shipping

In the railway age Inverness was an important commercial centre and from 1854 it was the focus of railway communication and from a company amalgamation in 1865 the Highland Railway was dominant in that area Agriculture and industry was active in the eastern side of the country and railway development there was more vigorous By contrast the western side of the area was backward and depressed The first railway to attempt to reach the west coast was the Dingwall and Skye Railway authorised in 1865 to build from Dingwall north of Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh close to the Isle of Skye In fact the line opened only as far as Stromeferry on Loch Carron a more difficult anchorage than Kyle of Lochalsh in 1870 The Highland Railway later absorbed the Dingwall and Skye Railway and in 1897 it extended the line to Kyle of Lochalsh

An approach to the west coast further south was attempted by the Callander and Oban Railway by extending from an existing branch line from Dunblane at Callander Oban was already an important hub of communication with the islands and coastal towns The construction of this line was also difficult passing through rocky landscapes with a thin population density There were serious money problems but with the considerable support of the Caledonian Railway Oban was at last connected to the railway system in 1880

Widespread attention was given to the depressed economic conditions in the West Highlands and in the 1883 Parliamentary session the Glasgow and North Western Railway was proposed It was to leave the North British Railway at Maryhill on the north west margin of Glasgow and run by Loch Lomondside and Glencoe to Fort William and Inverness This was an ambitious scheme but the Highland Railway saw it as a threat to its supremacy in its area and it opposed the scheme vigorously the result was that the Glasgow and North Western Railway was rejected in Parliament

It was a more modest proposal that actually provided the third link to the western coast the West Highland Railway which built a line from Craigendoran opened in 1894 and extended to Banavie on the Caledonian Canal the following year The West Highland Railway had intended to build their line to Roshven in the Sound of Arisaig Major difficulties had arisen with landowners objections to the Roshven line and the West Highland Railway contented itself with extending instead to Mallaig from Fort William and that section opened in 1901

The West Highland Railway was sponsored by the North British Railway and hostility flared up between the NBR and the Highland Railway both companies proposed lines along the Great Glen in 1893 In fact both companies reviewed their intentions and withdrew their schemes and agreed not to promote further similar schemes for a period of ten years the socalled ten year truce

The contractor and entrepreneur Charles Forman had been active in encouraging the various Great Glen schemes and now he proposed the Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway it was to run to Fort Augustus from Spean Bridge on the West Highland Railway In 1896 the board of the company comprised 

The scheme attracted considerable local support and it obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 14 August 1896 The population of Fort Augustus was less than 500 and it was widely assumed that the line was a speculative bid to reach Inverness

Formans and McCall were appointed engineers of the railway and James Young of Glasgow was the contractor Construction started on 2 March 1897 when Mrs Eliza Stewart Ellice of Invergarry wife of Captain Ellice deputy chairman of the company cut the first turf but the process was very slow in part due to an exceptionally high standard of specification for the architectural and engineering assets Elaborate stations with spacious goods yards were provided Invergarry had four goods sidings and separate loading banks for cattle and goods

In April 1900 the directors paid a visit of inspection and travelled over the whole length of the line which was reported as practically completed

The line was 23 miles 13 chains in length to Fort Augustus station the Pier extension was 73 chains The first mile and last mile of the railway absorbed around one third of the capital expenditure From the west end of Spean Bridge the line passed along the banks of the River Spean and through a gorge which required four lattice spans at a maximum height above the river of  one of  two of and one of  After a stretch through wooded countryside it crossed the river Gloy on a threespan lattice girder bridge of two spans and one span The line then climbed to the summit of at Letterfinlay The descent to the Great Glen included the Oich tunnel and a fourspan Calder Burn viaduct to reach Aberchalder The final stretch followed the shoreline of Loch Uanagan to Fort Augustus town station From there it crossed the Caledonian Canal on a swing bridge to the pier station on Loch Ness The line had a ruling gradient of 1 in 66 and was single throughout although land had been acquired for double track there were passing loops at all the stations which were

The line had cost 344000  to construct or around 14300 per mile Michael Bass 1st Baron Burton had provided 163000 of the capital required for construction The line was ready for opening in 1901 but the company had run out of money and had none to purchase locomotives coaches and wagons The company approached the North British Railway to operate the line for them The Highland Railway objected to this and the matter was investigated by Parliamentary authorities This led to a lengthy delay in agreeing terms of operation The North British Railway required 60 of the revenue with a minimum of 3000 each year  The Highland Railway agreed to operate it at 2000 per half year The Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway company had to submit a private bill to parliament to confirm the working arrangement and this was passed on 30 June 1903

On 14 July 1903 Colonel John Wallace Pringle inspected the railway on behalf of the Board of Trade and declared it open for traffic The line opened to passengers on 22 July 1903 The formal ceremony was performed at Spean Bridge by Mrs Eliza Stewart Ellice of Invergarry who had cut the first turf in 1897 She was presented with a gold whistle A large party of invited guests travelled by train to Fort Augustus where they were entertained by William Whitelaw chairman of the Highland Railway Company to luncheon at the Lovat Arms Hotel

The company appointed Hugh Fraser as stationmaster at Fort Augustus James Morrison at Invergarry and Donald Macdonald to Gairlochy

The building of the line was the signal for a resumption of the fight for a railway along the Great Glen the IFAR itself as well as the Highland Railway and the North British Railway proposed lines linking to Inverness but the Highland gained the ascendency However it was excluded in the Commons from running powers over the IFAR and the Highland Bill was subsequently thrown out in the Lords
By the 32nd section of its Act of Incorporation the railway was for the benefit of the owners of the Glengarry estate required to construct a permanent station at within 2 furlongs of the SouthWest end of Loch Oich to be called Invergarry Station for passengers animals and goods with separate waitingrooms for ladies and gentlemen and other usual and necessary accommodation therein and to stop all ordinary trains other than express or special or excursion trains at such station daily for the purpose of taking up and setting down traffic of any kind

A 440 tank engine no 52 was generally used as the motive power during the Highland Railway period There were four trains each way daily In September 1905 King Edward VII travelled over the line from Spean Bridge to Invergarry with George Cadogan 5th Earl Cadogan and Countess Cadogan

The Fort Augustus Pier station was on Loch Ness and tourist traffic was contemplated However the dominant steamer operator on the loch David MacBrayne Ltd declined to use the railway pier and it saw very little use The extension to the pier involved a handoperated swing bridge over the Caledonian Canal and a viaduct over the River Oich Passenger traffic on the pier extension was suspended from 1 October 1906 although occasional goods trains ran until July 1924 when the extension was finally closed permanently

In March 1906 many areas of the western Highlands experienced exceptional rainfall and flooding Describing the dislocation to railways in the Lochaber area the Scotsman reported The most serious damage reported however occurred on the Invergarry and FortAugustus Railway in the neighbourhood of Letterfinlay where two large sections of the line have been washed away by the enormous rush of water down the hillside In consequence of this mishap no traffic occurred over the line on Saturday

The line was heavily lossmaking due to the sparse population and the availability of a direct alternative in the steamers on the parallel Caledonian Canal The Highland Railway decided to cut its losses confident that its supremacy at Inverness was no longer at risk It withdrew its trains from 1 May 1907

The abandonment of the Invergarry and FortAugustus Railway by the Highland Railway Company will surprise noone who knows the conditions under which that line is at present worked The railway ought really to be a branch and feeder of the West Highland Railway Beginning at Spean Bridge on the latter system it is laid through a beautiful but sparselypopulated country to FortAugustus midway between Inverness and FortWilliam For a considerable part of the way it runs alongside the chain of lochs forming the Caledonian Canal and is thus in direct competition to the steamboat traffic on the Canal FortAugustus is a small town of very inconsiderable importance except as a tourist centre and none of the other villages tapped by the line is large or busy

The North British Railway took over on 1 May 1907 there was a threeyear agreement to work the line for 60 of gross receipts with a minimum take of 2000 The NBR operated two trains each way daily but increased this to four in the summer

The North British Railway proposed to close the line down from 31 January 1911 but the wealthy sponsors of the IFAR persuaded them to persevere for one more summer which they did The financial situation did not improve and the NBR withdrew its trains from 31 October 1911

The line was now closed and for the time being it avoided the operating costs that led to the huge losses while the company contented itself with taking in small sums of nonrailway income A huge movement of public opinion now took place urging retention of the line notwithstanding the extremely low usage of it when it was operating A request for Government support was put forward though without success and for the time being the line remained closed

In 1912 the NBR offered to purchase the line for 22500  but the IFAR company refused the sale The company offered the railway for sale in December 1912 but were taken to the Court of Session by Lochaber District Committee Aird District Committee the trustee of Edward Ellice and Major Bailey of Invergarry on 5 February 1913 to prevent the assets being sold for scrap This was referred to the First Division of the Court of Session in March 1913 who found in favour of the complainants and prevented the railway from being sold

In 1913 Invernessshire County Council offered to contribute an additional 5000 and the sale was agreed at 27500 by an Act of 28 August 1914 the transfer was authorised by Parliament

The NBR resumed working the line on 1 August 1913 as contractors to the IFAR for the time being formal transfer to the North British Railway took place on 30 August 1914 There were three trains daily in summer and two in winter Through trains to and from Fort William were later operated

The railway suffered two landslides in 1916 which affected services badly At the end of January floods caused a landslide resulting in around 1000 tons of debris blocking several hundred yards of line just east of Invergarry station In October more heavy rain caused flooding which suspended traffic on the line

On 2 August 1924 another cloudburst caused a landslide a mile north of Invergarry and a train from Fort Augustus rain into the debris on the line and derailed

A writer for the Railway Magazine had a run on the line in 1940

Passenger and parcels traffic on the Fort Augustus branch was suspended in November 1933 and there is now only one weekly coal and petrol train leaving Spean Bridge at 1030 am on Saturdays all other traffic being dealt with by LNER motor lorries and David McBraynes buses and steamers the latter in summer only The locomotive working the branch is an exNorth British 060 goods No 9663 which runs out and home light from Fort William and makes up its train at Spean Bridge the latter usually consists of twelve to sixteen wagons and a brake The branch presents a rather neglected appearance for several sidings passing loops footbridges signal boxes and all signalling except for a fixed distant just outside Spean Bridge have been removed Leaving Spean Bridge I travelled in the brake having in addition to the guard a bicycle two passengers some newspapers three or four bags of coal and a large consignment of cakes as companions We stopped at Gairlochy the first station out where the guards wife is stationmistress and I was very interested to see the way in which all of the station buildings have been converted into a camping hostel similar to the camping coaches but with fireplaces telephone water laid on and Mrs Guard to minister to ones wants Similar arrangements have been made at Invergarry and Fort Augustus the charge averaging 2 to 3 per person per week

Leaving Gairlochy we passed Invergloy platform also two sidings put in for timber traffic during the 19141919 war and pulled up at Invergarry A stationmasterclerk is in charge here and a similar arrangement obtains at Fort Augustus A short distance ahead a tunnel is passed and speed rose to 35 or 40 mph Passing Aberchalder the station buildings of which are now let to a fruit merchant about 20 min journey brought us to Fort Augustus Here all the passenger tracks have been removed except a through line which ran down to the Pier station closed in 1907  mile further on a swingbridge over the Caledonian Canal and a viaduct still remain together with a few hundred yards of track but when the GlasgowInverness road was reconstructed in 19341936 part of an embankment of the pier extension was removed completely and the rails are thus severed The tworoad engine shed is derelict but the turntable is still in use by the engineers Department Ro Railer which comes up from Fort William occasionally About 1215 pm the train commences its return journey which has no stops save one at Gairlochy to pick up the guards dinner and Spean Bridge is reached about 130 pm Gairlochy Invergarry and Fort Augustus stations have recently been repainted and numbers of men were at work renovating several bridges a sleeping van was stationed at Aberchalder for them

Passenger trains continued until 1 December 1933 when the very poor patronage caused the London and North Eastern Railway LNER as successor to the North British Railway to close the service Weekly coal trains continued running until they were withdrawn and the line closed on 31 December 1946 The last train to run on the line was on 31 December 1946 with 18 wagons loaded with timber

After closure Fort Augustus station was occupied by a company constructing a hydro electric power scheme and on 30 October 1950 the station building was badly damaged by fire

Some of the line today has been built over by roads and holiday parks although it mostly survives in a reasonably good if overgrown condition The many bridges and single tunnel are in particularly good condition Some of the line along Loch Oich has been incorporated into the Great Glen Way and a further section is proposed to become part of National Cycle Route 78

A restoration project is 2016 under way at Invergarry Station the last remaining station that is largely intact The Invergarry Station Preservation Society plan to create a static museum with a short length of track and several freight wagons

In March 2015 480ft of track was laid in platform 1 Work then commenced in constructing the replica signal cabin on the platform The project is now known as the Invergarry  Fort Augustus Railway Museum The track has been extended a quarter of a mile to the west and in 2019 a spur will cross the cycle track giving access to the sidings

Incipient wetness impregnation
Incipient wetness impregnation IW or IWI also called capillary impregnation or dry impregnation is a commonly used technique for the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts Typically the active metal precursor is dissolved in an aqueous or organic solution Then the metalcontaining solution is added to a catalyst support containing the same pore volume as the volume of the solution that was added Capillary action draws the solution into the pores Solution added in excess of the support pore volume causes the solution transport to change from a capillary action process to a diffusion process which is much slower The catalyst can then be dried and calcined to drive off the volatile components within the solution depositing the metal on the catalyst surface The maximum loading is limited by the solubility of the precursor in the solution The concentration profile of the impregnated compound depends on the mass transfer conditions within the pores during impregnation and drying

The SACC headquarters at Khotso House in Johannesburg were destroyed by a bomb on August 31 1988 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission later found that State President PW Botha had personally ordered the bombing Former Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok and several senior policemen applied for and were granted amnesty for the bombing The bombing party was directed by Eugene de Kock then commander at Vlakplaas a secret facility of the security branch of the South African Police force

During the antiapartheid struggle the SACC was in alliance with liberation movements such as the African National Congress ANC In recent times there have been claims that the ANC has marginalised the Council in favour of Pastor Ray McCauleys National Interfaith Leadership Council which the SACC was excluded from and that there are also tensions between the two organisations The SACC has also been extremely critical of the ANC for its role in the September 2009 militia attacks on Kennedy Road informal settlement calling for an independent investigation into police inaction and the release of community leaders associated with Abahlali baseMjondolo and the Kennedy Road Development Committee

Hans Merensky
Hans Merensky 16 March 1871 in Botshabelo  21 October 1952 on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof was a South African geologist prospector scientist conservationist and philanthropist He discovered the rich deposit of alluvial diamonds at Alexander Bay in Namaqualand vast platinum and chrome reefs at Lydenburg Rustenburg and Potgietersrus which led to some of the largest platinum mines in the world phosphates and copper at Phalaborwa in the Transvaal lowveld gold in the Free State and the worlds biggest chrome deposit at Jagdlust near Pietersburg

Hans Merensky was born on 16 March 1871 at Berlin Missionary Society station Botshabelo near Middelburg in Transvaal where his father Alexander Merensky 18371918 a noted ethnographer and author was the resident missionary Keenly interested in minerals and enjoying outdoor living he studied mining geology after finishing his schooling in Germany He was awarded a doctorate in mining geology from the University of Charlottenburg in Berlin He completed his practical training in coal mines in the Saarland and in Silesia and began work for the Department of Mines in East Prussia In 1904 he came to South Africa to conduct some geological surveys in the Transvaal He discovered tin near Pretoria and reported to the Premier Diamond Mine regarding possible mining prospects He worked for several mining companies and Friedlaender  Co sent him to Madagascar to investigate a reported discovery of gold which turned out to be false He resigned from his job in Germany and moved to Johannesburg where he became a successful consulting geologist

In 1909 he visited the diamond fields of South West Africa and controversially predicted that diamonds would be found along the West coast and south of the Orange River In 1913 Merensky lost his entire fortune due to the Depression and was interned at a camp near Pietermaritzburg During these financially difficult years he enjoyed the support of Sir George Albu

In 1924 he followed up the discovery of alluvial platinum by A F Lombard on his farm in Lydenburg and discovered its source in the Bushveld Igneous Complex which set him on the road to financial recovery This deposit came eventually to be known as the Merensky Reef which contains 75 per cent of the worlds known platinum resources

In 1926 diamonds were found at Alexander Bay and Merensky received 1250000 for his prospectors share He established the Phosphate Development Corporation Ltd  FOSKOR  to manage the extraction of phosphates at Phalaborwa

In his final years he lived unostentatiously on his farm Westfalia near Duiwelskloof in Transvaal where he received local celebrities and foreign dignitaries He died on 21 October 1952
Merensky allotted the larger part of his fortune to the Hans Merensky Trust to ensure that his projects in agriculture horticulture and forestry operations on the Westphalia Estate would be continued after his death He established the Hans Merensky Library at the University of Pretoria

In 2004 Martin Enlen directed a German language movie called Platinum based on Hans Merenskys life Both overdubbed and subtitled English versions of this movie exist

The Hans Merensky Wilderness a protected area in Limpopo and Merensky High School an agricultural and academic public school on a farm near Tzaneen are named after him

Victoria Park Western Australia
Victoria Park is an inner south eastern suburb of Perth Western Australia Its local government area is the Town of Victoria Park

Victoria Park is the eastern gateway to Perths central business district being the intersection of the three original eastern arterial roads Albany Highway Canning Highway Great Eastern Highway and the Causeway Bridge The Causeway connects Victoria Park to the city located 3km to the northwest

The suburb of Victoria Park derives its name from Victoria Park Estate a development that took place there in the 1890s It is believed the name was given to the estate because Queen Victoria was still on the throne although it may be connected with Victoria Park in Melbourne

The area was originally the largest portion of a grant of to John Butler in 1831 Progress and development was initially very slow but a few houses were built around coach stops on the Albany Road initially constructed from handsawn wooden logs The road was rebuilt in the early 1860s by convicts At this time the entire area from Canning Bridge to Belmont was simply known as Canning

In 1886 a settlement started at 2 Mile Spring opposite the present location of the Broken Hill Hotel and a year later subdivision commenced The building of the railway to Pinjarra in 1893 had a huge effect on the area  within a few years a state school was built on Cargill Street and by 1898 the population had reached 1197

The following year Broken Hill Hotel and the Town Hall were constructed serving as both a community centre and as the council office for the Victoria Park Municipality until amalgamation with the City of Perth in 1917 The Town Hall was later demolished while the Broken Hill Hotel is listed by the National Trust

A tram service commenced in 1905 and by 1917 the population had reached 5000 and had at their disposal electric lighting a public library 1903 police station 1906 post office 1912 bowling club 1913 and two hotels as well as several banks and numerous commercial enterprises and factories After World War I Albany Highway was bitumenised and the commercial centre on either side of the road grew to rival centres in more established areas

While by 1937 considered a working mans district by the mid1970s the area had a higherthanaverage elderly population according to ABS statistics and the development of townhouses in place of some of the original dwellings saw increasing gentrification as city workers settled in areas closer to the Perth CBD In 1993 Burswood was approved as a name for the northeastern part of Victoria Park and split away from it

The Causeway Bridge was the first major bridge engineering project in or about Perth and involved augmenting the Heirisson mudflats into a proper island The mudflats were at that time an important resource for the Noongar Indigenous Australians The current bridge is the third edition

Victoria Park is bounded by the Swan River to the northwest Shepperton Road Harper Street and the Armadale railway to the northeast Miller and Kent Streets to the southeast and a line 61 m southwest of Berwick Street to the southwest The suburb is mostly residential although Albany Highway is a commercial high street and a number of parks can be found  most notably McCallum Park on the river Raphael Park and the smaller Read Park and Hawthorne Park

At the ABS 2001 census Victoria Park had a population of 6980 people living in 3998 dwellings Over a quarter of Victoria Parks residents live in unit or apartment blocks The ABS identified property and business services and retail as the primary occupations followed by health manufacturing hospitality and education 152 of those surveyed were from East or SouthEast Asia while sizable Italian and South Asian minorities were reported

Victoria Park is a major transit route being the intersection point of the Canning Highway to South Perth Applecross and Fremantle the Great Eastern Highway to Belmont and Perth Airport the Albany Highway to Cannington and Armadale and The Causeway to Perths CBD Albany Highway runs through the suburb as a main shopping street

Victoria Park is served by the Victoria Park train station on its northeastern corner and by the Victoria Park bus station on the eastern end of The Causeway All services are operated by the Public Transport Authority

Victoria Parks only booth Homestead Seniors Centre is marginal at federal level and supports the Australian Labor Party at state elections Nearby booths in East Victoria Park consistently support the Australian Labor Party at both levels of government

Meir ben Ezekiel ibn Gabbai
Meir ben Ezekiel ibn Gabbai  was a Kabbalist born in Spain toward the end of 1480 and living probably in the East

He complained in his twentyseventh year that he had to work hard to support himself and his family see end of Tolaat Yaaob He was an enthusiastic cabalist noted for thorough mastery of the whole cabalistic lore the most important points of which he as far as can be judged now was the first of his generation to treat systematically He must be regarded therefore as the precursor of Moshe Cordovero and Isaac Luria His first work completed in 1507 and held in high regard was Tolaat Yaaob a cabalistic exposition of the prayer ritual His chief work which he finished December 22 1531 after having spent eight years on it was Avodat Hakodesh in which he expounds in detail his cabalistic system making a close study of Maimonides in order the better to refute him In 1539 he wrote an exposition and defense of the Sefirot under the title Derek Emunah in answer to his pupil Joseph haLevi who had questioned him in regard to his doctrine of the Sefirot Gabbai basing his work on Azriel of Geronas Perush Eser Sefirot

Gabbai regarded the Zohar as the canonical book of the Kabbala His system is tinged with panentheism God Himself as the first cause of all causes can neither be conceived nor cognized and can not even be mentioned the name En Sof Infinite is a mere makeshift Even the Keter Elyon the first Sefirah can not be conceived or imagined it is coeternal with the En Sof although only its effect it is what is called in Scripture His Name By means of it the other sefirot emanated from God being the various manifestations through which the Godhead makes Himself cognizable To them the prayers are addressed and they are intended in the different designations of God whose relation to them is the same as that of the soul to the body

The other emanations are the seven hekalot which proceed from the sefirot and represent in a way the feminine world as contrasted with the masculine world of the sefirot they are the real vessels of the further development of the world This emanation of the world from God constitutes the glory of God The consciousness of dependence on God with the striving toward Him in order to be united and become one with Him and thereby to acknowledge His unity and effect its realization is the yiud the conscious union with God which is the final aim of the world Man a reflection of the highest hekal unites in his soul the rays of all the sefirot and in himself in general as microcosm all the basic elements of being His soul therefore is in connection with the upper world which it is able to influence and stimulate by its actions and aspirations for everything that happens in this world reaches in wavelike circles to the uppermost regions By recognizing and fulfilling the religious and moral precepts man advances the harmony and union of the various grades of creatures and succeeds in performing his task in lifethe bringing about of the yiud

Gabbais son ayyim was also a cabalist and his soninlaw Senior ben Judah Falcon published Gabbais first two books after his death the Tolaat Yaaob with the aid of Abraham Reyna at Constantinople in 1560 and Avodat Hakodesh at Venice in 1567

Claude Nicolas Ledoux
ClaudeNicolas Ledoux 21 March 1736  18 November 1806 was one of the earliest exponents of French Neoclassical architecture He used his knowledge of architectural theory to design not only domestic architecture but also town planning as a consequence of his visionary plan for the Ideal City of Chaux he became known as a utopian His greatest works were funded by the French monarchy and came to be perceived as symbols of the Ancien Rgime rather than Utopia The French Revolution hampered his career much of his work was destroyed in the nineteenth century In 1804 he published a collection of his designs under the title LArchitecture considre sous le rapport de lart des murs et de la lgislation Architecture considered in relation to art morals and legislation In this book he took the opportunity of revising his earlier designs making them more rigorously neoclassical and up to date This revision has distorted an accurate assessment of his role in the evolution of Neoclassical architecture His most ambitious work was the uncompleted Royal Saltworks at ArcetSenans an idealistic and visionary town showing many examples of architecture parlante Conversely his works and commissions also included the more mundane and everyday architecture such as approximately sixty elaborate tollgates around Paris in the Wall of the General Tax Farm

Ledoux was born in 1736 in DormanssurMarne the son of a modest merchant from Champagne At an early age his mother Francoise Domino and godmother Francoise Piloy encouraged him to develop his drawing skills Later the Abbey of Sassenage funded his studies in Paris 17491753 at the Collge de Beauvais where he followed a course in Classics On leaving the Collge age 17 he took employment as an engraver but four years later he began to study architecture under the tutelage of JacquesFranois Blondel for whom he maintained a lifelong respect

He then trained under Pierre Contant dIvry and also made the acquaintance of JeanMichel Chevotet These two eminent Parisian architects designed in both the restrained French Rococo manner known as the Louis XV style and in the Got grec literally Greek taste phase of early Neoclassicism However under the tutelage of Contant dIvry and Chevotet Ledoux was also introduced to Classical architecture in particular the temples of Paestum which along with the works of Palladio were to influence him greatly

The two master architects introduced Ledoux to their affluent clientele One of Ledouxs first patrons was the Baron Crozat de Thiers an immensely wealthy connoisseur who commissioned him to remodel part of his palatial town house in the Place Vendme Another client obtained through the auspices of his teachers was Prsident Hocquart de Montfermeil and his sister Mme de Montesquiou

In 1762 the young Ledoux was commissioned to redecorate the Caf Godeau in the rue SaintHonor The result was an interior of trompe loeil and mirrors Pilasters painted on the walls were interspersed with alternating Pier glasses and panels painted with trophies of helmets and weaponry all executed in bold detail In 1969 this interior was moved to the Muse Carnavalet

The following year the Marquis de MontesquiouFzensac commissioned Ledoux to redesign the old hilltop chteau on his estate at Mauperthuis Ledoux rebuilt the chteau and created new gardens replete with fountains supplied by an aqueduct In addition in the gardens and park he built an orangery a pheasantry and vast dpendances of which little remains today

In 1764 he designed for Prsident Hocquart a Palladian house on the Chausse dAntin using the colossal order Ledoux would frequently employ this motif that was condemned by the strict French tradition which embraced the principle of superimposing the classic column motifs on each floor rising from simplest to the most complex Tuscan Doric Ionic Corinthian etc

On 26 July 1764 in the SaintEustache Church Paris Ledoux married Marie Bureau the daughter of a court musician A friend from Champagne Joseph Marin Masson de Courcelles found him a position as the architect for the Water and Forestry Department Here between 1764 and 1770 he worked on the renovation and designs of churches bridges wells fountains and schools in Tonnerrois Snonais and Bassigny

Among the still extant works from this period are the bridge of Marac the Prgibert bridge in Rolampont the churches of FouventleHaut RocheetRaucourt Rolampont the nave and portal of CruzyleChtel and the quire of SaintEtienne dAuxerre

In 1766 Ledoux began designing the Htel dHallwyll Le Marais Paris a building that according to the Dijon architect Jacques Cellerier received widespread praise and attracted new patrons to the architect The owner FranzJoseph dHallwyll a Swiss colonel and his wife MarieThrse Demidorge were anxious to ensure work was executed economically Therefore Ledoux had to reuse portions of the existing buildings the former Htel de Bouligneux He had envisaged two colonnades in the Doric order leading to a nymphaeum decorated with urns at the foot of the garden However the limitations of the site made this impossible so Ledoux resorted to trompe loeil painting a colonnade on the blind wall of the neighboring convent thus extending the perspective

The recognition given to the relatively modest Htel dHallwyll led in 1767 to a more prestigious commission the Htel dUzs for Franois Emmanuel de Crussol on the rue Montmartre There too Ledoux preserved the structure of an earlier building Today the panelling from the salon an early example of the neoclassical style largely carved by Joseph Mtivier and JeanBaptist Boiston to the designs of Ledoux is preserved in the Carnavalet Museum Paris

Ledoux designed the Chteau de Bnouville in Calvados 17681769 for the Marquis de Livry With its simple almost severe facade of four stories broken by a prostyle portico the Chteau de Bnouville while not one of Ledouxs most inventive plans is notable for the unusual placement of the main staircase at the center of the garden facade a position normally taken by the main salon

Ledoux travelled to England in the years 17691771 There he became familiar with the Palladian style of architecture Palladio an influential Renaissance architect was famous for his Italian villas eg the Villa Rotunda From this point Ledoux worked often in the Palladian style usually employing a cubic design broken by a prostyle portico which gave an air of importance even to a small structure In this genre he built in 1770 a house for Marie Madeleine Guimard in the Chausse dAntin and following that commission the house of Mlle SaintGermain in the Rue SaintLazare the house of Attilly in the suburb of Poissonnire a house for the poet Jean Franois de SaintLambert in Eaubonne and most notably the Music Pavilion constructed between 1770 and 1771 at the Chteau de Louveciennes for the Kings mistress Madame du Barry whose patronage and influence were to be of use to Ledoux in later years

His reputation established Ledoux commenced a period of yet more ambitious designs The Htel de Montmorency on the Chausse dAntin dates from this period It has a principal faade in the Ionic order above a rustic ground floor Statues of illustrious members of the Montmorency family decorate the roof However the depletion of the Montmorency fortune meant that Ledoux was required to execute the project with some parsimony

Ledoux was interested in the work of the Royal Administrations Department and at times considered working for them even though the positions they offered were often on the borderline between architect and engineer Through this interest in civic and municipal architecture and due in no small part to the notorious influence of Madame du Barry Ledoux was commissioned with the modernization of the Salines de lEst Eastern Saltworks The modernization was initiated following the construction of the Burgundy Canal In 1771 Ledoux was promoted to Inspector of the saltworks in FrancheComt a title he held until 1790 with the position yielding him an annual salary of 6000 livres

In the 18th century salt was an essential and valuable commodity The unpopular salt tax known as the gabelle was collected by the Ferme Gnrale Salt served as a valuable source of income for the French king In FrancheComt due to subterranean seams of halite salt was extracted from saline wells by vaporizing in woodfuelled furnaces

In SalinslesBains or in Montmorot the saltworks boilers were built close to the wells and the wood was brought from the adjacent forests Contrary to what the French government wanted Ledoux placed the saltworks near the woods as opposed to the source of the salt water He logically reasoned that it would be easier to transport water than wood Close to the first of these sites the Fermiers Gnraux decided to explore a more mechanized and efficient method of extraction by constructing a purposebuilt factory near the forest of Chaux in the Val dAmour The saline water was to be brought to the factory by a newly constructed canal

The design which received royal approval of the Royal Saltworks at ArcetSenans or Salines de Chaux is considered Ledouxs masterpiece The initial building work was conceived as the first phase of a large and grandiose scheme for a new ideal city The first and as things were to turn out only stage of building was constructed between 1775 and 1778 Entrance is through a massive Doric portico inspired by the temples at Paestum The alliance of the columns is an archetypal motif of neoclassicism Inside a cavernous hall gives the impression of entering an actual salt mine decorated with concrete ornamentation representing the elementary forces of nature and the organizing genius of Man a reflection of the views of the relationship between civilization and nature endorsed by such eighteenthcentury philosophers as JeanJacques Rousseau

The entrance building opens into a vast semicircular open air space that is surrounded by ten buildings which are arranged on the arc of a semicircle On the arc is the coopers forge the forging mill and two bothies for the workers On the straight diameter are the workshops for the extraction of salt alternating with administrative buildings At the centre is the house of the director illustrated which originally also contained a chapel

The significance of this plan is twofold the circle a perfect figure evokes the harmony of the ideal city and theoretically encloses a place of harmony for common work but it recalls also contemporary theories of organization and of official surveillance particularly the Panopticon of Jeremy Bentham 

The saltworks entered a painful phase of industrial production and marginal profit because of competition with the saltwater marshes After some not very profitable trials it closed indefinitely in 1790 during the national instability caused by the French Revolution Thus the dream of success for a factory conceived at the same time as a royal residence and a new city ended

For a brief period in the 1920s the salt works were reused but eventually closed due to competition For the following decades the salt works lay in decay until they were named a UNESCO world heritage site and refurbished as a local cultural center

In 1784 Ledoux was the architect selected to design a theatre at Besanon FrancheComt The exterior of the building was designed as a severe Palladian cube adorned only by an almost Grecian neoclassical portico of six Ionic columns However if the neoclassical hints to the exterior was regarded as modern then the interior was a revolution venues for public entertainment were rare in the French provinces and where they did exist it was traditional that only the nobles had seating while those of less exulted rank had stood Ledoux realizing this was not only inconvenient but elitist planned the theatre at Besanon on more egalitarian lines with seating for all but in some quarters such a plan was seen as radical if not revolutionary the aristocracy had no wish to be seated alongside commoners However Ledoux found an ally in the Intendant of FrancheComt Charles Andr de la Cor an enlightened man he consented to follow this reforming plan Even so it was decided that the social classes would still be segregated thus while the theatre of was the first to have a ground floor amphitheatre furnished with seats for the ordinary paying public Above them was a raised terrace or balcony for state employers Directly above was the first tier of boxes reserved for the aristocracy and above this a tier of smaller boxes occupied by the middleclass the second Thus Ledoux achieved his ambition that the theatre could at the same time be a place of social communion and shared entertainment while still maintaining a strict hierarchy of the classes

The seating was not the only innovation at the theatre With the aid of the machinist Dart de Bosco Ledoux expanded the wings and back stage scenery apparatus giving it greater depth than was customary and many other modern improvements Besanon was the first theatre to screen the musicians in an orchestra pit The building was widely acclaimed on its opening in 1784 but when Ledoux submitted plans for the proposed new theatre in Marseilles but they were not accepted

In 1784 Ledoux was chosen over PierreAdrien Pris for the construction of the new town hall in Neufchtel This was followed by the spectacular project that he conceived for the Palais de Justice and the prison of AixenProvence This project however was to be beset by many difficulties Trouble began in 1789 when construction was interrupted by the French Revolution when only the ground floor walls had been completed 

Ledoux was a Freemason Ledoux took part with his friend William Beckford in various masonic ceremonies at the Loge Fminine de la Candeur which met in the town house he had built for Mme dEspinchal on the Rue des Petitescuries

He was well acquitted with the world of finance and those who inhabited it He designed a large house and park for Praudeau de Chemilly the treasurer of the Marchausses at Bourneville near FertMilon One of his more notable town houses was for the widow of the Genevan banker Thlusson This classical mansion a venue for Parisian high society was situated at the heart of a large landscaped garden accessed from the Rue de Provence The house had an immense portecochere in the form of a pillared triumphal arch The circular central salon had at its centre a colonnade which supported the ceiling

On the Rue SaintGeorges for the creole Hosten Ledoux designed an ensemble of tenements for rental designed in such a way they could in future be extended ad infinitum In the Rue SaintLazare around a commercial warehouse he designed the gardens of Zephyr and Flora which were illustrated by Hubert Robert

In the process of his work in FrancheComt Ledoux had become an architect for the ferme gnrale for whom he built a salt storehouse in Compigne and undertook to plan their vast headquarters on the rue du Bouloi in Paris

Charles Alexandre de Calonne the ControllerGeneral of Finances obtained on an idea from the chemist and fermier gnral Antoine Lavoisier of drawing a barrier around Paris to limit contraband and evasion of the octrois or internal customs duties this notorious Wall of the FarmersGeneral was to have six towers one every 4 kilometers and to comprise sixty taxcollecting offices Ledoux was charged to design these buildings which he baptized pompously les Propyles de Paris and to which he wanted to give a character of solemnity and magnificence while putting into practice his ideas on the necessary links between form and function

To cut short the protests of the Parisian population the operation was carried out rapidly fifty barriers to access were built between 1785 and 1788 Most were destroyed in the nineteenth century and very few remain today of which those of La Villette and Place DenfertRochereau are the only ones that havent been altered beyond recognition In certain cases the entry was framed with two identical buildings in others it consisted of a single building The forms were archetypal the rotunda Heap Reuilly the rotunda surmounting a Greek cross La Villette Rape the cube with peristyle Picpus the Greek temple Gentilly Courcelles the column le Trne At Place de ltoile the buildings flanked with columns alternating with cubic and cylindrical elements evoked the House of the director at ArcandSenans at the Bureau des Bonshommes an apse opened by a peristyle recalled the pavilion of Madame du Barry and the Htel de la Guimard The order employed was generally Doric Greek Ledoux also used multiple rustic embossings

This audacious construction met with political criticism as well as aesthetic criticism of the architect accused by commentators such as Dulaure and Quatremre de Quincy of taking excessive freedoms with the ancient canons Bachaumont denounced a monument desclavage et de despotisme a monument to enslavement and despotism In his Tableau de Paris 1783 LouisSbastien Mercier stigmatised les antres du fisc mtamorphoss en palais  colonnes the bastions of taxation metamorphosed into columned palaces and exclamed Ah Monsieur Ledoux vous tes un terrible architecteAh Monsieur Ledoux you are a terrible architect Ledoux rendered the object of scandal by these opinions was relieved of his official functions in 1787 while Jacques Necker succeeding Calonne disavowed the entire enterprise

At the same time work on the law courts of AixenProvence was suspended and Ledoux was accused of embroiling the Treasury in illconsidered expenditure When the Revolution broke out his rich clientele emigrated or perished under the guillotine He saw his career and his projects stopped while at the same time the first blows of the pickaxe began to ring on the already obsolete wall of the fermiers gnraux As of June 1790 the Ferme gnrale had been able to install its employees in the buildings by Ledoux but the octroi granting was abolished in May 1791 which rendered the facilities useless A symbol of fiscal oppression Ledoux who had amassed a handsome fortune was arrested and thrown in La Force Prison

He still made a project for a school of agriculture for the duc de Duras his companion in captivity Perhaps the intervention of the painter JacquesLouis David soninlaw of the entrepreneur Pcoul and considerably enriched in the collection of the octrois helped him avoid the guillotine But he lost his favourite daughter whilst the other brought a lawsuit against him

Ledoux who was eventually released ceased building and attempted to prepare the publication of his complete uvre Since 1773 he had started to engrave his constructions and his projects but because of the evolution of his style he did not cease retouching his drawings and the engravers constantly had to redo their boards Ledoux evolved towards an architecture always more detailed and colossal with vast walls that were increasingly smooth and with increasingly rare openings The differences between a drawing of the Pavillon de Louveciennes as it first was made by the British architect Sir William Chambers and the engraving that was published in 1804 illustrate this process

During his imprisonment Ledoux had started to write a text to accompany the engravings Only the first volume appeared during his lifetime in 1804 under the title LArchitecture considre sous le rapport de lart des murs et de la lgislationArchitecture considered under the relation of art and legislation It presented the theatre of Besanon the saltworks of ArcandSenans and the town of Chaux

He died in Paris in 1806

Around the time of the royal saltworks Ledoux formalized his innovative design ideas for an urbanism and an architecture intended to improve society of a Cit idale charged with symbols and meanings Along with tienneLouis Boulle and his project for the Cenotaph of Newton he is considered a precursor to the utopians who would follow Boulle and Ledoux were a specific influence on subsequent Greek Revival architects and especially Benjamin Henry Latrobe who carried through the style in the United States for public architecture with the intention that the spirit of the ancient Athenian democracy would be echoed by buildings serving the new democracy of the United States of America

After 1775 he presented Turgot with the first sketches of the town of Chaux centered on the royal saltworks The project constantly perfected but never executed was engraved beginning in 1780 The engravings announced in 1784 and probably all designed by 1799 were finally published in 1804 as part of the first edition of his LArchitecture considere

As a radical utopian of architecture teaching at the cole des BeauxArts he created a singular architectonic order a new column formed of alternating cylindrical and cubic stones superimposed for their plastic effect In this period taste was returning to the antique to the distinction and the examination of the taste for the rustic style


Some of his other visionary designs

In 1804 was published a volume including the works from 1768 to 1789  LArchitecture considre sous le rapport de lart des murs et de la lgislation

Battle of Seattle 1856
The Battle of Seattle was a January 26 1856 attack by Native Americans upon Seattle Washington At the time Seattle was a settlement in the Washington Territory that had recently named itself after Chief Seattle Sealth a leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish peoples of central Puget Sound

EuropeanAmerican settlers were backed by artillery fire and supported by Marines from the United States Navy sloopofwar Decatur anchored in Elliott Bay Seattles harbor then called Duwamsh Bay They suffered two fatalities It is not known if any of the Native American raiders died The contemporary historian T S Phelps wrote that they later would admit to 28 dead and 80 wounded The battle part of the multiyear Puget Sound War or Yakima Wars 18551858 lasted a single day

The Seattle settlement of the time was located roughly in the area of Seattles Pioneer Square and its neighborhood T S Phelpss memoir of the time described the settlement as
on a point or rather a small peninsula projecting from the eastern shore and about two miles 3 km from the mouth of Duwamsh River debouching at the head of the bay The northern part of this peninsula is connected with the mainland by a low neck of marshy ground and about onesixteenth of a mile from its southeastern extremity a firm hard sandpit nearly joined it to the adjacent shore severed only by a narrow channel through which the surplus waters of an inclosed swamp escaped into the bay The south and west sides rose abruptly from the beach forming an embankment from three to fifteen feet high and proceeding thence northerly the ground undulated for an eighth of a mile when it gradually sloped towards the swamp and neck

At the intersection of the latter with the main and overlooking the water rose a mound about thirty feet above the level of the bay and to the eastward through a depression in the hills and passing the head of the swamp was a broad Indian trail leading to Lake Duwamsh now Lake Washingtonnowikinowiki distant two and a half miles

Phelps remarks that the tailings from Henry Yeslers recently erected mill were steadily filling in the marshy land at the north of the head or peninsula where the settlement was located He described the arrangement of the troops arrayed in defense on the nights before the battle

The divisions nightly occupied the shore vigilantly guarding the people as they slept and resting only when the morning light released them from the apprehended attack  They were distributed along the line of defense in the following order The fourth under Lieutenant Dallas commencing at Southeast Point extended along the bay shore to the sandbar where meeting with the right of the first division Lieutenant Drake the latter continued the line facing the swamp to a point halfway from the bar to a hotel situated midway between the bar and Yeslers place and there joined the second under Lieutenant Hughes whose left resting on the hotel see Mother Damnable completed an unbroken line between the latter and Southeast Point while the howitzers crew Lieutenant Morris was stationed near Plummers house to sweep the bar and to operate wherever circumstances demanded The third division Lieutenant Phelps occupied that portion of the neck lying between the swamp and mound east of Yeslers place to secure the approaches leading from the lake and the marines under Sergeant Carbine garrisoned the blockhouse

The divisions thus stationed left a gap between the second and third which the width and impassable nature of the swamp at this place rendered unnecessary to close thereby enabling a portion of the town to be encompassed which otherwise would have been exposed

The distance between the blockhouse and Southeast Point following the sinuosities of the bay and swamp shores was threequarters of a mile to be defended by ninetysix men eighteen marines and five officers leaving Gunner Stocking Carpenter Miller Clerks Francis and Ferguson and fifteen men with Lieutenant Middleton to guard the ship

Washington Territory Governor Isaac Ingalls Stevens ambitious treatymaking during 1854 and 1855 has been held to be the cause of the Puget Sound War The battle was part of a Native American uprising in resistance to the pressure to cede land for reservations determined by territorial officials There had been a series of skirmishes in the region over the previous several months beginning October 28 1855 There had been fighting between federal troops and natives in southern King Thurston and Pierce counties Five days before the attack on Seattle Governor Stevens had declared a war of extermination upon the Indians

The sloop Decatur had been called to Puget Sound both because of the trouble with local natives and to deter frequent raids by an alliance of the northern Haida from the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Tongass group of the Tlingit from what was then Russian America Captained by Isaac L Sterret the vessel struck an uncharted reef near Bainbridge Island on December 7 1855 and was heavily damaged According to naval custom the reef was named Decatur Reef They limped into Seattle for repairs which lasted until January 19 Sterret was temporarily taken off active duty December 10 although later returned to active duty However on the day of the battle Decatur was commanded by Guert Gansevoort

Decatur lay at anchor in deep water in a position from which it had total command of the settlement with 16 shipborne 32pounders firing fuzed shells To the defense on land the ship contributed two ninepounder cannon and 18 stands of arms

About this time the raiders were attacking the White River settlers to the southeast Survivors fled to Seattle There they joined the fifty or so Seattle settlers Assisted by marines from the Decatur they had constructed a blockhouse from lumber originally intended for shipment to San Francisco

Days before the battle January 21 Territorial Governor Stevens arrived in Seattle aboard USS Active and discounted rumors of war Almost immediately upon his departure reports from friendly natives warned that the governor had been completely mistaken and that an attack was imminent These reports have been variously credited to Chief Seattle his daughter Princess Angeline or another chief Sucquardle known also as Curley or Curly Jim

David Swinson Doc Maynard reputed to have had far more than the usual concern for the natives rights and wellbeing evacuated 434 friendly natives to the west side of Puget Sound at his own expense and with the assistance of his wife

To some extent the settlers had organized for their defense as volunteers under a Captain Hewett However this company of volunteers had disbanded and reformed several times over the months leading up to the battle On the evening of January 22 with Decatur having taken a commanding position the militia leaders declared that they would not serve longer while there was a ship in port to protect them Phelps writes that a more reckless undisciplined set of men has seldom been let loose to prey upon any community than these eighty embryo soldiers upon Seattle after much rough argument about thirty of their number became partially convinced that their individual safety depended upon unity of action under a competent leader and they finally consented to form a company provided Mr Peixotto would consent to serve as captain That gentleman accepted the honor

Emily Denny mentions the company as being captained by Hewitt and including William Gilliam as 1st Lieutenant DT Denny as Corporal and Robert Olliver as Sergeant Phelps names both Hewitt and Peixotto as captains

Phelps lists the hostile natives as including the Kliktat Klickitat and Spokane Palouse Palus WallaWalla Yakami Yakama Kamialk Nisqually Puyallup Lake Duwamishrelated living near Lake Washington and other tribes estimated at six thousand warriors marshaled under the three generalsinchief Coquilton Owhi and Lushi assisted by many subordinate chiefs They had failed to recruit warriors from any of the several tribes or nations from the Olympic Peninsula nor did they succeed in winning the Snoqualmie over to their cause Although the Snoqualmie chief Patkanim was strongly opposed to the EuropeanAmerican settlers he allied with them in this war

Two hostile chiefsPhelps says Owhi and Lushi presumably Leschi other sources say Owhi and Coquiltondisguised themselves as friendly Indians and reconnoitered the situation the night before the battle Phelps describes this in some detail he was the sentry whom they tricked with a plausible story

According to Phelps account at least two native chiefs were playing a double game Curley Jim had been considered friendly enough by the settlers to be allowed to remain within their encampment conversely his nephew Yarkekeeman had been considered one of the hostile force According to Phelps the nephew intended to betray the native attack Curley Jim left the settlement in the company of his visitors and they parleyed around midnight at the lodge of a chief named Tecumseh Yarkekeeman and several chiefs of lesser note were also present They set out a plan to kill all of the settlers and US military Curley requested that his friend Henry Yesler be allowed to live but accepted being overruled in the matter

They resolved to attack in a few hours around 2 am Phelps wrote that that plan would have succeeded since no defender was planning for a predawn assault But Yarkekeeman convinced the raiders to try a midmorning attack using a small decoy force to draw the Decaturs men out of the welldefended areas to do battle on First Hill

There are no reliable estimates of the size of the attacking force Isaac Stevens who was not present wrote to Washington that settlers estimated that 200 to 500 Indians had taken the field against them Phelps put the number of enemy at 2000 but write Crowley and Wilma frontier military officers often inflated the number of opposing forces to reinforce their accomplishments or to minimize their failures Historian Murray Morgan writes that early reports seem to have multiplied by ten the actual numbers There could not have been more than one hundred and fifty

Many settlers resided on scattered claims divided by thick forest because to establish a land claim settlers had to live on it Some settlers doubted that the Indians would attack and had to run for the blockhouse on the morning of the battle

The first fatality of the engagement was Jack Drew a deserter from Decatur killed in friendly fire When he attempted to enter a cabin through a window and was shot dead by fifteenyearold Milton Holgate

Because the natives only common language was Chinook jargon a trade language that many of the white settlers also spoke the settlers were able to hear and understand the attackers shouted orders and revealed many incidents of the battle they were anxious to conceal

An Indian known as Jim a relative of Curleys who died a few months later in a hunting accident evaded Curleys vigilance and warned Dr Williamson of the impending attack Williamson sent a messenger to Yesler who informed Gansevoort and Decaturs troops abandoned their breakfast and returned to the positions they had held by night 52 women and children found refuge on board Decatur and others on board the barque Brontes The noncombatants of the friendly tribes took to their canoes to get out of the way

Curleys sister and Yarkekeemans mother Licumulow Nancy whom Phelps describes as short stout and incapable of running warned as she headed for her canoe that the Kliktat were gathered around Tom Peppers house which was in the forest near the crest of First Hill Decatur fired off a howitzer shell in that direction the first shot of the battle Phelps and a few others had been trying unsuccessfully to rouse the volunteers from their torpor At the sound of the howitzer shell they rushed as one for the blockhouse There Sergeant Carbine several times charged them out of one door to return as often by the other till wearying of the trouble he left them to cower behind the wooden bulwarks protected from the bullets of the foe

The third division contrary to orders charged up the trail that led towards the lake This charge met with success as they pushed the attackers back without taking any casualties themselves Klakum held a position behind a tree and shot at Peixotto standing on the blockhouse steps but missed and killed a boy Milton G Holgate who was standing a few steps higher It was the second death of a European American caused by another white

On the south end settlers on the peninsula faced off against natives on the mainland with a slough dividing them Phelps describes the incessant rattle of smallarms and an uninterrupted whistling of bullets mingled with the furious yells of the Indians but there were few casualties A settler was killed when he ducked from behind a stump to get some drinking water Clarence Bagley quoting William Bell two days after the event says the casualty was Christian White Phelps writing 17 years later says it was Robert Wilson

Hans Carl an invalided sailor on Decatur died shortly thereafter but for reasons unrelated to the battle

News of the attack spread rapidly By 4 pm it was known in Bellingham At noon the day after the battle Active steamed into Elliott Bay Governor Stevens aboard Stevens was in Phelpss words at last compelled to acknowledge the presence of hostile Indians in the Territory Active headed south in the direction of Steilacoom which seemed the most likely next target of an attack dropping the governor at Olympia the capital on the way

Yarkekeeman reported that the hostile chiefs were illprovisioned Confident of victory they expected to provision themselves from the settlers supplies They spent the next several weeks scouring the land for food

Two days after the battle Coquilton threatened through a messenger that within one moon he would return with twenty thousand warriors and attacking by land and water destroy the place in spite of all the warship could do to prevent The threat was taken seriously and leaders decided to improve Seattles defenses Henry Yesler volunteered ships cargo of house lumber and on February 1 Decaturs divisions began a twoweek project to erect a defensive palisade two fences five feet high placed eighteen inches apart and filled in with welltamped earth long and enclosing a large portion of the town A second blockhouse was also erected and an old ships cannon plus a 6pounder fieldpiece borrowed from Active were to serve as its artillery

Trees and undergrowth were removed variously attacked with levers axes and shovels or burned in place to provide an esplanade and enable Decaturs howitzer to sweep the shores Much brush was also cleared from the towns inland edges to reduce the cover for future attacks On February 24 USS Massachusetts arrived and on March 28 USS John Hancock

The fortified town did not have to face a second battle Defeat in the Battle of Seattle had discouraged the hostile natives and they did not again amass a comparable force Furthermore Governor Stevens had convinced Patkanim and his men to take on the role of bounty hunters paying them handsomely for collecting the scalps of leaders of the hostile tribes Morgan does not describe the battle as a victory for the Americans Rather he writes that both sides were dismayed the whites by the realization that the enemy really would attack a town the Indians by their first experience with exploding shells rather than cannonballs

Also by Stevenss order a courtmartial was convened at Seattle on May 15 for the trial of Klakum and twenty other Indians The military officers acquitted them deeming their actions as having been legitimate warfare against recognized combatants not criminal acts They were released after a declaration of peace It was certainly not the end of violence between settlers and natives in the region but it was the end of outright war

Nine days after the battle Chief Leschi and Chief Kitsap along with a group of 17 Indians appeared at the home of John McLeod near the Nisqually River McLeod was a former employee of the Hudsons Bay Company had a Nisqually wife and was trusted by the hostile Indians Leschi said that neither he nor his band had taken part in the attack on Seattle and he thought the attack had been foolish Leschi asked for John Swan another trusted white man to visit Leschis camp on the Green River for a peace conference When Swan did visit Leschis camp a few days later he counted about 150 warriors or men of fighting age Nearly all were from west of the Cascades with only 1020 from the east

Jack Drew a deserter from the Decatur was shot and killed by young Milton Holgate a settlers son when he tried to enter the latters cabin Holgate was killed by friendly fire and another settler died in the battle Christian White or Robert Wilson see above One sailor Hans Carl died later of causes unrelated to the battle Phelps characterizes the low casualties as incredible and miraculous given that one hundred and sixty men were for seven hours exposed to an almost uninterrupted storm of bullets

The casualties on the native side are unknown Phelps claimed personally to have seen ten men die from one shell He said that the natives later admitted to 28 dead and 80 wounded but said that the native women secreted the dead beyond all chance of discovery No Indian bodies were found on the battlefield

According to Seattle lore decades after the battle Seattles future fire chief Gardner Kellogg was excavating his house and found a shell from Decatur that had buried itself without exploding He stuck it under a stump that he was trying to burn out and went off to lunch Dexter Horton stopped by to warm the seat of his pants at the fire and as it exploded nearly became the last casualty of the battle of Seattle

Fair to Midland
Fair to Midland was an American progressive rock band based in Dallas Texas According to the bands official website their name comes from an old Texan play on the term fair to middling The band produced two selfreleased albums before signing to Serjical Strike System of a Downs Serj Tankian vanity label at Universal Republic There they released their only major record label album  in 2007 While the album broke into the Billboard 200 they eventually parted ways with Serjical Strike and later released their fourth album Arrows and Anchors in July 2011 Tentative plans for a fifth album had been discussed at the end of the Arrow and Anchors touring cycle but the band became inactive in 2013

Fair to Midland was formed in 1998 by friends Andrew Darroh Sudderth and Cliff Campbell both of Sulphur Springs Texas Sudderth originally started as the bands bassist but switched to be the bands lead vocalist after rounding out the band with more members namely Nathin Seals on bass and Jason Pintler on drums After their independent debut album in late 2001 The Carbon Copy Silver Lining Pintler left the band and was replaced by Brett Stowers For their second album 2004s Interfundastifle keyboardist Matt Langley who was a guest musician on the first album officially joined the band The album was recorded as a quintet and after release the band toured extensively to promote the albums building up a fanbase in the Dallas Texas Deep Ellum music scene However attempts to branch out into bigger music scenes such as Los Angeles proved futile for the band In 2005 Seals left the group as well While he was replaced by Jon Dicken still a lack of progress combined with increasing costs of selffunding all of their efforts and Sudderth and Campbells college aspirations led the band to contemplate breaking up Just as the band was seriously discussing a break up they received a call from Serj Tankian frontman of American hard rock band System of a Down Their albums and live shows had caught his attention and showed interest in signing them to his vanity label Serjical Strike on Universal Republic Records This rejuvenated the bands confidence and they signed on in April 2006 starting work on a new album shortly after

Shortly after signing to the Serjical Strike label The Drawn and Quartered EP was released featuring demo and live tracks from interfundastifle and a minidocumentary titled The Drawn and Quartered Kinescope which served as an introduction of the band including interviews and past concert footage Meanwhile the band worked on recording their third album with music producer David Bottrill For it the band chose to rerecord many of the songs from interfundastifle which they felt could benefit from a professional music producer and bigger production budget After a few minor delays the album entitled  was released on June 12 2007

The band toured extensively throughout 2007 and 2008 in support of the album performing at major concerts such as Coachella Rock am Ring and Rock im Park They opened for bands such as Rage Against the Machine Smashing Pumpkins Queens of the Stone Age Dir En Grey Muse and Serj Tankians solo band Notably they even teamed up Tankian at times for a live improvisational version of their song The Walls of Jericho Between 100 and 150 shows were played in support of the album in 2007 alone

Fair to Midland were the winners of the Dallas Observer Music Award in the Best Metal category for both 2007 and 2008

In August 2008 Fair to Midland began writing their fourth studio album By October Stowers stated that the band had so far written about 46 songs that were in various states of completion He also wrote that the band wanted to take their time and release the record when its done In November the band announced they had signed a record deal with E1 music and that they were aiming for an early 2011 release date Stowers stated the album would go in a darker and more cynical direction as a result of the grueling two year touring schedule in support of their prior album

On January 9 2010 the band was in an accident temporarily suspending touring and delaying recording The band crashed and flipped their van and trailer While the band were largely not seriously injured it left much of their gear destroyed Four days later the band released a short video involving postaccident footage entitled FWIW standing for For What Its Worth which included a short clip of a studio demo of a new song called A Loophole in Limbo

The band continued to work on the album into 2011 with music producer Joe Barresi By March they had revealed the title Arrows and Anchors and in April they released the first single Musical Chairs on iTunes In May the studio version of Amarillo Sleeps on My Pillow was offered for free download on the bands website The album was released on July 12 2011

On October 26 it was announced that Jon Dicken had decided to leave the band with Ryan Collier previously with Opus Dai was announced as his touring replacement A month later on November 26 Brett Stowers announced that he had left the band as well with Logan Kennedy being his replacement The band pushed forward releasing their first DVD Welcome to the Dirt in November consisting mainly of band shots and fan footage of live shows The profit from this release helped fund a professional video recording of the bands show at The Machine Shop in Flint on December 17 which was later released on the bands first widely released DVD Live at the Machine Shop in March 2012 On October 9 the band announced the release of their second DVD combined with an audio CD Live at Andys Bar consisting of footage of an acoustic live set performed by the band in March 2012 which was released on November 12

As of September 2012 the band had finished touring in support of Anchors and Arrows and announced intentions of creating a fifth album The band intended on starting by finishing some material left over from their prior album However as of early 2013 all communications from the bands websites and social media ceased Stowers who had left the band in 2011 has been the only party to discuss the band stating that all he knew was that at his time of leaving the band had accumulated substantial debt was without a label and members had scattered across the entire country

Progressive rock has commonly been used as a term to describe the bands sound by critics Keyboardist Matt Langley described his stance on this
Not the way most people define prog Prog suggests to me a band whose primary focus is mad technical skill with their instruments All in Fair to Midland strive to play well and in my opinion succeed but in that respect were certainly no match for for example Dream Theater However there are those who expand the definition to include bands whose focus may or may not be less on the technical and more about experimental instrumentation voicings unusual parts and changes  by that amended definition I suppose wed fit into some peoples idea of the prog rock mold Either way is fine with me 

He also cited the band A Perfect Circle as an inspiration for the nontechnical progressive rock sound Guitarist Cliff Campbell expanded on the bands influences stating

He also stated that primary lyricist and vocalist Darroh Sudderth is a fan of dark antiquated childrens stories and that this inspiration of The childlike imagery and sound alternating with the dark heavy aggressive parts was a defining feature of their sound

Potchefstroom High School for Boys is a high school situated in Potchefstroom South Africa It is one of the oldest schools in South Africa

With the Transvaal under British control Lord Milner the Colonial Secretary at the time created educational facilities known as the Milner Schools for Englishspeaking pupils The site for the school had been an infamous concentration camp during the 2nd South African War The first school on the land was for the children interned in the camp On 31 January 1905 accompanied by the band of the Border Regiment Sir Richard Solomon LtGovernor of Transvaal opened Potchefstroom College upon instruction from the then Education Department the school was renamed Potchefstroom High School for Boys College is a boarding school based on the English boarding schools system Founded by CD Hope who was also the first principal of Pretoria Boys High School as well as Jeppe High School for Boys the original structure had been built long before and had to close during the AngloBoer war The schoolbuilding itself was designed in Cape Dutch architecture design as was prominent in style during those times which has since been declared a local heritage site There are 3 boarding houses Granton Oxford Blue 1909 Milton Cambridge Blue 1910 and Buxton British Racing Green which was constructed much later The fourth house Barnard Royal Red is the DayBoy house These later buildings did not follow the traditional Cape Dutch styles and were built more suited to the period they were built in The schools motto Iustorum Semita Lux Splendens Latin was adapted by the founder CD Hope from Proverbs 418 and means The path of righteousness alternately the just is as a shining light

During the 1905 hunting season just before the first Springbok team went on their rugby tour the headmaster CD Hope was given the horns of a springbok by his brotherinlaw These horns mounted are in the schools museum and a springbok head forms part of the schools badge

<doc id="7738150" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7738150" title="Kambara">
Kambara
Kambara is an extinct genus of mekosuchine crocodylian that lived during the Eocene and Oligocene epochs in Australia

At around 55 million years old remains of Kambara are among the oldest Tertiary fossils found in Australia although there are some recent Cretaceous fossils that are twice that age Kambara is the oldest known mekosuchine The genus name comes from an Aboriginal term meaning crocodile

There are currently four species of Kambara described the type species K murgonensis Willis  Molnar 1993 K implexidens Salisbury  Willis 1996 K molnari Holt et al 2005 and K taraina Buchanan 2009 All four species have a generalised crocodylian body plan growing to sizes similar to the modern Saltwater Crocodile Crocodylus porosus Kambara shows an interesting characteristic of having multiple bite patterns within the same genus Kambara murgonensis has a near complete overbite K implexidens a more interlocking dentition and K molnarai an intermediate condition While initially thought to be the most primitive member of an Australasian radiation of mekosuchine crocodylians recent studies Holt et al 2007 have suggested that this may not be the case and that there are at least two separate lineages in Australia

Kambara and other mekosuchines are often thought to have been better adapted to movement on land than are living crocodilians The degree of twisting or torsion in the humerus of Kambara is less than that of living crocodilians and the shoulder joint of Kambara is stronger and allows for greater motion than those of modern species However Kambara is still thought to have been at least partially aquatic because its head is flattened like that of typical aquatic crocodilians

Fossils have been found at the Murgon fossil site in southeastern Queensland
