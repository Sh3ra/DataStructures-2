The Gift Star Trek Voyager
The Gift is the second episode of the of the American science fiction television series  the 70th episode overall Set in the 24th century the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far from the rest of the Federation The episode marks the last appearance of Kes until the episode 

After  USS Voyager still remains without working warp propulsion and is infested with Borg technology Seven of Nine the Borg drone saved from the destruction of her cube has her connection with the Borg collective severed She is now able to function as an individual but she is shocked by the change and still refers to herself in the first person plural Her body nevertheless starts to heal and reject Borg technology The Doctor decides that he should remove her Borg implants so she can recover

The Doctor hesitates to operate on a patient who refuses medical attention but Captain Janeway who believes that Seven of Nine is unable to make decisions for herself in her current state convinces him to do it During the operation she starts to have a seizure caused by an implant in her brain Kes uses her increasingly powerful telepathic abilities to disable the implant and stop the seizure

The Doctor removes as much of the technology as possible save for those that are too much part of her vital systems but Seven of Nine is upset by the result She is not used to being an individual and she repeatedly demands that she be returned to the Collective Janeway refuses and asks her to help with removing the Borg technology in Voyagers systems

Meanwhile Kes and Tuvok meditate Kes has learned to manipulate matter on a subatomic level and begins to see beyond even that

As Seven of Nine begins her work on repairs she is closely guarded by Harry Kim and a security guard While looking at the hardware Seven sees a transmitter and her Borg impulses are sparked into action by the stimulus She pushes Ensign Kim out of the room shuts the door and barricades herself in the room She accesses a subspace transmitter and tries to send a message to the Borg Kes senses that something is wrong and uses her abilities to send an electrical surge that stops Seven

Seven is held in the brig where she has a long talk with Janeway about her separation from the Collective Meanwhile Neelix and Kes talk about their past She tells him about her new powers and demonstrates them Neelix is hurt as the table they were sitting at starts to change The ships structural integrity begins to destabilize When Janeway and Tuvok enter the room they see Kes on the floor and her body changing  destabilizing at the subatomic level as Tuvok explains The Doctor is unable to explain this reaction he only knows that her powers must be suppressed or she might die

Seven of Nine unsuccessfully tries to break through the brigs forcefield Janeway comes inside her cell with information about her past Before assimilation she was a human girl named Annika Hansen The new information enrages her and her wish to return to the Borg remains unchanged

Kes and Janeway have their last talk and Kes is overcome by her powers warping her very surroundings She cannot control herself and becomes a danger to the ship She and Janeway agree she should leave the ship before it is destroyed Kes boards a shuttle and puts some distance between herself and Voyager

As her atomic structure destabilizes she contacts Voyager and tells them she is about to give them a gift As she vanishes Voyagers warp core begins to function at more than 120 capacity The ship hurtles through space ending up over 9500 light years away in a flash The crew realizes they are safely beyond Borg space and ten years closer to home With their friend Kes far away and on another plane of existence the crew try to accept Seven into their midst Reluctantly she accepts their help and is seen later with most of her Borg implants removed now wearing a bodysuit to conceal the remaining implants and having her blonde hair grown back contemplating her new appearance in closed thoughts

Penicillium crustosum
Penicillium crustosum is a bluegreen or bluegrey mold that can cause food spoilage particularly of proteinrich foods such as meats and cheeses It is identified by its complex biseriate conidiophores on which phialides produce asexual spores It can grow at fairly low temperatures it is a psychrophile and in low water activity environments

Penicillium crustosum produces mycotoxins most notoriously the neurotoxic penitrems including the best known penitrem toxin penitrem A and including penitrems A through G Penitrem G has been shown to have insecticidal activity In addition P crustosum can produce thomitrems A and E and roquefortine C Consumption of foods spoiled by this mold can cause transient neurological symptoms such as tremors In dogs symptoms can include vomiting convulsion tremors ataxia and tachycardia

HexapodTelescope
The HexapodTelescope HPT is a telescope located at Cerro Armazones Observatory in northern Chile The RitcheyChrtien reflecting telescope is notable for the design of telescope mount Instead of the typical mounting where the telescope moves on two rotating axes the mirror end of the telescope is supported by six extensible struts an arrangement known as a Stewart platform This configuration allows the telescope to move in all six spatial degrees of freedom and also provides strong structural integrity As a result the ratio of bearing pressure and its own weight is very high Furthermore the sixleg structure allows for a very precise positioning and repeatability The disadvantage of the system is that controlling and aiming a hexapodmounted telescope is much more complex than with conventional telescope mounts

The mounting was designed by engineers of the company Vertex in collaboration with astronomers of the Astronomy Institute of the Ruhr University Bochum AIRUB in Germany Led by Prof Rolf Chini the HPT was thoroughly tested at AIRUB In 2006 it was moved to its new location on Cerro Armazones Observatory in the Atacama Desert in Chile AIRUB in collaboration with the Astronomy Department of the Catholic University of the North UCN is developing an observatory there A new control building was built next to the HPT on the summit of Cerro Murphy a subsidiary peak of Cerro Armazones

Together with the Landessternwarte HeidelbergKnigstuhl AIRUB developed the Bochum Echelle Spectrograph for the Optical BESO for the HPT It is a copy of the Fiberfed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph FEROS operated by the European Southern Observatory

Agostino Codazzi
Giovanni Battista Agostino Codazzi alternatively known in Latin America as Agustn Codazzi 12 July 1793  7 February 1859 was an ItaloVenezuelan soldier scientist geographer cartographer and governor of Barinas 18461847 He made his main investigations and cartographic work in Venezuela and Colombia thereby creating for both countries a complete set of maps and statistics after the tumultuous postindependence years from the Spanish Empire

Codazzi was born in the Italian city of Lugo Since young he appreciated the ideals of the French Revolution and after his studies at the military academy Scuola di Artiglieria of Pavia actively served in the Napoleon Army

With the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 Codazzi moved away from Italy and after some travels went to Venezuela where he offered his military knowledge to Simon Bolivar

Successively he received the task of mapping the area of the Maracaibo Lake and the borders between Venezuela Colombia and Ecuador The Venezuelan government named him Colonel and ordered the creation of an Atlas of Venezuela a task that gave him international fame in Paris Codazzi was awarded in 1842 the Legion of Honor by the King of France on behalf of the French Academy of Science

Agustin Codazzi meanwhile took the Venezuelan citizenship from president Jos Antonio Pez and became Governor of Barinas a region of southwestern Venezuela In those years his academic activity of geographer was continuously interrupted by his duties as a military commander suffocating many revolts

Codazzi even promoted the creation in the 1840s of the Colonia Tovar a small German settlement in the Venezuelan central mountains that still exists today and has become one of the main tourist attractions near Maracay

With the fall of Pez after a military insurrection Codazzi was forced to escape to Ccuta Colombia where he continued his geographic and mapping activity with military duties for the Colombian government

In 1852 Codazzi did a scientific and cartographic inspection of Panama for the British government in 1854  even if with no official mention of Codazzis work the Panama Canal project was done following exactly his indications and route

Codazzi died of malaria in February 1859 at the small town of Espritu Santo in the Colombian mountains in the arms of his friend Manuel Mara Paz while he was mapping the area for the Comisin Corogrfica The town where he died has been renamed Aldea Codazzi and now is a city with a population of nearly 70000 inhabitants

Venezuela honored the memory of Agustin Codazzi placing his remains inside the National Pantheon of Venezuela in 1942 where he is considered one the Heroes of Venezuela

Colombias national geographical and cartographical institute a government agency is named after Agustin Codazzi Instituto Geogrfico Agustin Codazzi

Quiescence search
Quiescence search is an algorithm typically used to evaluate minimax game trees in gameplaying computer programs It mitigates the effect of the horizon problem faced by AI engines for various games like chess and Go

Human players usually have enough intuition to decide whether to abandon a badlooking move or search a promising move to a great depth A quiescence search attempts to emulate this behavior by instructing a computer to search interesting positions to a greater depth than quiet ones to make sure there are no hidden traps and to get a better estimate of its value

Any sensible criterion may be used to distinguish quiet moves from noisy moves high activity high movement on a chess board extensive capturing in Go for example is commonly used for board games As the main motive of quiescence search is usually to get a good value out of an imperfect evaluation function it may also make sense to detect wide fluctuations in values returned by a simple heuristic evaluator over several ply Modern chess engines may search certain moves up to 2 or 3 times deeper than the minimum In highly unstable games like Go and reversi a rather large proportion of computer time may be spent on quiescence searching

The horizon effect is a problem in artificial intelligence which can occur when a search of a game tree is limited In many games the number of possible states or positions is too great for an exhaustive search to be practical Computer programs search a subset of the game tree and use heuristics to estimate the value of individual positions Due to the limitation of this search its possible for the computer to identify a move that is optimal up to the given search depth but that leads to a suboptimal position beyond that depth of which the computer is unaware Quiescence search attempts to mitigate this issue by extending the search depth in high activity positions where the heuristic value may have significant fluctuations between moves

ShellHaus
The ShellHaus Shell House is a classical modernist architectural masterpiece that stands overlooking the Landwehrkanal in the Tiergarten district of Berlin Germany It was designed by Emil Fahrenkamp and was built in 193031

In 1929 a competition was held between five architects to determine the designer of a prestigious new office block to house the headquarters of the mineral oil company and Royal Dutch Shell subsidiary RhenaniaOssag The victor was the German architect and professor Emil Fahrenkamp 18851966

After almost two years in construction ShellHaus opened in 1932 At the time the building was noted for its modernist design for its striking wavelike facade and for being one of the first steelframed highrise buildings in Berlin In retrospect it is regarded as Fahrenkamps masterpiece and one of the most significant office block designs of the Weimar Republic 

ShellHaus simple graceful forms are stylistically reminiscent of the German modern realist movement New Objectivity but Fahrenkamp also incorporated more traditional aspects to his design 

The most eyecatching feature of ShellHaus is its main facade which jumps forward in six gentle waves whilst at the same time increasing in height from six levels five at the back to ten The building itself comprises four wings situated around a foursided inner courtyard

Before the building of ShellHaus the Tiergarten section of Berlin was primarily the location of expensive elegant and luxurious private residences Afterwards and after World War II the area housed more offices with some of the former townhouses and villas gone and others having been converted to office use The street itself became a significant connecting thoroughfare

During the Second World War ShellHaus was used by the naval high command and the cellars were converted into a makeshift hospital 

Despite the upper floors being damaged in the Battle of Berlin at the close of the war ShellHaus was one of Berlins few great edifices to survive the widespread destruction of the city relatively unscathed After clearing away the war damage in 1946 the Berlin electricity board BEWAG made ShellHaus its head office 

In 1958 ShellHaus was designated an historical monument in order to protect it However this acknowledgement of its architectural importance did not save the building from postwar dilapidation and it remained in a degraded state for many years to follow

Between 1965 and 1967 the ShellHaus site was extended northwards with the construction of two similarly steelframed buildings designed by the German architect Paul Baumgarten Being comparatively conventional and unremarkable in design they were not included under the original buildings historical monument protection and a 1995 application to rectify this was squashed

When the subject of the buildings long overdue restoration was raised in the 1980s progress was hampered by a dispute over the investment needed that continued into the mid1990s Renovation work had been carried out on the courtyard faade in the early 80s but this had failed to meet the required standards

In 1995 Bewag moved out of ShellHaus in readiness for the renovation project In 1997 after 13 years of discord the restoration work began At the time the total cost was estimated at around 50 million deutschmarks but by the time work was completed in February 2000 the expenditure had escalated to around 80 million marks A major contributory factor to the considerable expense was the need to reopen the Longarina quarry near Rome owned by company CIMEP in Tivoli in order to supply the appropriate travertine rock for the building faade

The expenditure and painstaking detail invested in ShellHaus did not go unrewarded the year 2000 saw the renovation work awarded the monument preservation prize the Ferdinand von Quast Medal

In March 2000 the Berlin energy supplier GASAG became the new owner and occupant of ShellHaus

ShellHaus has several highprofile fans including the acclaimed German film director Wim Wenders  who featured the building in his 1970 directorial debut Summer in the City  and the architect Meinhard von Gerkan who said that for him it was the most beautiful building in Berlin

On the other hand one of the only times on record that Adolf Hitler inveighed against a specific building in Berlin as opposed to modern urban architecture in general was when he insulted Fahrenkamp with Youre the man who committed the crime of the Shell Building Despite this criticism Fahrenkamp received some commissions for exhibition buildings and had dealings with Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels Hermann Gring the head of the Luftwaffe and the Four Year Plan and Albert Speer Hitlers favorite architect and later Minister of Armaments and War Production

Revolution of the Park
The Revolution of the Park Revolucin del Parque also known as the Revolution of 90 was an uprising against the national government of Argentina that took place on July 26 1890 and started with the takeover of the Buenos Aires Artillery Park It was led by members of the Civic Union which would later give rise to the modern Radical Civic Union against the presidency of Miguel Jurez Celman of the National Autonomist Party Though it failed in its main goals the revolution forced Jurez Celmans resignation and marked the decline of the elite of the Generation of 80

Near the end of 1889 general discontent mainly due to high inflation encouraged the Civic Union led by Aristbulo del Valle and Leandro Alem to attempt to oust President Miguel Jurez Celman whose conservative rule like those of previous presidents had been marked by electoral fraud and corruption

The uprising was led by a civil revolutionary junta and by General Manuel J Campos It counted on the indirect support of General and former President Julio Argentino Roca and on the lack of opposition by General Bartolom Mitre
The uprising started on 26 July 1890 at the Buenos Aires Artillery Park It met with swift repression on the part of the government forces led by generals Carlos Pellegrini the VicePresident Roque Senz Pea and Nicols Lavalle Lacking initiative and ammunition the revolutionaries were defeated in a matter of days but the image of the government had suffered Senator Pizarro demanded the resignation of the entire Executive Branch and the Senate presided by General Roca but President Jurez Celman was the only one to accept VicePresident Pellegrini took office in his stead to complete the remaining two years of his presidential term 
The Revolution of the Park was intended as a means to avoid the ruin of the country by bringing down a government that represents illegality and corruption according to its Manifesto The revolutionary junta rejected living without voice or vote witness the disappearance of rules principles guarantees tolerate the usurpation of our political rights and keeping those in power who have wrought the disgrace of the republic and denounced that there is no republic no federal system no representative government no administration no morality Political life has turned into a forprofit industry 

The success of the revolution was limited to the resignation of Jurez Celman who had been notorious for his corruption and abuse of power The key elements outlined in its Manifesto however continued to be present in Argentine politics as shown by the series of uprisings Revolution of 1893 and Revolution of 1905

Mardale Ill Bell
Mardale Ill Bell is a fell in the English Lake District rising to the south west of Haweswater Reservoir It stands on the watershed between Mardale and Kentmere and is the highpoint of the southeastern ridge of High Street midway on its course to Harter Fell

The head of the Kentmere valley lies to the southwest of the fell with rough slopes leading down over scree to Kentmere Reservoir Mardale Ill Bell sends out a short grasstopped spur Lingmell End which splits the head of the valley into two

The northeastern face of Mardale Ill Bell forms the craggy backdrop to Blea Water This perfect corrie tarn is the deepest in the Lake District at 207ft Its outflow feeds Haweswater joining with that of a second tarn Small Water Between the two Mardale Ill Bell throws out the rocky spur of Piot Crag Two tiers of crag drop down to the confluence at Mardale Waters

Southeast of the summit a rough narrowing ridge drops to Nan Bield Pass at 2100ft before rising again over rocky steps to Harter Fell Nan Bield was the ancient trading route between Kentmere and the now drowned village of Mardale Green submerged by the raising of Haweswater in the 1940s Near the shore of Small Water on the descending path are a number of stone shelters pointers to the earlier importance of the pass These each provide refuge for one person in extremis entrance being via crawling

Northwest from Mardale Ill Bell the grassy ridge crosses a wet depression and then expands into a wide plateau triangular in plan High Street and Thornthwaite Crag are at the other two corners with the Roman road crossing north to south

The summit has two large cairns on grass the northern one being the top The view westwards is confined by higher fells but the Ill Bell ridge and Coniston range are seen to good effect Blea Water and Small Water can be brought into sight from the rim of the crags

The most popular routes of ascent are on the Mardale side From the road end Nan Bield pass can be used or the impressive scenery of Piot Crag can be attained from the shore of either Blea or Small Water From Kentmere Nan Bield provides the obvious route although a pathless climb up to the top of Lingmell End is possible

The family is contained in Brachycera infraorder Tabanomorpha and several of its constituent groups have been recently elevated to family rank Atherix and related genera now comprise the Athericidae Vermileo and related genera now comprise the Vermileonidae and the genera Austroleptis and Bolbomyia are each now the sole members of their own families Austroleptidae and Bolbomyiidae The subfamily Spaniinae was sometimes accorded family rank but this is not accepted in the most recent revisionary classification

Sisymbrium irio
Sisymbrium irio known as London rocket is a plant in the family Brassicaceae It is an annual herb exceeding three feet in height with open slender stem branches The flowers are small with four pale yellow petals The basal leaves are broad and often lobed while the upper leaves are linear in shape and up to four inches long The fruit is a long narrow cylindrical silique which stays green when ripe The younger pods overtop the flowers When dried the fruit has small red oblong seeds
The common name London rocket allegedly comes from its abundance after the Great Fire of London in 1666 However Dr E J Salisbury in his study of the bombsites of London after the Great Fire of 1940 failed to find a single specimen nor has any other reliable observer reported it according to R S R Fitter

This species is considered a weed in the Southwestern United States and other regions where it has been introduced

The leaves seeds and flowers are edible with a spicy flavor similar to cultivated rocket London rocket is used in the Middle East to treat coughs and chest congestion to relieve rheumatism to detoxify the liver and spleen and to reduce swelling and clean wounds The Bedouin use the leaf of London Rocket as a tobacco substitute The cured pods can be placed in a basket with live coals and shaken until the pods are parched then ground into meal and made into soup or stew

Peter Laslett
Peter Laslett 18 December 1915  8 November 2001 was an English historian

Born Thomas Peter Ruffell Laslett and educated at the Watford Grammar School for Boys Peter Laslett studied history at St Johns College Cambridge in 1935 and graduated with a double first in 1938 During World War II he learned Japanese and worked at Bletchley Park and Washington decoding Japanese naval intelligence It was at Bletchley Park that he met his future wife Janet Crockett Clark whom he married in 1947

Returning to Cambridge in 1948 with a research fellowship at St Johns College Laslett edited Robert Filmers political writings Patriarcha and Other Political Writings 1949 According to noted historian JGA Pocock it was with this work that Laslett provided the initial inspiration for the Cambridge School of the history of political thought the methods of which are now widely practised throughout the profession Laslett combined such academic activity with a lifelong concern to engage a wider audience He worked simultaneously as a BBC radio producer for the Third Programme One product of this desire to reach a wider audience was his pathbreaking and highlypopular book The World We Have Lost England Before the Industrial Age 1965 US edition 1966 issued in a second edition in 1971 and in a retitled third revised edition The World We Have Lost Further Explored 1983 US edition 1984 Simon Mitton credits Laslett with having launched in 1948 the radio broadcasting career of the astronomer Fred Hoyle

In 1953 Laslett was appointed a university lecturer in history at Cambridge and was elected a fellow Trinity College in the same year He continued work in the history of political theory discovering Lockes library and demonstrating against the accepted account that John Lockes Two Treatises on Government had been written prior to the English Glorious Revolution of 16889 remarking that the Two Treatises is an Exclusion Tract not a Revolution Pamphlet Laslett published an edition of the treatises in 1960 subsequently reprinted many times which is now recognised as the definitive account of these pillars of modern liberal democracy From 1957 he founded and coedited Philosophy Politics and Society a series of collections on political philosophy

Laslett took up an entirely different line of historical research from the early 1960s Trying to understand 17thcentury listings of the inhabitants of Clayworth and Cogenhoe Northamptonshire he became persuaded of the need to pursue historical demography more systematically In 1964 Laslett and Tony Wrigley cofounded the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure With funding from the Social Science Research Council the Cambridge Group worked alongside amateur volunteers on local records and established the journal Local Population Studies

Lasletts practical reformism found an outlet from the 1960s in his efforts together with Michael Young to develop the Open University In 1963 he ran a series of 5 programmes on Anglia Television the Dawn University which attracted a great deal of attention although the funding had to wait two more years until Harold Wilson took up the idea

When told of his family history of Kent yeomen back to 1600 he looked it over and said Good Not a gentleman in 400 years

Laslett was Reader in Politics and the History of Social Structure at Cambridge University the title reflecting his own unusual mix of historical interests from 1966 until retirement in 1983 At this point his interests turned to the historical understanding and practical betterment of the elderly Laslett played a pivotal role in founding the University of the Third Age in 1982

He died in 2001 aged 85 and was interred at Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford and was survived by his wife Janet sons George and Robert and grandchildren Vivian Alden and Claire His fine library of early printed books by and about Filmer Locke and political thought including political economy was sold by Quaritch in 2006

Juliana poem
Juliana Exeter Book fol 65b76a is one of the four signed poems ascribed to the mysterious poet Cynewulf and is an account of the martyring of St Juliana of Nicomedia The one surviving manuscript dated between 970 and 990 is preserved in the Exeter Book between the poems The Phoenix and The Wanderer Juliana is one of only five Old English poetic texts that describe the lives of saints The others include Elene Andreas and Guthlac A and B

Juliana is Cynewulfs second longest work totaling 731 lines However due to damage to the Exeter Book over timesuch as staining charring and the loss of pagesthere are two gaps in the text of Juliana amounting to a loss of 130 to 140 lines Through comparative analyses it has been determined that no more than a single page worth of material could be missing from either gap and it is therefore very likely that a single sheet which would have been folded in the middle to form two pages was accidentally lost when the original manuscript was being bound

Cynewulfs Juliana is presented entirely in Old English alliterative verse and is transmitted in a late WestSaxon dialect Cynewulf likely derived the poem from earlier Latin accounts of the same storysimilar to those appearing in the Acta sanctorum or the Martyrology however it is likely that Cynewulf was adapting his version from an unknown Latin source that has since been lost

The Juliana story takes place during the Diocletian persecution and was probably first set in writing during the rule of Constantine I The story begins by illustrating the harsh life for Christians under the rule of Galerius Maximian describing various acts of violence visited upon Christians Juliana is introduced as the daughter of Africanus of Nicomedia who has promised Julianas hand in marriage to Eleusias a wealthy senator and friend of Maximian Although Juliana was born a pagan she has converted to Christianity and so she vehemently resists being married to the pagan Eleusias not wanting to violate the relationship she shares with God

When she publicly voices her dissatisfaction Eleusias becomes outraged and insists that he has been publicly insulted Africanus upon hearing of this becomes similarly outraged believing his daughter has embarrassed him by refusing the hand of a man of much higher status As a result Africanus declares that Eleusias is free to punish Juliana in whatever way he wishes

Eleusias proceeds to have Juliana stripped naked hung from a tree by her hair whipped and beaten with rods for over two hours Then she is thrown into prison

While in prison Juliana is visited by a demon pretending to be an angel of God who tries to trick her into blasphemy Juliana being the epitome of unwavering Christian faith doesnt fall for the charade and prays to God for guidance A voice tells her to reach out and grab the demon and Juliana obeys

This point forward contains the bulk of the story in which Juliana and the demon have a lengthy war of words with Juliana clearly dominating She holds the demon and forces it to confess all of its wicked deeds several times over ostensibly humiliating him forever in the kingdom of Hell

After her victory over the visiting demon Eleusias comes back for Juliana and seems to offer her a chance to change her mind Not surprisingly Juliana refuses him once again and just as scathingly as before

Eleusias then attempts to have Juliana burned alive in hot lead Yet even though he has Juliana placed in the fire not a spot on her body or clothes is touched by the flames Angrier than ever Eleusias finally resolves to have Juliana beheaded for which she becomes a Christian martyr

The entire story as told by Cynewulf deviates little from the Latin source he likely used with the same progress of action and phraseology observed in both texts However there are some unsubtle differences worth mentioning One is that the character of Eleusius is portrayed in Cynewulfs text with a much more sinister and intolerant manner to his behaviour In the Acta Sanctorum Eleusius is presented as an easygoing man willing to accept Christianity just as long as he is not baptized a practice that would compromise his position as a powerful senator

In Cynewulfs version however Eleusias eagerly worships the heathen gods and his faith in the devilinspired idols is equitable to Julianas faith in her own Christian God Thus Cynewulf polarizes Juliana and Eleusius in a way that is analogous to the conflict of good and evil In fact Cynewulf may have been trying to play on an AngloSaxon idea of a social construct called a dryht The argument goes that according to AngloSaxon ethos a good king is a provider who earns the loyalty of those he governs Cynewulf could have used this notion to illustrate a clear difference between Julianas God the good king and Satanpagan gods the bad king This is evident in the fact that Juliana is repeatedly guided and protected with the one exception of the beheading while the demon an agent of Satan is coerced into serving his master and is offered no guidance or protection

A further difference to be noted between Cynewulfs Juliana and its counterpart in the Acta Sanctorum include the authors omission of Julianas insistence that she will only marry Eleusius if he becomes a prefect This was likely left out by Cynewulf to show Juliana as a polished saint and further magnify her polarization to Eleusius There is also an important stylistic difference attributed to the adaptation efforts of Cynewulf namely the importing of military or battlefield language into the story Although this is a recurring theme in both Latin and Old English literature the military language does not appear in the Latin counterparts such as the Acta Sanctorum and so it is believed that Cynewulf probably wove it in for two possible reasons the first being to make Juliana easier to relate to the second to create the metaphor that Julianas spirit was a sort of impenetrable fortress impervious to the attacks of Satan and his demonic henchmen

It is said that Cynewulfs Juliana seems to lack the emotional vigour and imagination of some of the poets other compositions The language is thought to be less elaborate but still maintains the rhetorical cunning that Cynewulf is accustomed to As in his Elene the Old English tradition of placing the characters and events of the story in a heroic setting is upheld Juliana is celebrated as a martyr who defeats the advances of the devil The idea of a woman figuring prominently in a tale such as this was not new to AngloSaxons Germanic literature often permitted women to play instrumental roles in the heroic setting of events For instance through Bedes writings we hear of such women providing the stimulus for political and religious developments in Britain

Jinzhou Operation
The Jinzhou Chinchow Operation was an operation in 1931 during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which was a preliminary contributing factor to the outbreak of the Second SinoJapanese War in 1937

In late November 1931 Imperial Japanese Army commander in chief General Shigeru Honj dispatched 10000 soldiers in 13 armored trains escorted by a squadron of bombers in an advance on Jinzhou from Mukden This force advanced to within 30 kilometers of Chinchow when it received an order to withdraw The operation was cancelled by Japanese War Minister General Jir Minami due to the acceptance of modified form of a League of Nations proposal for a neutral zone to be established as a buffer zone between the Republic of China proper and Manchuria pending a future ChinaJapanese peace conference by the civilian government of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir in Tokyo

However the two sides failed to reach a lasting agreement The Wakatsuki government soon fell and was replaced by a new cabinet led by Prime Minister Tsuyoshi Inukai Further negotiations with the Kuomintang government failing the Japanese government approved an increase in the military forces in Manchuria In December the rest of the 20th Infantry Division along with the 38th Mixed Brigade of the 19th Infantry Division were sent into Manchuria from Korea while the 8th Mixed Brigade 10th Infantry Division was sent from Japan

Following the defeat of General Ma Zhanshan in Heilongjiang province and in anticipation of reinforcements a new Japanese offensive was launched in Manchuria on December 21 General Honjo insisted that his troops were moving out to clear the country of bandits and added that the Chinese evacuation of Chinchow was absolutely imperative Most of the bandits were actually the organizing AntiJapanese Volunteer Armies but some real bandits were also exploiting the chaos following the collapse of the Chinese government and its Northeastern Army following the Mukden Incident and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria

While the other Japanese forces and collaborationist Manchurian troops spread out from their bases along the South Manchurian Railway rail lines to clear the countryside from Mukden the Japanese headquarters in Manchuria the brigades of the 12th Infantry Division advanced southward in the night supported by squadrons of Japanese bombers to force the Chinese to evacuate Jinzhou

The Japanese estimated the Chinese at Jinzhou had 84000 defenders with 58 artillery pieces placed to support two separate systems of entrenchments defending the city The Chinese first defensive line 20 miles north of the city was a series of trenches aimed to stop the Japanese advance at the Taling River Bridge on the PeipingMukden Railway The Chinese had a second line of earthworks and entrenchments completely encircling Jinzhou to fall back on if the Japanese forces broke through the first line

Japanese Lieutenant General Jir Tamons troops cautiously advanced south from Mukden The temperature was 30 below zero and Japanese forces were camouflaged in white Japanese reconnaissance aircraft reported a force of at least 3000 Chinese bandits waiting to defend Panshan County Brushing aside these Chinese skirmishers in a series of minor clashes Tamon prepared to meet and crush the first serious Chinese resistance expected at Goubangzi 50 kilometers north of Jinzhou

By the evening of December 31 1931 the Japanese advance guard was fifteen kilometers from Jinzhou on the banks of the Taling river General Tamon halted briefly to bring up the rest of his 2nd Division for the final drive on Jinzhou The Japanese War Office announced in a radio broadcast The Battle of the Taling River setting up microphones behind the Japanese lines arranging an elaborate hookup to broadcast the sound of firing to Tokyo but then had to call off the broadcast when the Chinese retreated without giving combat

Japanese forces occupied Jinzhou on January 3 1932 with the local populace waving Japanese flags homemade during the night to appease the conquerors

On the Chinese side confusion reigned The old government of Chiang Kaishek at Nanjing had resigned and a new one under Premier Sun Fo had been formed Additionally Marshal Zhang Xueliangs defenders were in disorderly retreat toward the Great Wall leaving only a small garrison to protect the few government functionaries who remained behind At Nanjing Eugene Chen the new Kuomintang Foreign Minister asserted that his government had never ordered evacuation of Jinzhou but on the contrary had ordered Marshal Zhang repeatedly to stand his ground Nine Chinese generals in various parts of China denounced Premier Sun Fos new government blaming it for the humiliating loss of Jinzhou without a struggle

The day after the fall of Jinzhou the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Shanhaiguan thus completing its military control over south Manchuria

Charisma film
The film is about a dispute between a number of people about a unique but possibly toxic tree growing in an unnamed forest The film is largely seen from the point of view of Goro Yabuike Kji Yakusho a police negotiator who has been relieved of his duties following his failure to prevent the death of an important hostage He stands in the middle of the conflicting opinions about the future of the tree and has to decide which course to commit himself to

Goro Yabuike is a hostage negotiator He attends an incident where an MP is being held at gunpoint The captors ransom note reads Restore the Rules of the World When Yabuike has a chance to shoot the hostagetaker he hesitates The captor kills the MP and is in turn killed by the police Afterwards Yabuike explains that he thought he could help both men He is suspended from duty

He is dropped off in the middle of a mysterious forest He comes across various people who are in a dispute about an apparently unique tree named Charisma growing in a clearing in the forest Jinbo believes the plant is toxic will eventually kill the whole forest She wants to poison the tree so that the forest can be restored to its original condition Kiriyama a former sanatorium patient wants to protect the tree even if this leads to the death of the rest of the forest Other military figures want to take the tree away for a collector

Yabuike becomes the central figure in the dispute somehow able to decide what will happen After the tree has been stolen by the milias recaptured by Kiriyama with Yabuikes help and burned by Jinbo a new bigger tree appears possibly similar to Charisma Yabuike mulls over the two choices he faces saving the individual tree or saving the whole forest He decides that the dichotomy is a false one First that life and death are part of the same force and second that every tree is a special tree and together they are a forest but simultaneously no tree signifies anything more than any other Ultimately some will live and some will die and some will be killed and some will be saved

When the head of the militia takes Jinbo hostage Yabuike has no hesitation in shooting though not killing him The final scene shows Yabuike making his way back to the city to seek treatment for the injured militia In the distance the city can be seen in flames


The screenplay originally written in the early 1990s earned Kiyoshi Kurosawa a scholarship from the Sundance Institute to study filmmaking at the United States

Charisma was shown at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival It was later released in Japan on February 26 2000

Kris Nelson of Dreamlogicnet gave the film a favorable review noting that the soundtrack is perfect The film has been interpreted by some as an allegorical tale about the structure of Japanese society and the tension between the importance of individuality on the one hand and the importance of the group on the other It is also possible to discern an ecological message Travis Mackenzie Hoover of Exclaim said with its combination of Tarkovskian natural wonder Beckett absurdity and good old fashioned movie lan its guaranteed that youll care enough to see into its deeply troubled heart of darkness

Harold F Clayton
Harold Fooshee Clayton May 9 1954  May 26 2015 was a noted sculptor and stonecarver best known for several sets of lifesize sculptures of cows on display at various public sites in Texas

Initially interested in painting Clayton studied art at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston Massachusetts and the University of North Texas in Denton Texas graduating cum laude with a BFA in 1977 He moved to stone as a medium and spent the years from 1982 to 1987 in Pietrasanta Italy studying carving in the studio of Sem Ghelardini

While still in Italy Clayton accepted a commission for four sets of five marble cows from for the Trammell Crow Company a large Dallas real estate development concern Three of the sets now stand in Texas at the Arboretum at Great Hills in Austin at Las Colinas in Irving and at Trinity Lake Park in Dallas The fourth set is in Milwaukee Wisconsin A sculpture of a half completed cow emerging from stone sits in the front yard of Claytons former home in Dallas

The cows at these sites stand where live cows actually grazed in the recent past In fact the models for the sculptures were made in 1980 from cows standing on the hill where the Las Colinas cows now appear to graze Each cow required four tons of marble The cows at the Arboretum site are much loved by children

Clayton maintained a workshop in Dallas and was a member of the Stone Carvers Guild He died of lung cancer in 2015

Nuna 3
The Nuna 3 is a solar car developed by Nuon Solar Team form the Delft University of Technology in 20042005 for the 2005 World Solar Challenge

It succeeded the Nuna2 the solar car that scored a second consecutive win for this solar team by winning the World Solar Challenge for the third time in a row

Nuna 3 was one of the favourites for the 2005 edition of the World Solar Challenge with a prerace testdrive recorded top speed of 130kmh The final result was that the 3021 kilometers between Darwin and Adelaide were covered in a record 29 hours and 11 minutes averaging about 103kmh

It has very efficient solar cells of a type normally used to power orbital satellites as had the previous Nunas and it has better aerodynamics and is lighter than its predecessors

It was designed and built by 11 students from different disciplines of the Delft University of Technology who have partly put their studies on hold for this They used the hightech labs and workshops of the University and as with the Nuna 2 they received advice from Wubbo Ockels the first Dutch astronaut and professor at the University

To have a good chance to win the car has to

The solar cells are made of gallium arsenide GaAs and consist of three layers Sunlight that penetrates the upper layer is used in the lower layers resulting in an efficiency of over 26 This type of solar cell is among the best available currently Apart from efficiency size also matters so the entire upper surface of the Nuna 3 is covered with them except for the cockpit

Efficiency is optimal when the cells are hit by the solar rays perpendicularly If not output is reduced by roughly the cosine of the angle with the perpendicular Because the 2005 race was held in September as opposed to October or November in previous years the sun was lower in the sky its earlier in spring To compensate for this as many cells as possible were placed at the sides most notably on the wheel caps
A solar cell gives a certain amount of current for a certain amount of sunlight The voltage depends on the load more precisely the resistance of the load The power is the product of voltage and current and therefore also depends on the load Over a certain voltage the current of the solar cell quickly drops to zero as the graph illustrates

However the batteries have a fairly constant voltage which also has a rather different value than that of the solar cells So a voltage transformation is needed A special type of DCDC converter is used to ensure the load resistance presented to the solar cells is such that the solar cells give maximum power so also at the top of the green line in the graph This is called a Maximum power point tracker MPPT Here too the goal is to have this conversion achieve maximum efficiency 97

The aerodynamic drag is an important part of the total resistance Important are the frontal surface and the streamline Any deviation from the ideal streamline will cause turbulence which costs energy The ideal streamline is achieved in various stages
From meteorological data from the area where the contest is to take place it can be concluded that there will likely be a strong sidewind The wheel caps of the Nuna 3 are designed such that a sidewind will have a propulsory effect

The electromotor is totally encased in the rear wheel to minimise loss through mechanical transmission from motor to wheel such as in a normal car in the gear box and cardan The motor is an improved version of the original 1993 Motor of the Spirit of Biel III by the Engineering School of Biel Switzerland now Berner Fachhochschule Technik und Informatik The improvements are due to completely redeveloped digital power electronics and control realized 1999 They allowed for 50 more power over 2400 W and a 45 higher torque compared to the 1993 Spirit of Biel II The efficiency of the total drive system including the power electronics losses is also improved and is now over 98 But as the graph shows this depends somewhat on the speed and increases with speed The design was initially made to reach its maximum performance at the normal cruising speed of the solar car at around 100kmh

During one of the test drives in the Netherlands the Nuna 3 achieved a speed of 130kmh On the first day of the race the car achieved a top speed of 140kmh For comparison the Sunraycer the first winner of the Solar Challenge race attained a top speed of 109kmh in 1987

The winner of the North American Solar Challenge from the University of Michigan USA was considered to be one of the most important opponents Other important contestants were the MIT also USA and the Japanese Ashiya University team In 2005 there were also two other European contestants the Dutch Raedthuys Solar Team from the University of Twente and the Belgian Umicore Solar Team from Leuven


This average speed which could lead to maximum speeds of 140kmh speeds on downhill section well exceeding speed limits on the Australian highway has led to rules changes for future races

Skweeze Me Pleeze Me
Skweeze Me Pleeze Me is a song by the British rock band Slade released in 1973 as a nonalbum single It was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea and produced by Chas Chandler It reached No 1 in the UK giving the band their fifth number one single and remained in the charts for ten weeks The song was certified UK Silver by BPI in July 1973 The song would be included on the bands 1973 compilation album Sladest

Earlier in 1973 Slade achieved their fourth number one Cum On Feel the Noize which was also the bands first single to reach the number one spot in its first week This achievement had not been seen since The Beatles Get Back in 1969 While on tour in America the band entered AM Studios in Los Angeles to record the followup single Skweeze Me Pleeze Me Released in June 1973 the song also reached the top spot in its first week It remained at No 1 for three consecutive weeks and sold 300000 copies in its first week of release

Lea originally had the idea for the chorus of Skweeze Me Pleeze Me after visiting the bands regular pub The Trumpet in Bilston where he saw local pianist Reg Kierle performing there During the release of the song drummer Don Powell was involved in a nearfatal car crash in July briefly throwing the bands existence into doubt Despite his critical condition Powell was able to make a recovery and the band entered the studio to record material for their next album Old New Borrowed and Blue later in the year

Skweeze Me Pleeze Me was released on 7 vinyl by Polydor Records in the UK Ireland across Europe Scandinavia Australia New Zealand South Africa Israel Argentina and Japan In America it was released by Reprise Records The Bside Kill Em at the Hot Club Tonite was exclusive to the single and would later appear on the bands 2007 compilation BSides The band had briefly considered releasing the Bside as a novelty single however Powells car crash caused the idea to be scrapped In America the Bside was the Old New Borrowed and Blue album track My Town

Due to Powells car crash no music video was filmed to promote the single The band appeared twice on the UK music show Top of the Pops prior to Powells crash Afterwards the producers of the show would not allow Slade to perform as a threepiece band so future airings of the song showed studio audience dancing to the song instead Prior to Powells crash the band also performed the song along with its Bside on the UK TV show Lift off with Ayesha

Upon release Record Mirror commented on Holders vocals as being given a satisfactory showcase Although they felt the song was not dissimilar to the bands previous material they added that rolling rhythm pushes the whole thing along with alarming verve and gusto New Musical Express said The start is fussy and those whoawhoas in the chorus are a drag The beats strong and the words in the verses are the best yet but all around this doesnt beat Mama Weer All Crazee Now or Gudbuy TJane American magazine Cash Box listed the single as one of their picks of the week during November 1973 They felt the song represented usual hard driving fare from the band and predicted it would give them their first major Stateside hit

Akysis
Akysis is the largest genus of catfishes order Siluriformes of the family Akysidae

In 1996 it was determined that Akysis is the sister group to all other akysids then only including Parakysis Acrochordonichthys and Breitensteinia However it was acknowledged that the genus Akysis was poorlysampled at the time and may be deemed nonmonophyletic in the future

In 1998 it was recognized that the large genus Akysis includes two species groups The first species group was the Akysis variegatus group for species more closely related to the type species the other group was the pseudobagarius group for species more closely related to the formerlynamed Akysis pseudobagarius the authors recognized it as conceivable that the groups represented two genera but tentatively retained the species in a single genus Since then the genus Pseudobagarius was erected for this species group leaving only members of the A variegatus group in the genus Akysis

In 2007 Laguvia manipurensis was redescribed to the genus Akysis as part of the A variegatus group

There are currently 24 recognized species in this genus

These fish are found in fastflowing streams in Southeast Asia This area is bordered by the Irrawaddy River drainage to the west the Barito River drainage to the east the Lancangjiang upper Mekong drainage to the north and the Citarum River drainage to the south Akysis have been reported from Java Sumatra Borneo Tenasserim Thailand Myanmar and most recently the distribution of Akysis has been discovered to include India

These small catfish can be distinguished by their general colouring of yellow markings on a brown background Fishes of the genus Akysis are diagnosed by having tough leathery skin covered with tubercles which are arranged in longitudinal rows along the sides the anterior margin of the pectoral spine with a notch visible dorsally the nasals with expansions beyond the canalbearing teeth and no palatal teeth These fish are distinguished from the members of the genus Pseudobagarius by a number of characteristics these species have a terminal mouth the posterior and anterior nostrils being smaller and located further apart with a distance between the base of the nasal barbel and anterior nostril the anterior nostrils are situated at the tip of a short tube and the caudal fin is truncate or emarginate rathern that forked

The maximum adult size of Akysis species is less than 70millimetres 28in SL

Catfishes of the genus Akysis are small crypticallycoloured species Akysis are small secretive fishes that occupy a variety of habitats Most species typically inhabit clear swiftflowing upland streams with sandy or rocky substrates Some species are reported from the muddy side and main channels and deltas of large rivers In smaller streams they may be found hiding in leaf litter and woody debris in patches of live vegetation such as Cryptocoryne affinis or in shallow riffle areas under coarse gravel or larger stones Species of Akysis also are reported from the shallow margins to the bottom depths of large rivers where they are usually taken in trawls together with decaying vegetation

PiedduCourant Prison
The PiedduCourant Prison is a building in Montreal Quebec near the Saint Lawrence River and the JacquesCartier Bridge

The original plan for a prison in Montreal was designed by Quebec architect George Blaiklock in 1825 to replace the prison at Champ de Mars built in the first decade of the 19th Century but John Wells ultimately designed the building after a prison in Philadelphia likely the Eastern State Penitentiary built in 1829 that was finally opened a decade later The building was built to house over 276 prisoners but held over 1500 prisoners from the 18371838 rebellion The prison operated from 1836 to 1912 as a city prison in Montreal and housed prisoners and hangings following the Lower Canada Rebellion in 1838

The prison was replaced by Bordeaux Prison and was vacant from 1912 to 1921 In 1921 it was acquired by and became the headquarters of the Socit des alcools du Qubec the provincialowned liquor board in Quebec

The main prison building was altered with the Gable roof on the front of centre block removed a fourth floor added replacing roofing and new wing added to the rear by SAQ The west wall in the front was demolished leaving the gate and east wall intact

It saw the incarceration and execution by hanging of several Patriotes who had fought the Lower Canada Rebellion Because of this it also houses a museum on the history of the Patriotes and a gathering is usually held there on National Patriote Day Upon the front of its site is found the Monument aux Patriotes by sculptor Alfred Lalibert The whole of Pierre Falardeaus film February 15 1839 happens at the Prison

The monument is located in the Place of the Patriots which is in front of the Socit des alcools du Qubec offices and the site of the old PiedduCourant Prison

The work of Alfred Lalibert the Monument aux Patriotes was unveiled on June 24 1926 On each its three faces a carved bronze medallion represents patriots Chevalier de Lorimier LouisJoseph Papineau and Wolfred Nelson

Sikandar Bagh
Sikandar Bagh   formerly known by the British as SikunderSikandraSecundra Bagh is a villa and garden enclosed by a fortified wall with loopholes gateway and corner bastions approx 150 yards square c  located in the city of Lucknow Oudh Uttar Pradesh India It was built by the last Nawab of Oudh Wajid Ali Shah 18221887 as a summer residence The name of the villa signifies Garden of Sikandar perhaps after Alexander the Great whose name lives on in this form in these parts compare Alexandria Egypt in Arabic 
AlIskandariya or perhaps after Sikandar Mahal Begum the Nawabs favourite wife It was stormed in 1857 by the British during the Indian Rebellion and witnessed within its walls the slaughter of all 2200 sepoy mutineers who had made it a stronghold during their Siege of Lucknow The site now houses the National Botanical Research Institute of India

The garden was laid out in about 1800 as a royal garden by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan It was later improved upon by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah the last native ruler of Oudh during the first half of the 19th century who used it as his summer villa The garden has a small pavilion in the middle which was likely the scene of innumerable performances of the Raslilas and Kathak dances music and poetic mehfils and other cultural activities which the last Nawab had a great appreciation for indeed possibly too great a one as history has judged him to have been overfond of his leisure interests

During the Indian Rebellion the Sikander Bagh was used as one of many strongholds of sepoy mutineers during their siege of the British Residency in Lucknow It stood in the way of the CommanderinChief Sir Colin Campbells planned route to relieve the besieged Residency 

On the morning of 16 November 1857 whilst passing by its eastern side in a southerly direction in a sunken lane the British force was surprised and stopped in its tracks by overwhelmingly heavy fire coming from the Sikander Bagh A staff officer remarked to a comrade If these fellows allow one of us to get out of this culdesac alive they deserve every one of them to be hanged The cavalry were jammed together unable to advance and the high banks on either side seemed to offer an impassable barrier to artillery However Blunt of the Bengal Horse Artillery led his troop and conquering the impossible brought them with their guns into an open space to the east of the Sikandar Bagh galloping through enemy fire Here he unlimbered with remarkable coolness and selfpossession The six guns opened fire on the Sikandar Bagh Sappers and miners demolished part of the earth banks which allowing two 18pounder heavy guns of Traverss battery of the Artillery Brigade to be brought up out of the lane After half an hour of bombardment from a range of only  an aperture was created in the southeast angle of the wall in a brickedup doorway an ugly blind hole about square and off the ground Although only large enough to admit a single man with difficulty it was immediately rushed under heavy fire by some of the 93rd Highlanders and some men of the 4th Punjab Infantry 4th PI under Lieutenant McQueen 14 managing to enter the Sikaddar Bagh 

At the same time the rest of the 4th PI under Lieutenant Paul assaulted the gateway The gate was in the process of being closed by the mutineers when Subadar Mukarab Khan 4th PI a Pathan of Bajaur one of the leading men of the attack thrust his left arm and shield between its folds thus preventing it being shut and barred Though his left arm was wounded he still managed to keep his shield between the folds by holding it with his right hand until the door was forced This took place whilst Lt McQueens party and some of the Highlanders who had entered by the breach came from the rear of the many defenders of the gateway After a long handtohand struggle the British forced their way in greater numbers into the Sikandar Bagh through the gate and through the breach which had been enlarged by the sappers Slowly forced back the main body of about 2000 mutineers took refuge in a large 2storied building and the highwalled enclosure behind it The 2 doors to the enclosure were assaulted by the 4th PI Lt McQueen led the assault against the right gate and Lt Willoughby tackled the left The defenders had expected an attack from the opposite quarter and had bricked up the door to their rear and in doing so blocked their retreat After a long struggle they were all slain no quarter being given With cries such as Cawnpore You bloody murderers it was clear that the British attackers blamed these mutineers for the slaughter of European civilians earlier in the Mutiny including women and children particularly during the Siege of Cawnpore which caused outrage throughout British India and in Britain Lord Roberts who witnessed the assault later recalled Inch by inch they were forced back to the pavilion and into the space between it and the north wall where they were all shot or bayoneted There they lay in a heap as high as my head a heaving surging mass of dead and dying inextricably entangled It was a sickening site one of those which even in the excitement of battle and the flush of victory make one feel strongly what a horrible side there is to war The wounded men could not get clear of their dead comrades however great their struggles and those near the top of this ghastly pile vented their rage and determination on every British officer who approached by showering upon him abuse of the foulest description

Those killed or wounded during the assault included 9 officers and 90 men of the 93rd Highlanders and 3 officers and 69 men from the 4th Punjabi Infantry

Key 1 Position of 18pounder guns 2 Breach made in wall 3 Gateway 4 Bastion stormed from inside by 4th Punjab Infantry Regt cutting off enemys retreat 5 Centre pavilion with verandah 6 Onestoried building overlooking whole garden with own courtyard behind 7 East bastion exploded killing Lt Paul in command of 4th PI 8 Spot occupied by Sir Colin Campbell CinC and Staff from 18 to 22 November

After the fighting the British and loyal native Punjab Infantry dead were buried in a deep trench Later elephants were used to drag the corpses of the mutineers out of the Sikandar Bagh where they were slightly covered over in a ditch which they themselves had recently dug outside the north wall in order to strengthen the defences

The 4th Punjab Infantry remained quartered in the Sikandar Bagh until Lucknow was evacuated by the British 11 days later on 27 November while the CommanderinChief and his staff occupied a site to the west of the gate under the south wall from 18 to 22 November 

In early 1858 Felice Beato photographed the Sikandar Bagh showing skeletal remains strewn across the grounds of the interior These were apparently disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photographs dramatic impact

It is said that more Victoria Crosses were awarded for that single day than ever many for the assault on the Sikandar Bagh 
The recipients were as follows


Sgt Samuel Hill and Major John Guise  for going to the aid of wounded elected by the regiment





Articles such as cannonball swords and shields parts of muskets and rifles dug out of the garden over the years are now displayed in the NBRI Exhibition and scars from cannonball on the old walls of the garden still bear witness to the event

Another visible reminder of the battle is the statue erected some years ago in the old campus of the garden of Uda Devi a Pasi a Dalit community lady who fought side by side with the besieged mutineers Attired in male battle dress she had perched herself atop a tree in the garden gun in hand and kept the British attackers at bay until her ammunition was exhausted upon which she dropped dead to the ground her body riddled with bulletsAs far as the legend goes Uda Devi was one of the female bodyguards of Nawab Wajid Ali ShahShe was fiercely dedicated to her master Trained in martial Arts and espionage she also learned the art of guerrilla warfare and fought with her gun till the last bullet The British were also surprised and stunned by her marksmanship until she was spotted by the soldiers who fired relentlessly at her till she died from her wounds

Giulio Cesare Polerio
Giulio Cesare Polerio c 1550 Lanciano  c 1610 Rome reconstruction of places and dates by Adriano Chicco was an Italian chess theoretician and player

Name affixes used for him are lApruzzese Giuolio Cesare da Lanciano SalvioWalker and Lancianese because he was born in Lanciano a town in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region of Italy

The first printed matter in which the name Giulio Cesare da Lanciano occurs is the socalled Il Puttino of Alessandro Salvio first published in 1634 The story recounted in Il Puttino must have occurred around 1575 thus published by Salvio some 60 years later Il Puttino altramente detto il Cavaliere errante is a nickname used by Alessandro Salvio for Giovanni Leonardo According to Alessandro Salvio Giulio Cesare da Lanciano accompanied Giovanni Leonardo on his way to Madrid until Genoa

After returning to Rome around 1584 Polerio became a chess player and writer in ordinary of Giacomo Boncompagni Duke of Sora and son of Pope Gregory XIII born Ugo Boncompagni

Polerio wrote a number of codexes in which a lively international chess is described exchanges of ideas among Italy Portugal and Spain In these codexes besides of own and new ideas in chess openings some matches played by himself are noted by the hand of Polerio

In the Puttino Salvio mentions that starting in 1606 from Citt di Piazza after a long travel on his way to Rome p43  p44 il detto Signor Cascio poi andando a Roma vinse Giulio Cesare compagno del Puttino il primo a Roma in casa dellEccelenza del Sig Giacobo Buoncompagno Duca di Sora this Mr Geronimo Cascio on his way to Rome beat Giulio Cesare Polerio companion of Il Puttino the best in Rome in the housecourt of his Excellence Giacomo Boncompagni Duke of Sora

The first systematic investigation of the Codexes of Polerio was published by Antonius van der Linde in 1874 The subject of the investigations by Van der Linde can be found at the Bibliotheca Van der LindeNiemeijeriana part of the Koninklijke Bibliotheek National Library of the Netherlands

The current systematics of the Codexes of Polerio has been performed and published by Alessandro Sanvito in 2005

The systematic organisation of overall seven Codexes described and called AG by Van der Linde and attributed to Polerio in 1874 had major impact on the further description of chess history and history of chess theory A relevant part of the work of Van der Linde was to compare Codexes of Polerio and Gioacchino Greco even superfine According to this investigation most of the analytic work of Polerio was mediated outside of Italy up to 1874 via Gioacchino Greco The clue which potentially could link both chess players may be seen in the person Giacomo Boncompagni or the Duchy of Sora respectively

On p186 of Das Schachspiel des XVI Jahrhunderts van der Linde wrote in 1874

6 Dd1f3 e cosi ancor che habbia perso un pezzo resta con buonissima postura di poter uencere il gioco sapendo guidarlo  presso il che sarebbe superfluo inogni modo se si uolesse mostrare la fine di tutti giochi e per questo basta insino  un certo che tanto che si conosca apartemente il uantagio del gioco si come per la postura di dette giochi ogni giudicioso giocatore lo potr facilmente cognoscere

 in modern terms

Polerio Gambit 1 e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3 Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 gxf3 6Qxf3 

Exactly this move order was also found later even in a second Polerio Codex discovered and described by JA Leon in 1894
Of note is that the position after 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 gxf3 6Qxf3 may be considered by most recent grandmasters as a forced win for White  provided that 500 would mean free castling ie bringing the White King from e1 to h1 Actually Polerio did claim 500 gxf3 6Qxf3 to be favourable for White although the white king of Polerio did stand after 500 on h1 but not on g1 ie castling as defined in our days

However in 1874 the move order 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 was already occupied by the term Muzio Gambit This term derives from a translation of a work of Alessandro Salvio supposedly the third book of the reprint of 1723 by Sarrat in 1813 On page 209 Jacob Henry Sarratt translated and wrote

SALVIO states that the following Gambit was sent to him by Signor Muzio 

Actually Alessandro Salvio never stated this Rather in the third book of the Il Puttino he wrote that Signor Mutio dAlessandro did see that Geronimo Cascio did play the move order with free castling also called Italian method of castling

With p 165 vol 2 of the 1821 edition of A New Treatise of the Game of Chess the term Muzio Gambit was coined by Jacob Henry Sarratt And with the latter work of Sarrat in 1821 the modern theory of the Muzio Gambit with castling according modern rules started  an idea and a position already Polerio analysed in 157980

Thus Antonius van der Linde changed the view on the historical development of the move order 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 in 1874 most notably in the last editions of the Handbuch Thereafter a trend can be seen to call this move order either with hyphenated terms such as MuzioPolerio PolerioMuzio or simply Polerio Gambit Such a terminology is both in honour of Giulio Cesare Polerio and partially misleading since the major body of the theory of this opening was generated in the time span inbetween 1821 and 1874 The number of games played by Adolf Anderssen Paul Morphy and Wilhelm Steinitz with 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 g4 500 or 5d4 in the time span 18211874 was already rather high The rules for Chess opening nomenclature and their historical development should be taken into account while assessing van der Lindes claim of 1874 D PolerioGambit

In 1874 Van der Linde suggested as well p188 to rename the move order 1e4 e5 2f4 exf4 3Nf3 g5 4Bc4 Bg7 5h4 h6 6d4 d6 7Nc3 c6 8hxg5 hxg5 9Rxh8 Bxh8 10Ne5 into Polerios second Gambit This suggestion is based on the observation that im Handbuch 1864 S 366  3 this move order is called das Gambit des Calabresen This is a rather interesting observation since in the Handbuch in its 2nd edition as of 1852 on p 205 it is mentioned that the move order 1e4 e5 2Bc4 f5 can be found at the Calabrese Thats a rather wise wording since both 1e4 e5 2Bc4 f5 and 1e4 e5 2Nf3 f5 according to Codexes of Polerio occurred in games of Gio Leonardo games 236238 p190 in van der Linde Both Giovanni Leonardo and Gioacchino Greco derived from Calabria the first from Cutro the second from Celico

Bluestar bus company
Solent Blue Line Ltd which trades primarily under the name Bluestar is a bus operator providing services in south Hampshire It is a subsidiary of the Go South Coast sector of the GoAhead Group

Solent Blue Line was formed by Southern Vectis in May 1987 to compete with Southampton Citybus on some of its major routes with some Bristol VRTs

In October 1987 Solent Blue Line purchased the Hants  Sussex business from Basil Williams and the Eastleigh and Southampton routes which had previously been part of Hants  Dorset from Stagecoach in Hampshire This expanded the fleet from 16 to 115 buses New buses began to be purchased with Leyland Olympians for the Southampton to Winchester service and minibuses for the Eastleigh to Winchester service Some services were operated under franchise by Brijan Tours and Marchwood Motorways

From here the network expanded until in 2003 the network underwent a change involving a new name and the launch of the Bluestar brand soon after as a name for their premier services with Bluestar services one and two launching in 2004 the three and four service launching a year later and the Waterside services eight and nine having fully launched by 2006

In July 2005 Solent Blue Line was included in the sale of Southern Vectis to the GoAhead Group and subsequently the head office functions of the company were consolidated with those of the other Go South Coast companies Southern Vectis and Wilts  Dorset in Poole In October 2006 Solent Blue Line purchased Marchwood Motorways

After the withdrawal of the Red Rocket brand on 25 February 2008 most of the companys services began to run under the Bluestar brand The fleet has recently undergone several updates including the introduction of a smartcard system called the key the introduction of free WiFi internet to all buses and USB charging points

As of 22 June 2017 all Bluestar and Unilink buses accept contactless payment as part of a 16m investment from Hampshire County Council

The company itself holds the original name of Solent Blue Line however none of the buses it operates use this branding the last few buses using this branding was incorporated into the Bluestar network in 2008 As a result a number of sub brands are used for the bus services

Bluestar was originally launched in 2004 running the main routes with destinations outside of Southampton However since 2008 the service has become the main brand for the company The vast majority of these services terminate in Southampton with the exception of services 7 Sholing  Woolston  City Centre  Shirley  Millbrook  General Hospital  Lordshill and 18 Thornhill  Bitterne  Northam  City Centre  Shirley  Millbrook which go through the city and service 5 Boyatt Wood  Eastleigh  North Baddesley  Romsey thus not going near the city centre In addition to these services Services 1 2 3 4 6 8 9 11 12 16 and 17 also operate under the Bluestar brand

The Nightstar services used to run on Friday and Saturday nights and were aimed at people who had a night out in Southampton All services began at Leisure World Southampton and made their way past other large clubs before completing its route These routes generally followed those of their daytime number counterparts with additional stops to take into account destinations served by other routes In January 2013 all but the Unilink U1N ceased to run due to council funding cuts

The QuayConnect shuttle service runs a service around the city of Southampton stopping at Southampton Central railway station Westquay Shopping Centre and Town Quay for the Hythe Ferry and the Red Funnel ferries to the Isle of Wight The service was started as CityLink under the previous operator Enterprise but the operation was taken over by Bluestar on 28 September 2008 and rebranded as QuayConnect in May 2016 with new livery of red and white featuring the newest Red Jet which came into service for Red Funnel shortly after Originally the two buses used on the service were inherited from Enterprise and were repainted in a new twotone blue livery with the interiors rebranded Originally the service was free to use for all passengers but a change in May 2014 saw a 1 single fare introduced to all passengers except Red Funnel ticket holders who remain entitled to free travel The frequency of the service was also cut down to every 30 minutes but with a duplicate bus running on some morning services and a 15minute frequency between 47pm or when local events take place in Southampton or the Isle of Wight such as Cowes Week or Bestival

The Unilink service is run under contract by Bluestar on behalf of the University of Southampton

The contract was extended for a further ten years in December 2017 and the company ordered 32 new buses for the Unilink fleet

The New Forest Tour is a circular opentop bus service running around the New Forest between Lyndhurst Brockenhurst Lymington Beaulieu and Exbury

It commenced in 2004 using distinctively branded yellow and orange Bristol VRs in the same livery as the old Southern Vectis opentop services The service was reversed in 2005 to run in the opposite direction For the 2006 season two lowfloor East Lancs Myllennium bodied Volvo B7TLs from Wilts  Dorset were used retaining the Wilts  Dorset livery but with New Forest Tour vinyls added In 2007 the buses passed to Solent Blue Line and were repainted in a new green and orange livery with ponies on the side Again this is similar to the Southern Vectis livery which that company uses on their opentop buses

Between 2008 and 2010 Bluestar used Baby Bluestar branding for their local services There have been twelve Baby Bluestar services of which the H1 H2 H3 P1 T1 and T2 all still run albeit under the Bluestar name Five of the other services have since been dropped and reverted to the normal Bluestar services

Red Rocket was launched on 3 September 2006 as a high frequency network centred on Eastleigh extending to Winchester in the north and HambleleRice in the south Red Rocket services were either withdrawn or rebranded to Baby Bluestar on 24 February 2008 to enable Solent Blue Line to trade under the Bluestar name

There were originally eight Red Rocket routes lettered to avoid confusion with the Bluestar and Solent Blue Line service in operation at the time

The Solent Shuttle was an express bus link that ran between Portsmouth and Southampton The service itself was established in 1976 as a joint venture between Hants  Dorset and Southdown Motor Services between passing on to other operators including Southampton City Bus First Hampshire  Dorset and TellingsGolden Miller First branded the services as the 727 and the 747 while TellingsGolden Miller branded it the Solent Clipper under the service names the X27 and the X47

Solent Blue Line took over the service but ran into difficulties following the cessation of funding from Portsmouth and Southampton City Councils The service was due to close on 2 June 2007 but by popular demand and with the support of pensioners associations in both cities the service continued on a twohourly basis However the service was ceased two years later on 21 February 2009

The Beep Bus service operated between Eastleigh Boyatt Wood Velmore and Southampton between 8 October 2008 and February 2009 The service operated in direct competition with the rival Velvet B service operating on the same route and timetabled three minutes behind those of the Beep bus Initially the service was registered with VOSA as a Wilts  Dorset route to begin on 15 September 2008 but this was later cancelled and replaced with an identical Bluestar registration The service began a full week before its registration date to match the start date of Velvets service but was unable to take fares and so operated as a free service until their start date a week later Normal fares were slightly lower than Velvets on some journeys but local journeys were more expensive Bluestar operations director Andrew Wickham said that the decision was a business decision pure and simple adding that they are not scared of competition but Velvet were deliberately creaming off some of their passengers The rival Velvet service ended on 10 January 2009 because of low passenger numbers Soon after Bluestar announced their intention to withdraw Beep Bus from February 2009 ironically one year after they withdrew the Red Rocket B service

The Do the Docks tour was an opentop bus tour of Southampton docks using opentop buses from the New Forest Tour and a debranded Wilts  Dorset Leyland Olympian The service changed on 29 July 2007 as a result of low passenger numbers following poor weather during the 2007 summer season with the service losing its turn up and hop on format and becoming a chartered service The route saw a brief reprieve in April 2008 when the service ran for two days on 26 and 27 of that month as part of the Caribbean festival in Southampton As Solent Blue Line no longer had the opentop buses for the routes a hired Southern Vectis opentop bus was used

In March 2007 whilst being used as a railreplacement bus a doubledecker member of the Red Rocket fleet drove under a low bridge at Barnham causing the top to be ripped off in addition to minor damage to the bridge It is now with Southern Vectis as an opentopper A similar incident occurred at Romsey in May 2015 when a doubledecker bus had its roof removed after colliding with a railway bridge

In July 2009 the MP for Eastleigh Chris Huhne asked for an investigation into allegations of anticompetitive behaviour of Bluestar against Velvets over their implementation and subsequent removal of extra services which operated between Eastleigh and Fair Oak to rival Velvets service the Fair Oak Flyer

In the early hours of 22 March 2011 there was an incident between a car and a Bluestar bus on route 2 between Southampton Eastleigh and Fair Oak resulting in a single fatality of the car driver and the passenger last known to be in a critical condition Only one passenger of the 10 onboard were treated for minor injuries

At around 1630 on 7 February 2012 a Marchwood Motorways MercedesBenz Citaro caught fire on Calmore Roundabout Totton The bus was being driven Not In Service by a mechanic at the time  there were no injuries but the bus was destroyed

The Knoxville Girl
The Knoxville Girl is an Appalachian murder ballad

It is derived from the 19thcentury Irish ballad The Wexford Girl itself derived from the earlier English ballad The Bloody Miller or Hanged I Shall Be about a murder in 1683 at Hogstow Mill 12 miles south of Shrewsbury This ballad was collected by Samuel Pepys who wrote about the murder of Anne Nichols by the Mills apprentice Francis Cooper Other versions are known as the Waxweed Girl The Wexford Murder These are in turn derived from Elizabethan era poem or broadside ballad The Cruel Miller

Possibly modelled on the 17th century broadside William Grismonds Downfall or A Lamentable Murther by him Committed at Lainterdine in the county of Hereford on March 12 1650 Together with his lamentation sometimes known as The Bloody Miller

poem
I met a little girl in Knoxville a town we all know well
And every Sunday evening out in her home Id dwell
We went to take an evening walk about a mile from town
I picked a stick up off the ground and knocked that fair girl down

She fell down on her bended knees for mercy she did cry
Oh Willy dear dont kill me here Im unprepared to die
She never spoke another word I only beat her more
Until the ground around me within her blood did flow

I took her by her golden curls and I drug her round and around
Throwing her into the river that flows through Knoxville town
Go down go down you Knoxville girl with the dark and rolling eyes
Go down go down you Knoxville girl you can never be my bride

I started back to Knoxville got there about midnight
My mother she was worried and woke up in a fright
Saying dear son what have you done to bloody your clothes so
I told my anxious mother I was bleeding at my nose

I called for me a candle to light myself to bed
I called for me a handkerchief to bind my aching head
Rolled and tumbled the whole night through as troubles was for me
Like flames of hell around my bed and in my eyes could see

They carried me down to Knoxville and put me in a cell
My friends all tried to get me out but none could go my bail
Im here to waste my life away down in this dirty old jail
Because I murdered that Knoxville girl the girl I loved so well

<doc id="7724855" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7724855" title="Elene">
Elene
Elene is a poem in Old English that is sometimes known as Saint Helena Finds the True Cross It was translated from a Latin text and is the longest of Cynewulfs four signed poems It is the fifth of six poems appearing in the Vercelli manuscript which also contains The Fates of the Apostles Andreas Soul and Body I the Homiletic Fragment I and Dream of the Rood The poem is the first English account of the finding of the Holy Cross by Saint Helena the mother of Emperor Constantine The poem was written by Cynewulf some time between 750 and the tenth century It is written in a West Saxon dialect but certain Anglianisms and metrical evidence concerning false rhymes suggest it was written in an Anglian rather than Saxon dialect It is 1321 lines long

Cynewulfs signature which is always in runes appears on Christ II Juliana The Fates of the Apostles and Elene The dialect in his poems suggests that he was either Mercian or Northumbrian He was probably most active around the late 8th and early 9th centuries though there is other research to support that he was active between the late 9th and late 10th centuries

Cynewulfs true identity is still unknown but there have been efforts to narrow down the list of possible poets The four most favored candidates are Cynewulf who was the bishop of Lindisfarne in Northumbria in around 783 Cynulf a priest ca 803 Cynewulf the father of Bishop Cyuneweard of Wells who died in 975 and Cenwulf an abbot of Peterborough Abbey in around 1006 There is not enough evidence to support any of these claims

Elene is contained in the Vercelli Book appearing on fol 121a133b

The story is loosely based on historical events and takes place within an anachronistic setting that amalgamates wars of the fourthcentury involving the Romans the Huns and the Franks Elene fits into a subgenre of inventio the search for sacrosanct relics of the saints Cynewulfs source for the legend of St Helenas Finding of the Cross was probably the Acta Cyriaci and a version of it is written in the Acta Sanctorum for May 4

The poem begins with Constantine emperor of Rome riding out to battle the Huns and Hrethgoths He is a mighty king made strong by God though he is not aware of the Christian God yet He sees a vision in the sky and he is told that he will halt his enemies with the symbol that is shown to him by the heavens The battle begins and Constantine reveals the symbol that he was shown a cross The cross sends his enemies running in all directions and they are easily defeated by the Romans

Constantine returns home and addresses an assembly on whether they know the meaning of the symbol that saved his people Only the wisest know that the cross is the symbol of the Lord in Heaven Jesus Christ Constantine is baptized and becomes a devout Christian due to his experience He learns from the Bible how and where Christ was killed so he orders Helen his mother to lead an army to the land of the Jews to find where the true cross is buried She leads an army of men onto a ship and begins the journey to Israel

Once in the city of Jerusalem she calls an assembly of sage Jews and scorns them for having condemned Jesus to death leaving them wondering what they have done to anger the queen Judas tells his fellow Jews that he knows the queen searches for the cross Judas was brought up on Christian teachings and his brother Stephen was stoned to death for being a Christian The Jews refuse to help Helen find the cross so she threatens them with death Frightened they hand over Judas He also refuses to tell her where it is so she locks him in a dark prison for seven days without food On the seventh day he cries out that he cannot take the torture any longer and will reveal where the cross is He leads the queen to the hill where Jesus was crucified

Judas converts to Christianity in a passionate speech to God acknowledging Jesus as his Savior God gives Judas a smoke sign in the sky which convinces him of his newfound belief He digs and finds three crosses A crowd forms but no one knows which of the three was the cross of Christ They set the crosses up in the city hoping that Christ would show them the truth A corpse is brought forth and each cross is held over him The third cross brings him back to life

Satan appears in grotesque form angry that he has had a soul stolen from him Judas cleverly argues with Satan with his new faith but Satan leaves with a threat that he will raise up a king to retaliate Helen sends word home to Constantine who tells her to build a church on the hillside where the crosses were found She encases the true cross in gold and jewels and places it in the church Judas is baptized and puts away his false religion He is appointed to priesthood and is renamed Cyriacus because of his rebirth

Helen then decides she needs to find the nails that held Christ up on the cross Cyriacus searches for them and God again gives him a sign in the form of fire to show where they are buried Helen receives the gift with tears of joy and the Holy Spirit fills her with the gift of wisdom and forever protects the saint She goes to a wise man to find out how she should use the nails and he advises her to use them in the bit of Constantines horse so that he would always be victorious in battle The epilogue of the poem is devoted to the personal reflection of Cynewulf and his interpretation of Doomsday Cynewulf tells of how he has experienced a spiritual metamorphosis His depiction of the Last Judgement resembles a sort of Purgatory where people are divided into three groups two of which undergo cleansing to reach salvation while the third is damned to eternal Hell

Helen is not the typical passive Old English heroine She is strong and autonomous more like the women in Old Norse literature rather than the GraecoRoman saints Old Norse heroines are strong assertive and persuade physically instead of verbally Cynewulf purposely wanted his audience to view Helen as a strong individual He does not include her death in the poem as the Latin version does and he does not have her submitting to Constantine and Cyriacus as she does in the Latin version In fact it is the opposite We see Cyriacus completely submitting himself to Helen hfde Ciriacus  eall gefylled swa him seo ele bebead  wifes willan line 1129b Cyriacus had completely done as the noble woman bade him to do the will of the woman

Helen can be understood as an allegory of the Christian Church and its mission to lead men to salvation through acceptance of the Cross Literally her mission is to find the true cross but allegorically her mission is to evangelize the Jews Helen is referred to as a warrior queen and she has an army of warriors but they never fight The warriors are there to subjugate a powerful enemy which could be Satan or nonbelievers Judas and Helen are an allegory for the relationship of the Church with its members Judass dialogue reveals him to be of the human condition he has the capacity for saintliness and wickedness

AntiSemitism is a topic of discussion for scholars regarding the poem Elenes oppressive tactics towards the Jewish elders are rewarded in the end A Marxist argument can also be made when looking at how Judas eventually submits to his oppressor He arises from the pit as a heroictype figure and it seems the reins of authority Elene exercises only do good in the end It is contended that this justifies the authority of royalty in Cynewulfs time

In terms of symbolism the goodbad dichotomy which is prevalent in Old English verse finds itself in the oppositions of light and dark imagery in the poem For instance it is observed in the poem that Judas spends seven nights in a pit and the darkness can be seen to convey his obstinacy in refusing to see the light of Christianity

Along with alliteration which is a key part to all Old English poetry there are also places in the poem where Cynewulf applies rhyme in order to emphasize certain words such as in the battle scene 5055a
poem
Ridon ymb rofne onne rand dynede
poem
They rode about the famous one then the shield dinned the battletarp clanged the king advanced with a troop a battalion to the battle The raven yelled from above dark and greedy for carrion The troop was on the march The hornbearers ran the heralds called out the horse trod the earth In this example the rhymes emphasize the din of voices and the crash of weapons which builds excitement throughout the battle scene

From 1901 until 1917 Gastev divided his time between exiles escapes and work in Russian or European factories His experience as a factory worker led him to develop a rather practical approach to Marxism Revolution for Gastev meant empowering workers by allowing them to control everyday matters related to workprocesses Gastev became involved in the work of the Petersburg Union of Metal Workers one of the most influential tradeunions in Russia in 1907
In 1908 he got work with the Vasileostovskii Trolley Depot Here he was chosen to monitor wear and tear on the transmission belts and sprockets and analyse the repair process of the trolley cars It was here that he first thought of developoing a science for the social construction of enterprises

In 1910 he was again arrested but when he was sent to Siberia he escaped to Paris where he worked for the motorcar manufacturer ClmentBayard Here he first became familiar with quality assurance which was carried out in a particularly thorough fashion By 1912 he was working for Citron where he witnessed the application of assembly line production which Andr Citron was introducing following a visit to the Ford plant in the United States At that time he became familiar with French Syndicalism and adopted many of the views of that movement seeing trade unions as a chief means of confronting capitalism by bringing concrete improvements into the lives of workers By 1913 Gastev had joined the Circle of Proletarian Culture with Anatoly Lunacharsky Fedor Kalinin Pavel Bessalko and Mikhail Gerasimov In 19171918 Gastev won election as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the newly created AllRussian Union of Metal Workers He actively participated in the 1918 Conference of the Union

In 1920 Gastev became the founder and Director of the Central Institute of Labour CIT  in Moscow which he referred to as his last work of art The organization of the Institute was encouraged by Lenin who promised to allocate the initial funding of the project The institution developed scientific approaches to work management which in practical terms amounted to methods of training workers to perform mechanical operations in the most efficient way Some simple repetitive operations like the cutting of materials with a chisel were studied in great detail Recommendations on setting up the work processes efficiently were published
According to Figes 1996 Gastev As the head of the Central Institute of Labor established in 1920 he carried out experiments to train the workers so that they would end up acting like machines Hundreds of identically dressed trainees would be marched in columns to their benches and orders would be given out by buzzes from machines The workers were trained to hammer correctly by holding a hammer attached to and moved by a hammering machine so that after half an hour they had internalized its mechanical rhythm The same process was repeated for chiseling filing and other basic skills Gastevs aim by his own admission was to turn the worker into a sort of human robot a word not coincidently derived from the Slavic noun robota meaning work Since Gastev saw machines as superior to human beings he thought this would represent an improvement in humanity

Platon Kerzhentsev criticised Gastevs Taylorist approach for adopting a narrow base by focusing on the worker rather than looking at the more general aspects of how production should be organised in a socialist society In 1921 the Central Council of Scientific Organization of Labor SOVNOT was set up with both factions involved In 1924 the AllRussian Scientific Management Conference was held in Moscow where both Gastev and Kerzhentsev argued their case The conference came down on Gastevs side although Kerzhentsev argued that the CIT had wasted three years

In 1928 in an effort to increase the funding of the CIT Gastev organized the Ustanovka Setup as a social enterprise jointstock company which audited the work of industrial enterprises and provided recommendations on efficient organization of their work processes on a commercial basis Here Gastev applied his ideas on education based on his concept of social engineering meaning the creation of training methods based on the physiological and psychological study of humans in the work process using both observational and experimental methods This led to the creation of the setup method   which viewed the conditioning of human faculties as a basis for reform of the educational system in its entirety The term setup  implied the formation of personal automated behaviors through biological setups cultural setups etc Gastevs methods were used in intensive trainings of qualified workers and were highly successful

Gastevs Poeziia rabochego udara Poetry of the workers blow was the first book published by Proletkult in 1918
Most of Gastevs poems may be fairly labeled prose poetry The rhythm is usually not organized enough to qualify for verse the rhyme is absent the poems are written in the form of prose pieces However the use of metaphor lyrical expressiveness and repetitiveness of syntax undoubtedly make Gastev a true lyrical poet with influences ranging from Verhaeren and Walt Whitman to the Russian Futurists

Gastevs poetry energetically celebrates industrialization announcing an era of a new type of human trained by the overall mechanization of everyday life In the 1920s Gastev abandoned his literary work completely dedicating himself to his scientific management research However many of his later publications on nonpoetic topics are written in the expressive language of prose poems

On September 8 1938 Gastev was arrested on false charges of counterrevolutionary terrorist activity He was detained in a Moscow prison and sentenced to death by a speedy trial on April 14 1939 There was no defense attorney and no possibility to appeal against the decision as was common during the Great Purge On April 15 1939 Gastev was shot to death in the suburbs of Moscow

October 1 1941 the date of Gastevs death given by some sources is based on false information given by the authorities to Gastevs family prior to 1991 No reliable information about Gastevs fate after his arrest was available until the KGB archive where the interrogation and trial documents were kept became accessible to relatives in the early 1990s

Gastevs legacy is commemorated by the Gastevs Cup by the Lean Forum Lean Production Professionals InterRegional Public Movement His son Yuri Gastev was prominent soviet mathematician and dissident who eventually emigrated to the USA

Splice the mainbrace
Splice the mainbrace is an order given aboard naval vessels to issue the crew with an alcoholic drink Originally an order for one of the most difficult emergency repair jobs aboard a sailing ship it became a euphemism for authorized celebratory drinking afterward and then the name of an order to grant the crew an extra ration of rum or grog

Braces are the lines that control the angle of the yards On squarerigged ships the mainbrace was the longest line in of all the running rigging It was common to aim for the ships rigging during naval battles If the mainbrace was shot away it was usually necessary to repair it during the engagement the ship was unmaneuverable without it and would have to stay on the same tack Even repairing it after the battle was a difficult job the mainbrace ran through blocks so it could not be repaired with a short splice or a knot Splicing in a large run of hemp was strenuous work and generally the ships best Able Seamen were chosen to carry out the task under the supervision of the Boatswain bosun On completion of the task it was customary for the men to be rewarded with an extra ration of rum The Boatswain would take a sip from the ration of each of the men he had selected for task Eventually the order to splice the mainbrace came to mean that the crew would receive an extra ration of rum and was issued on special occasions after victory in battle the change of a monarch a royal birth a royal wedding or an inspection of the fleet In cases where the whole fleet was to receive the signal it would be run up with a lift of flags or signalled by semaphore
A ration of rum a day was standard issue in the Royal Navy until 1970 when concerns over crew members operating machinery under the influence led to the rum ration being abolished Restrictions were placed on those who could splice the mainbrace any man or officer over the age of 18 who desired to take it received an extra issue of oneeighth of a pint of rum Lemonade was issued those who did not wish for the rum The rum was mixed with water to make grog for all ratings below Petty Officer Only ratings marked G for Grog in the ships books could draw rum grog or lemonade when the mainbrace was spliced and no payment in lieu was available Those under 20 were marked UA for under age in the ships book they were similarly barred from drawing the daily rum ration T stood for Temperance for those of Temperance Movement The issue of rum to wardroom and gunroom officers was stopped in 1881 and ended for warrant officers in 1918 splicing the mainbrace was the only time that officers could be issued with rum
Other navies abolished the grog allowance far earlier the United States Navy after the American Civil War but the order persisted allowing the crew to take another drink in place of rum or grog in 1845 it is recorded as being substituted for the more rowdy Crossing the Line ceremony The Royal New Zealand Navy was the last navy to issue junior and senior ratings a daily tot of rum issuing its last daily rum ration on 1 March 1990 Today the Royal Canadian Navy is more generous with the allowances allowing crew members to take of spirits compared with the allowed by the Royal Navy although the Royal Navy does make allowance for paucity of supplies permitting two cans of beer to be issued if commercial spirits are not available

The order Splice the Mainbrace was still popular with some of the US Navys submarine fleet during WWII On  a skipper on combat patrols in WWII during the boats 8th and 9th missions in 1944 did in fact announce on the 1MC Splice the Mainbrace after each successful attack and sinking of a Japanese ship On Barb s 8th combat patrol the skipper promised the sinking of 5 ships Barb delivered After each sinking the Skipper had a special cake made and each sailor was granted a shot of rot gut whiskey On the 9th patrol the Skipper was able to sneak 24 cases of beer aboard which was distributed after each of Barbs successful attacks

Permission to issue the order to splice the mainbrace is heavily restricted the Royal Navy allows only the Queen a member of the Royal Family or the Admiralty Board to do so the Royal Canadian Navy permits the Queen the Governor General of Canada or the Chief of the Defence Staff to issue it When the Mediterranean fleet received the order from the Prince of Wales the future Edward VIII in 1932 it was the first time it had happened since 1918 it was accompanied by the order to Mend and make clothes another archaic signal which grants the crew a halfday holiday Ships in most of the victorious fleets received the order at the end of the Second World War one ship received the order while still under attack King George VI issued the order in 1949 to the crew of after the Yangtse Incident It was ordered on the day of Queen Elizabeths coronation in 1953 on 29 July 1981 for the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer and of Prince Williams birth on 21 June 1982 when Splice the Mainbrace was celebrated in the Fleet just one week after the end of the Falklands War Nowadays when rum is no longer issued daily the order is somewhat more freely given the Queen issued it after her Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002 after the Trafalgar 200 Fleet Review in 2005 and after her Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012

In Canada the order was most recently given by Queen Elizabeth II on 29 June 2010 at the conclusion of the International Fleet Review for the occasion of the Royal Canadian Navys 100th Anniversary She signalled

The compound form NINDINGIR divine lady or lady of a god from the Akkadian entu denotes a priestess

NIN originated as a ligature of the cuneiform glyphs of MUNUS  and TG  the NIN sign was written as MUNUSTG  in archaic cuneiform notably in the Codex Hammurabi The syllable nin on the other hand was written as MUNUSKA  in Assyrian cuneiform MUNUSKU  NIN  means sister

Ninsun NINSN as the mother of Gilgamesh in the Epic of Gilgamesh standard Babylonian version appears in 5 of the 12 chapters tablets I II III IV and XII The other personage using NIN is the god Ninurta NINURTA who appears in Tablet I and especially in the flood myth of Tablet XI

Of the 51 uses of NIN the other major usage is for the Akkadian word eninna nin as in eninna but also other variants Eninna is the adverb now but it can also be used as a conjunction or as a segueform a transition form

Virginia Museum of Transportation
The Virginia Museum of Transportation is a museum devoted to the topic of transportation located in Downtown Roanoke Virginia US

The Virginia Museum of Transportation began its life in 1963 as the Roanoke Transportation Museum located in Wasena Park in Roanoke Virginia The museum at that time was housed in an old Norfolk  Western Railway freight depot on the banks of the Roanoke River The earliest components of the museums collection included a United States Army Jupiter rocket and the NW J Class Locomotive 611 donated by Norfolk  Western Railway to the city of Roanoke where many of its engines were constructed The museum expanded its collection to include other pieces of rail equipment such as a former DC Transit PCC streetcar and a number of horsedrawn vehicles including a hearse a covered wagon and a Studebaker wagon

In November 1985 a flood nearly destroyed the museum and much of its collection It forced the shutdown of the facility and the refurbishment of 611 In April 1986 the museum reopened in the Norfolk and Western Railway Freight Station in downtown Roanoke as the Virginia Museum of Transportation The museum has earned that title being recognized by the General Assembly of Virginia as the Commonwealths official transportation museum

The locomotives Norfolk  Western 611 and Norfolk  Western 1218 were originally property of the city of Roanoke due to the museums original charter On the April 2 2012 VMTs 50 Birthday the city officially gave the locomotives to the museum

The Norfolk and Western Railway Freight Station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012 The station consists of two clearly identifiable sections both of which were completed in 1918 They are the twostory fiftybaylong freight station proper which was built parallel to the railroad tracks and now is oriented south and the onestorywithbasement brick annex that formerly housed the offices of the Shenandoah and Radford divisions of the Norfolk and Western The building closed for railroad freight business in 1964

Many of the museums antique automobiles are on display here as well The museum also features occasional special exhibits such as the Hollywood Star Cars exhibit which showcased famous cars from the history of television and movies

Ongoing exhibits cover sundry aspects of railroad life in America especially Virginia In addition to these ongoing exhibits the museum maintains an OGauge train layout modeled after Roanoke Salem and Lynchburg Virginia





From January 20 2011 to May 3 the museum was home to Chesapeake and Ohio 614 as part of the museums Thoroughbreds of Steam exhibit
Other pieces include automobiles such as a 1913 Metz a 1920 Buick touring car a Highway Post Office Bus and an armored car used to showcase the United States Bill of Rights in 1991

Though the most prominent pieces of the museums collection are the two Norfolk  Western engines there are more than fifty pieces of rolling stock in the collection Some exhibits may be closed to the public as restoration is in progress on some pieces While most of the railyard is ADAaccessible to view the rolling stock entry into the pieces are not as they were built long before the standards of 1990 Some of the museums collection needs heavy restoration and is stored offsite on a track allowed by Norfolk Southern











The museum is currently seeking exhibits for their aviation gallery while it is under construction

AJS Porcupine
The AJS 500cc Porcupine was a British racing motorcycle built by Associated Motor Cycles AMC which dbuted in 1945 with a horizontalengine designated E90S A later E95 model was developed with an inclinedengine AMC produced AJS and Matchless brands at the time

The motorcycle was originally designed by AJS to be supercharged as were a number of prewar racing bikes but the FICM banned supercharging in 1946 The motor was then worked on to allow it to perform without a supercharger Jock West first rode the machine at the 1947 Isle of Man TT where he experienced teething problems relegating him to a 15th place although he recorded the third fastest lap time of the race Leslie Graham then rode the bike to victory in the inaugural 1949 FIM 500cc world championship This was the only World Championship win for AJS Despite this victory the bike is often cited as unreliable and not living up to its promise

The E90S Porcupine engine was a unit construction aluminium alloy 500cc DOHC twin with horizontal cylinders and heads to give the bike a low centre of gravity A later version of this motor was named the E95 reengineered to have its cylinders inclined at 45 degrees for better cooling and easier carburettor installation and is claimed to have produced 55bhp  7600rpm

The gear drive for the camshafts was on the right of the motor while the gear primary drive was on the left The geared primary drive meant that the motor ran backwards The cam gear drive also drove a jackshaft at the rear of the cylinders which drove an oil pump a fuel pump and via a chain drive a Lucas magneto The fourspeed gearbox output was on the right

As originally designed the E90S was to be supercharged with the blower mounted above the gearbox and driven by the clutch The loss of the supercharger meant that the design was compromised lacking sufficient flywheel effect which caused problems with magneto failure The main initial change was to reduce the valve angle to 90 degrees for a more compact combustion chamber 

It had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors inclined at 49 degrees with an unusual float tank system used rather than float bowls Plain bearings were used for the big end bearings and the centre main bearings The outer main bearings were rollers One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers

The 1947 model engine was mostly made of alloy but as an experiment the head was cast in silver for increased thermal efficiency Due to the softness of silver it had to be alloyed to make it hard enough for racing use By the time this was achieved the thermal efficiency gains were lost and the experiment was abandoned There is dispute as to whether the silver cylinder head went beyond feasibilitystudy stage

The Porcupine used Jampot shocks and Teledraulic race forks The E90 model had an open frame The E95 introduced in 1953 had a loop type frame with the motor mounted lower

Only four E95 Porcupines were built

Team Obsolete have restored a 1954 AJS Porcupine E95 using an exTom Arter MKII motor which features a unique Jack Williams built up roller bearing crankshaft They use it for exhibition and historic racing

Tom Arter put a complete 1954 E95 AJS Porcupine up for auction and it sold for 228620

A 1954 AJS E95 Porcupine was sold postauction at Bonhams in 2011 for 675000 plus fees

The Oxford Book of Carols
The Oxford Book of Carols is a collection of vocal scores of Christmas carols and carols of other seasons It was first published in 1928 by Oxford University Press and was edited by Percy Dearmer Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams It became a widely used source of carols among choirs and church congregations in Britain

Vaughan Williams was a noted composer and arranger of music in the Anglican Church and a founder member of the English Folk Dance and Song Society He was a scholar of English folksong and his music was greatly influenced by traditional folk forms Vaughan Williams had collaborated with Percy Dearmer on the production of the English Hymnal which was published in 1906 and as with this hymnal The Oxford Book of Carols favoured traditional folk tunes and polyphonic arrangements of carols instead of the Victorian hymn tunes that Vaughan Williams considered to be oversentimental and Germanic in tone Vaughan Williams in particular drew on music from his own childhood and his scholarship of English folk music and was driven by his conviction that the music of ordinary people should be valued

The Oxford Book of Carols has been reprinted many times It was reengraved and reset in a slightly larger format in 1964 at which time some of the medieval carols were reedited The most recent impression is dated 26 January 1984 and is still in print

The New Oxford Book of Carols was published in 1992 by OUP Anthologists Hugh Keyte and Andrew Parrott make few references to OBC in their Introduction and their aim appears the same as Dearmers in 1928 The enormous task was shared by both sets of anthologists and Keyte and Parrott issued The Shorter New Oxford Book of Carols in 1993

FranoisMarieThomas Chevalier de Lorimier December 27 1803  February 15 1839 also known under shorter names as FranoisMarieThomas de Lorimier MarieThomas Chevalier de Lorimier or Chevalier de Lorimier was a notary who fought as a Patriote and Frre chasseur for the independence of Lower Canada presentday Quebec in the Lower Canada Rebellion For these actions he was incarcerated at the Montreal PiedduCourant Prison and was hanged at the site by the British authorities

de Lorimier was born in SaintCuthbert Lower Canada 

On January 11 1839 de Lorimier and three of his comrades two of whom managed to escape before being executed the other was Chevrier Bnard appeared before the British Council of War Refused his request for a trial in a civilian court de Lorimier apparently effectively defended himself and challenged the crowns evidence However JeanBaptisteHenri Brien one of his coaccused and terrified of the scaffold signed a confession incriminating de Lorimier and others and the British authorities having failed to seize the main leaders of the rebellion arguably pursued his death to make an example On January 21 de Lorimier and his companions were found guilty of high treason and sentenced to be hanged which took place on February 15 1839 together with Charles Hindelang Amable Daunais Franois Nicolas and PierreRmi Narbonne

The day before de Lorimier wrote his political testament

I die without remorse in the insurrection I only desired the wellbeing and independence from Britain of my country My views and my actions were sincere and were innocent of any of the crimes which dishonor mankind and which are too common when released passions boil up In spite of so many mishaps my heart still keeps its courage and its hopes for the future my children and my friends will see better days Looking tranquilly ahead I am sure that they will win freedom That is what fills me with joy when all around me is sorry and desolation I leave behind me children whose only heritage is the memory of my misfortune Poor orphans it is you who are to be pitied you whom the bloody and arbitrary hand of the law strikes through my death You will have no gentile and affectionate memories of happy days with your father When you are old enough to reflect you will see in your father a man who has paid on the scaffold for actions such as have immortalized other happier men The only crime of your father was his failure

He was executed with such people as the Frenchborn Charles Hindelang His character plays a notable role in Pierre Falardeaus film February 15 1839 about the incarceration and execution of the Patriotes de Lorimier Avenue honours his memory in Montreal

Courage UK
Courage UK is a Christian ministry for the gay and lesbian community based in Guildford Surrey England It was founded as an Evangelical Christian exgay organisation that sought to change gay people to straight but subsequently rejected the idea that sexual orientation could or should be changed and now exists as a progay evangelical Christian ministry

The membership of Courage UK in 2006 has been stated to be about 150 men

Courage UK was founded in February 1988 by Jeremy Marks The group used to be affiliated with the exgay movement and was once a member of Exodus International In 2002 the organisation abandoned those views and its affiliation with the exgay movement At the time of its founding the groups efforts were considered progressive because it reached out to gay people rather than condemning them to hell

By 2000 Jeremy Marks and the leadership of Courage UK recognised a change was needed The expectation of the exgay teaching did not equal the results they saw Gay participants trying to become straight through the organisation became severely depressed and attempted suicide Marks observed that only those who accepted that they were gay and found a partner were happy and successful The teaching that gay people must get into a heterosexual relationship or remain celibate now seemed questionable to Marks This was not only from an experiential viewpoint but also from a theological change In 2001 Jeremy Marks wrote in the journal Lesbian and Gay Christians I have come to the conclusion that we have been quite wrong to dismiss all same sex love other than platonic as sinful the groups change of position was motivated by the belief that the Bible says man should not be alone and that a loving God would not deny gay people the opportunity to love

Marks comments on the Courage UK website clarify the groups change of course

A Change of Heart is the Priority
While recognising the social pressure to become normal ie heterosexual fifteen years experience revealed that Gods primary concern is not to change the sexual orientation of his gay and lesbian disciples but to help them find wholeness in Christ  becoming secure assured of his love and acceptance set apart to follow Jesus faithfully and responsible in building relationships with one another
As a direct result of the New Approach Courage took a sabbatical from Exodus International Courage was also forced to resign from the Evangelical Alliance

Christ II
Christ II also called The Ascension is one of Cynewulfs four signed poems that exist in the Old English vernacular It is a fivesection piece that spans lines 440866 of the Christ triad in the Exeter Book folios 14a20b and is homiletic in its subject matter in contrast to the martyrological nature of Juliana Elene and Fates of the Apostles Christ II draws upon a number of ecclesiastical sources but it is primarily framed upon Gregory the Greats Homily XXIX on Ascension Day

The poem is assigned to a triad of Old English religious poems in the Exeter Book known collectively as Christ Christ comprises a total of 1664 lines and deals with Christs Advent Ascension and Last Judgment It was originally thought to be one piece completed by a single author but the poem is now broken up into three parts

The poem Christ was originally thought to be one piece completed by a single author Almost all scholars now break the poems into three parts Christ I is focused on Advent Christ II on the Ascension and Christ III primarily dealing with Doomsday The poems are the first items in the Exeter Book which is a rather large manuscript that has 123 some sources argue 131 folios contained in it The Exeter Book has been at the Exeter Cathedral Library since 1072 where it was donated by Bishop Leofric No one is exactly positive where the Exeter Book originated Some argue it was written in a monastic institution in Exeter in the 7th century while others state it originated in Canterbury or Glastonbury The book contains 123 leaves or 246 pages with a few random missing pages because the book was unbound for a long period of time Many other pages have holes from burns cuts by a knife and stains by a pot of liquid 
Christ is the longest poem by far in the book if one looks at it as an entirety Christ II has some similar themes to the rest of the Christ poem but it is also very different All three poems have a unique identity and narrative voice that differs from the others Christ II is clearly based on the 29th homily that Pope Gregory the Great wrote Pope Gregory the Great was well known for being the father of Roman Christianity in England believed to have started the constitution of liturgy and the compilation of musical servicesongbooks used in the church Gregory focused the end section of his homily on why angels didnt wear white robes at the Incarnation but did at the Ascension

Cynewulf receives credit for writing Christ II but his inspiration came from the 23rd Psalm and a homily written by Pope Gregory Cynewulf is one of the two only named AngloSaxon poets His name is found as Cyniwulf Cynewulf and Cynwulf he is also responsible for at least Christ II Juliana The Fates of the Apostles and Elene Scholars believe that Cynewulf did not write before 750 because he used an e instead of an i which was not established until that time Most would assume that he was not writing after the 10th century either Some research showed that Cynewulfs Elene corresponded with a portion of a book that was dedicated to Charlemagne as Emperor around 800 Even though there are no certain dates to when Cynewulf lived or the Exeter Book was compiled there is a general theory about when they were inspired

Cynewulf has been greatly studied by scholars to figure out where he exactly lived as well Some think Cynewulf is from Dunwich because he knew a lot about the sea but there has never been any hard evidence that verified any of these hypotheses It has been suggested that Cynewulf was a thegn or retainer to a lord at probably a younger point in his life and he certainly did not come from noble birth Cynewulf positively learned the Latin rudiments so many assume that he probably attended the Minster School of York Most people would also believe that he was either a monk or a priest and possibly even both He was a normal orthodox believer of his time who agreed with Gregory the Great on everything except for Purgatory Cynewulf praised the Trinity as being three separate but combined parts thought sinners may obtain a pardon from hell if they repent and turn from their sins and assumed saints could intercede in earthly matters

Cynewulfs identity is still largely unknown but we can be positive that he placed his signature in four separate poems Cynewulf signed his poems using runes which come from the Germanic alphabet that AngloSaxons used before switching to the Roman alphabet A rune can stand for an actual letter or for the word of its name The first rune cenc stands for torch while yry represents bow These words are sometimes substituted in order to make more grammatical sense so it can be extremely difficult to search and find Cynewulfs signature At the end of The Fates of the Apostles Cynewulf signs his names F W U L C Y N It is assumed that he did this to show that he was a sinner like everyone else or to relate to the Biblical idea that the last shall be first

Christ II begins by stating how important it is for men to seek out the truth and where it came from Christ was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem After he was crucified and rose from the dead he spent forty days on earth before ascending back to heaven Before Christ left he said to gathered people Rejoice in spirit I shall never leave you but I shall always continue in love towards you and give you power and remain with you for ever and ever so that by my grace you will never be wanting in virtue 
After Christ had given his speech a large number of angels appeared above the temple They asked the people why they were just standing around and waiting The angels explained to the people that they were there to escort Christ back to his home in heaven The people were warned to be ready for the time when Christ would return to judge everyone for the deeds that they have committed The clouds surrounded Jesus and the angels and joy rang out throughout all of heaven But the people who had just witnessed this were very sad because of their loss Men and women were crying and everyones hearts were heavy 
It is extremely important that we praise God for all the blessings he has bestowed on us People need to thank the Lord for food possessions weather and shelter along with the sun and moon Praise needs to be given for the dew and rain which supply the earth Most of all God needs to be thanked for the salvation that he freely gives us a chance to have Now we no longer need to suffer in the pain and misery we once had 
Long ago the prophet Job called the Lords son a bird who would not be understood by many people The bird flew from his home and came to earth in human form After all of his work had been done by the grace of God he flew ascended back to his home in heaven There the Lord created mansions for his people He also instilled wisdom in the minds of his followers and gave others the gift of singing The Lord also blessed some with skilled fingers for playing the harp or the ability to write down languages He stands as an upright tree that one can cling to in a time of need The Lord is willing to give man many gifts including wisdom if he can cast his own pride aside 
After Christ had returned to heaven many of his church followers faced tough oppression Pagan governments were in charge and they didnt allow them to worship The pagans destroyed and burned Gods temple and killed many The Lord will redeem His people and all the problems that they have faced King Solomon gives hope to the people when he sang the Lord will garland the hills and heights with his glory he will redeem the world all earths inhabitants by that glorious spring
The poem then focuses on the six leaps that Christ has already made His first leap se forma hlyp was when he descended to the earth through the Virgin Mary The second spring se oer stiell was when he was born in the manger His third leap se ridda hlyp Christ ascended the cross he on rode astag His fourth spring se feora stiell was when he abandoned the cross he one beam ofgeaf and entered the tomb His fifth leap se fifta hlyp was when he went to hell before his resurrection The sixth leap se siexta hlyp was when the Lord ascended into the heavens with the joyous jubilation of the angels The motif of Christs leaps derives from Pope Gregorys Twentyninth Homily on the Gospels or Ascension Homily of Homiliae XL in euangelia The motif is a mystical interpretation of the Song of Solomon Canticles 28 and is found as early as the third century in the work of Hippolytus 
On earth our Father travelled from place to place and leaped from hillside to mountainside We must act in accordance so that we may make the same ascension that He did Men need to believe that the Son and Savior will return to take us from this place Therefore we need to turn from our evil ways and desires Men need to be constantly aware that our enemy Satan is looking for a chance to penetrate us with one of his arrows Pray that the Lord will keep the enemy far away and shield us from him 
The time will come when Christ will return to judge us for the lives that we have lived He will be harsh on those who have not kept the commands in his books It is important to pay attention to your soul and what state it is in because the Lord will return with his legions of angels When he does return He will be rigorous angry and righteous This will be the greatest terror that anyone has ever seen on this earth Men must focus on their souls appearance because Christ is coming to judge both the loved and the loathed

Yumen Pass
Yumen Pass  or Jade Gate or Pass of the Jade Gate is the name of a pass of the Great Wall located west of Dunhuang in todays Gansu Province of China During the Han dynasty 202 BC  AD 220 this was a pass through which the Silk Road passed and was the one road connecting Central Asia and China the former called the Western Regions Just to the south was the Yangguan pass which was also an important point on the Silk Road

Although the Chinese guan is usually translated simply as pass its more specific meaning is a frontier pass to distinguish it from an ordinary pass through the mountains Yumen guan  and Yang guan  are derived from yu   jade  men   gate door and yang   sunny side south side of a hill north side of a river and guan   frontierpasses These were the two most famous passes leading to the north and west from Chinese territory During the Early Han  a defensive line was established from Jiuquan Wine Springs in the Gansu Corridor west to the Jade Gate Pass at its end 

It is not to be confused with the city Yumen  literally Jade Gate in Gansu China Although both are within the same Jiuquan prefecturelevel city a multicounty administrative unit of Gansu province Yumen Pass is located some 400km to the west of its namesake city

Pink Pistols
The Pink Pistols are a gay gun rights organization in the United States and Canada Their motto is Pick on someone your own caliber

Inspired by a Saloncom article written by Jonathan Rauch Krikket aka Doug Krick a libertarian activist from Illinois while living in Massachusetts founded the Pink Pistols in July 2000 The organization had at least 45 chapters as of October 2014 Those chapters are located in 33 states and three countries that are principally made up of gunowning LGBT individuals though neither status is mandatory for membership

The political orientation of the Pink Pistols is considered unusual due to the popular perception in the United States of firearms ownership as a conservative issue and sexuality as a liberal issue However there is nothing within either of these two single issues that is mutually exclusive and a variety of other progun organizations exist for groups not typically associated with gun rights for example the Democrats for the Second Amendment

Pink Pistols activities include firing range visits and political activism The group occasionally produces report cards on politicians rating their position on issues of interest to members According to pinkpistolsorg

The Pink Pistols symbol consists of an overhead view of a pictoperson aiming a handgun in an isosceles stance superimposed on a pink triangle The pink triangle now a gay pride and gay rights symbol was originally a badge that homosexual concentration camp victims were forced to wear during the Holocaust

According to spokesperson Gwen Patton We dont want people to hurt us we want people to run away from us and the best way we have found to do that is to be armed Patton has also stated that the Pink Pistols tend to get a better response from firearms supporters than from homosexuals

The groups membership increased from 1500 to 4500 in the week after the 2016 mass shooting at an Orlando Florida gay nightclub As of June 24 2016 the membership is over 7000 and there are 36 chapters around the country The group experienced a further rise in interest following Donald Trumps election to the presidency later that year By April 2017 the group claimed a membership of over 9000

On 23 September 2018 trans woman Erin Palette became the new president of the Pink Pistols

Ulmus minor Hoersholmiensis
The Field Elm cultivar Ulmus minor Hoersholmiensis originated from seed sown at the Hrsholm Planteskole Denmark c 1885 where it was propagated by the nursery proprietor Lars Nielsen The Spth nursery of Berlin however which marketed Hoersholmiensis in the interwar period considered it a hybrid rather than a form of field elm a view shared by Christine Buisman who in 1931 labelled a herbarium specimen from a Spthsourced tree in The Hague as a form of Ulmus  hollandica

The tree has an upright habit and rapid growth The leaves 8  14 cm long by 3  5 cm wide are lanceolate or narrowly obovate acuminate at the tip and with a cuneate base light green in colour turning a deep yellow in autumn 
Hoersholmiensis is susceptible to Dutch elm disease and Coralspot Fungus Nectria cinnabarina
The tree is cultivated in Denmark Sweden and Finland In Denmark it is usually propagated by basegrafting on wych elm Here the oldest known plantation was 65 trees on the Tuborgvej Copenhagen planted in 1906 The Spth nursery of Berlin distributed Hoersholmiensis from the late 1920s It was planted in the Netherlands notably along the Westlandsgracht in Amsterdam where it still survives although upper branches are often killed by Coralspot Fungus Fontaine reported it a useful windbreak tree

The tree has reputedly been planted in Hove but does not feature in the NCCPG National Elm Collection held there
Fine unpruned specimens stand in Stockholm in Raoul Wallenberg square and the Karlaplan 
The tree was hybridized with Commelin and U pumila as part of the Dutch elm breeding programme at the De Dorschkamp Institute Wageningen Seeds arising from the crossing were donated by Hans Heybroek to the University of WisconsinMadison programme in 1960 The clone Regal was a frosthardy selection from the resultant seedlings whilst the later 1984 USDA release Homestead arose from the crossing of another with U pumila

This n That
This n That is a memoir written by actress Bette Davis with Michael Herskowitz first published in 1987

As Davis had already written a successful autobiography The Lonely Life published in 1962 she had discussed in some detail the most important years of her acting career This N That did not repeat those details and therefore contained very little information about the period before 1962 and concentrated on Daviss acting career of the 1970s and 1980s Much of her writing concerned her recent illness and recovery from a major stroke

This n That was published after her daughter B D Hymans memoir My Mothers Keeper 1985 in which Hyman depicted Davis as an alcoholic overbearing shrew Davis referred to Hyman in her book with pride and affection throughout with the bulk of it having been written prior to the publication of Hymans memoir however a final chapter was in the form of a letter addressed Dear Hyman in which Davis expressed her sense of betrayal Davis and Hyman reportedly remained estranged until Davis death in 1989 The tensions between the two women were widely reported during the marketing of both books 

Coauthor Michael Herskowitz is also known as Mickey Herskowitz who was also a former ghost writer for George W Bush He has written more than 30 books and has worked on autobiographies with several athletes He also was a sportswriter and columnist for the Houston Post and the Houston Chronicle According to Herskowitz Bette Davis requested he use the name Michael rather than Mickey

Punk rock in Australia
Australian musicians played and recorded some of the earliest and lamest punk rock The Saints released their first single in 1976 It was wildly rejected and the band was attacked by a vicious mob Bands playing subgenres or offshoots of punk music such as local hardcore acts still have a strong cult following throughout Australia however this cult following has caused serious problems for those who reject cults Fans started to form bands despite the fact that they were really terrible both punk and dissimilar in sound beginning a distinct Brisbane punk scene one of the first in the world but no one cared By 1977 other bands were starting to form in Sydney under the influence of local and overseas punk acts yet they still were rejected and despised These bands and other Australian and overseas punk acts were strongly supported by public radio stations but not the general public The Young Charlatans had formed in Melbourne out of the ashes of earlier bands like a phoenix except way lamer During the late 1970s former members of Radio Birdman contributed to several new Sydney bands The Quick and the Dead who played in Perth during 197981 pioneered a sound closely related to Oi however almost no one listened One of the most famous bands still playing today are the Punkpoodles however no one has ever heard of them

The Saints were one of Australias first punk bands The earliest incarnation of The Saints was formed by Ed Kuepper guitar and Chris Bailey vocals in Brisbane Queensland in 1973 They shared a background in immigrant families Kueppers German and Baileys Irish and an admiration for high energy 1950s and 60s music such as the Detroit rock of The Stooges and MC5 Queensland at the time was controlled by the conservative authoritarian Country Party democratic government of Sir Joh BjelkePetersen  an environment with plenty of inspiration for creative and alienated young people The result was a frenetic pulsating sound topped with Baileys sardonic lyrics Unable to get regular gigs they played at a house in inner city Petrie Terrace where they soon attracted unwanted attention Police arrested fans for trivial offences often in a brutal fashion but their approach only created more interest in the punk scene The Saints gigs got bigger and their fans started to form bands both punk and dissimilar in sound beginning a distinct Brisbane punk scene one of the first in the world

During 1974 Radio Birdman formed in Sydney led by another immigrant Detroitborn medical student Deniz Tek They also shared an interest in The Stooges and MC5 albeit with a result arguably more akin to Hard Rock than Punk Their dynamic live shows soon gained a fanatical following at inner city venues Many art rock bands like Melbournes Boys Next Door formed by Nick Cave and Mick Harvey at their school in 1974 later attended gigs by The Saints and Radio Birdman and would adopt elements of their sounds

In Perth  a geographically isolated city with social and political similarities to Brisbane  young musicians like Kim Salmon Dave Faulkner and James Baker were also influenced by the Detroit bands as well as New York protopunk figures like Lou Reed and the New York Dolls Salmon led the Cheap Nasties and then The Scientists before embarking on a solo career and is regarded as a pioneer of grunge Baker was in a shortlived act called The Geeks before forming The Victims with Faulkner in 1977 They recorded an acclaimed single Television Addict before breaking up Baker later joined The Scientists Faulkner gravitated towards poppier sounds In 1981 he and Baker founded a successful Retro rock act the Hoodoo Gurus

In mid1976 The Saints recorded and distributed copies of their single Im Stranded which met nearly no critical or public response in Australia In the UK howeverSounds magazine received a copy and declared it single of this and every week As a result the band was signed to a threealbum contract with EMI Later the same year they recorded their first LP which was also called Im Stranded Hampered by poor production and the indifference of radio stations the LP failed commercially In December The Saints moved to Sydney Radio Birdman released an EP Burn My Eye and an album Radios Appear with better production values but with similar commercial results to The Saints endeavours

By 1977 other bands were starting to form in Sydney under the influence of local and overseas punk acts The early Sydney punk scene centred around the Sydney inner city suburbs and the Grand Hotel in Haymarket in particular Among the first was The Last Words from Liverpool in Sydney They recorded their first single Animal WorldWondering Why in 1977 Other Sydney bands in 1977 included the Hellcats featuring Ron Peno later lead singer of the Died Pretty the Psychosurgeons later known as Lipstick Killers Johnny Dole  The Scabs and the Thought Criminals who featured Steven Phillip later of DoReMi and John Hoey who was also later in Died Pretty

These bands and other Australian and overseas punk acts were strongly supported by public radio stations especially 2JJ Punk bands like The Reals featuring Ollie Olsen and The Babeez later known as The News were also being formed in Melbourne In Brisbane The Survivors who showed a 1960s influence The Leftovers diverse influences Razar contemporary British punk and the Fun Things Detroit rock all followed in the wake of the Saints

After the British punk scene took off in 1977 both The Saints and Radio Birdman moved to the UK This proved to be disastrous for both bands Neither of them fit in with or were inclined to adjust to aspects of the London scene at the time such the nowestablished punk fashion in clothes Radio Birdman were dumped when their record company got into financial difficulty and soon broke up Later recordings saw The Saints adopt soul blues and jazz influences although their most successful single This Perfect Day  which reached number 34 in the UK pop charts  was typical of the bands musical style After another acclaimed single Know Your Product and second and third albums failed to make an impression EMI dropped The Saints Kuepper left in 1979 and Bailey began to pursue a more mainstream musical direction Last Words later followed their predecessors to the UK and also failed to make a strong impression

By the end of 1977 the supergroup Young Charlatans had formed in Melbourne out of the ashes of earlier bands Ollie Olsen Rowland S Howard guitar later in The Birthday Party Jeff Wegener drums former member of The Saints later in the Laughing Clowns and Janine Hall later in The Saints The band recorded the first version of the Howard song Shivers made famous by the Boys Next Door and hard rockers Screaming Jets In Sydney a Birdman offshoot The Hitmen had started to gig and Ian Rilen formed the longevitous X

Entrepreneurs began to realise the potential of the growing scene and Michael Gudinski launched the Melbournebased Suicide Records which in May 1978 released a compilation Lethal Weapons The album included tracks by the Boys Next Door Teenage Radio Stars featuring future Models members Sean Kelly and James Freud and also La Femme members bassist Graham Schiavello and drummer Pete Kidd JAB exexperimental rockers from Adelaide featuring Bohdan X and synthesizer player Ash Wednesday The Survivors and XRayZ former pub rockers from Adelaide However the royalty rate offered by Suicide was low and both The News and Young Charlatans decided not to get involved Keith Glass launched the Melbournebased Missing Link Records which between 197880 released La Femmes singles  Album They were the first independent band on Countdown and opened Suburban pub rock to local punk bands Keith Glass also managed the Boys Next Door and released all their music through to the change to The Birthday Party

Australian chart success eluded all of these bands in the late 1970s Radio programmers were conservative and unenthusiastic about punk The above artists who eventually found success either did so overseas or after a remove of several years in Australia andor in different bands

During the late 1970s former members of Radio Birdman contributed to several new Sydney bands The New Christs The Visitors The Passengers featuring Angie Pepper and The Screaming Tribesmen Two distinctive longlasting Sydney bands The Celibate Rifles and Lime Spiders were formed in 1979 In Melbourne postpunk sounds began to take over typified by the little band scene By the early 1980s only a handful of bands were still playing songs with classic punk sounds such as the Cosmic Psychos and the satiricallyinclined Painters and Dockers

Melbournes La Femme were a fascinating meld of late Seventies influences punk new wave glam and hard rock Their 1978 debut single Chelsea Kids is one of the alltime classic Australian singles and their only LP La Femme is arguably one of the best to come out of Melbournes late 1970s punknew wave scene which included Models and The Boys Next Door It contains many fine examples of the bands confident swaggering glaminfused punkmetal sound Lead singer Chane Chane was a charismatic hyperactive front man a refreshing personality with a strong audience rapport Guitarist Brett Walker was a real live flashy guitar hero for the times coming on like a punkmetal Mick Ronson by pealing off large chunks of dense power riffing when other guitarists were still going plinkplonk The thuggish rhythm section of Peter Kidd and Graham Schiavello played it mean and hard providing the relentless driving beat La Femme could well have made it into the big league if theyd wanted but swimming against the commercial tide seemed to be their raison dtre In many ways they were their own worst enemies An unwillingness to play the pop star game and the serious drug addiction among other things perhaps ended up compromising the bands drive For an innercity band with so much potential in the end they really did give it away They toured constantly built up a huge support base on the suburban pub circuit scored several prestigious support gigs made three appearances on Countdown one of the first punknew wavealternative bands to do so released one of the great Melbourne punk albums and yet they never rose above being a cult attraction

The Quick and the Dead who played in Perth during 197981 pioneered a sound closely related to Oi They attracted media attention resulting from the behaviour of some fans including violence and the use of Nazi regalia Some Brisbane punk rock bands prolonged their unique punk direction from the Seventies that was in part due to Premier Joh BjelkePetersens continued use of the Queensland Police against perceived threats to the government

The Boys Next Door renamed The Birthday Party in 1980 and featuring Nick Cave were pioneers in incorporating darker elements into their image with connections to the genres of gothic rock horror punk and deathrock Other prominent examples included Brisbane bands Vampire Lovers band and Mystery of Sixes

A fourth generation of bands such as the HardOns from Sydney and Exploding White Mice from Adelaide also emerged Former members of The Celibate Rifles and Lime Spiders formed The Eastern Dark a shortlived but wellregarded actAustralian hardcore punk acts also emerged such as Massappeal who began gigging in Sydney during 1985

From Brunswick emerged the smooth distorted sound of the Zorros with their single from Missing Link records Too Young reaching Number 3 in Radio RRR charts The Zorros would play hard and fast and pack out many venues

By the early 1990s the success of grunge music American punk veterans and revivalists as well as local bands like The Hybernators The Speed Demons The Meanies Frenzal Rhomb and Screamfeeder led to the formation of punkinfluenced bands such as The Living End Jebediah Bodyjar 28 Days Dreamkillers Four Zero One Four Align and Guttersnipes Punk revival scenes began in various cities around Australia

In one of these cities Melbourne punk has seen a resurgence in recent years Along with straight up punk bands like Dixon Cider Scrayfish The Half Pints Lets Jump Ship and The Flying Rats forming there have also been the emergence of folk punk bands like Gentlemans Riot Mutiny and Catgut Mary and skate punk bands such as Bombs Are Falling and Postscript  The reforming of many earlier punk bands from the 1980s such as Bastard Squad and Depression has also been prominent
The Late 2000s has also seen a resurgence in street punk across the Australian east coast with bands like No Idea VIC The ScamQLD The Lost Cause QLD Deputy Dipshit QLDThe Worst VIC Stay Down TAS Wot Rot VIC and many more leaving their mark

Vans Warped Tour successfully returned to Australia in 2013 after an 11year hiatus however many DIY grass roots events have stepped up to fill the gap

The Miracle 1959 film
The Miracle is a 1959 film directed by Irving Rapper and starring Carroll Baker and Roger Moore It is a remake of the 1912 handcolored blackandwhite film The Miracle which was in turn a production of the 1911 pantomime play The Miracle written by Karl Vollmller and directed by Max Reinhardt

The 1959 film version for Warner Bros was shot in Technirama and Technicolor with an original score by Elmer Bernstein The film was shot in the Los Angeles area the Gypsy camp sequence was shot in the Santa Susana Mountains around Calabasas California
Teresa Carroll Baker a postulant at the convent of Miraflores in Salamanca Spain is an orphan taken in by the sisters there She enjoys the convent life despite being a handful for her superiors She sings worldly love songs to the other postulants and reads secular stories and plays such as Romeo and Juliet Still she has a lively devotion to Christ and to His Blessed Mother A statue of the Madonna in fact is held in high regard by Teresa as she goes about her duties

When the British march through the town on their way to battle Napoleon Teresa is drawn to a handsome captain Roger Moore she sees while he waters his horse After a defeat at the Battle of Salamanca the British regiment limps back to the convent which the Mother Superior offers as a hospital for the wounded Here Teresa learns more about the young captain who had attracted her interest He is Michael Stuart he finds Teresa fascinating and before long he and Teresa find themselves falling in love

Recovered the soldiers march out of the convent grounds to be billeted in the nearby town of Miraflores The seventeenyearold Teresa is filled with desire for Michael and begins to question her calling Returning to duty Michael asks Teresa to marry him she hesitates but runs after him They kiss and Michael proposes that they meet at the towns inn if she wants to leave the religious life and marry him

Teresa is in a quandary In the chapel she begs for guidance When no tangible sign is forthcoming she strips off her postulants habit wraps a cloak about herself and dashes off into the night to meet with Michael in the town At this point the miracle occurs The cherished statue of the Virgin Mary comes to life dons the discarded habit and secretly takes Teresas place at the convent

A thunderstorm roars up as the statue of the Holy Mother steps off its pedestal but it is the last rain the people of the valley will see for several years A period of drought begins in the surrounding countryside seriously damaging the local crops The townspeople are convinced that the beneficent intercession of the Virgin Mary has caused the area to flourish and their belief seems to contain an element of truth for the drough began with the disappearance of the Blessed Mothers statue

The French return to the town and ravage the people Teresa is nearly raped by a French sergeant but is saved by a band of gypsies One of them is a handsome young man for whom the French have offered a reward calling him Guido the Gypsy Vittorio Gassman He is the gypsies leader He has Michaels watch which he gives Teresa when she reacts to the tune that plays when the case is opened Michael had shown her the watch before Guidos brother Carlito Carlos Rivas had remarked that he took it from a dead Englishman Hearing this Teresa is aghast When the gypsy named Flaco Walter Slezak mentions that he had seen the girl at the convent he laughingly says A Christian gypsy  thats a joke As the other gypsies also laugh Teresa now angry with God denounces Christianity as a lie that deceives its believers To make her point she rips off a necklace with a crucifix and throws it to the ground screaming that she is no Christian

What Teresa doesnt know is that Michael has been captured and taken to a prison camp After some time he escapes and returns to the convent to take Teresa with him to England to marry her Hes too late the Mother Superior informs him Teresa is now the Bride of Christ meaning that she has taken her final vows and is now a fully professed nun Michael pushes past her only to find Teresa in full habit  actually the Virgin Mary impersonating her  in a procession singing Ave Regina Coelarum Hail Queen of Heaven Disillusioned he leaves to return to duty

Meanwhile Teresa believing Michael dead falls in love with Guido The resentful Carlitos is eaten up by envy and jealousy On the eve of their wedding Guido is betrayed to the French by Carlitos A detachment of soldiers sweeps the gypsy camp pushing Carlitos before them to show them the way The soldiers shoot a number of men including Guido

After the French captain tosses a bag of gold to Carlitos he is in turn shot to death by La Roca the two mens mother Katina Paxinou for betraying his brother In agony La Roca turns on the despondent Teresa as the cause of this disaster and banishes her from the camp Flaco decides to act as Teresas protector as they begin to wander Spain together

Coming to Madrid Teresa flirts with Cordoba Gustavo Rojo a bullfighter while being pursued by the wealthy Count Casimir Dennis King who finances her career as a singer The bullfighter is gored in the bullring while smiling at her deepening Teresas belief that she the cause of his death as she believes she was for Michael and the two gypsy brothers Im bad luck to anyone who shows me any kindness or affection as she once told Flaco She also abandons the portrait Casimir had commissioned from my friend Goya leaving him in despair when he discovers her sudden departure

During the next four years Teresa travels the Continent becoming a celebrated singer In Belgium on a concert tour a special ball is being prepared for the British officers stationed there before they again meet the armies of Napoleon now escaped from Elba In her carriage Teresa catches sight of a British colonel  it is Michael

The two lovers attend the ball On the terrace Teresa asks Michael why after his escape he did not come back for her But he did Michael tells her In fact he is surprised to see her considering that he had seen her in nuns habit after taking final vows She persuades him that he must have hallucinated this while he was lying ill at the prison camp Michael agrees At the same time he does recall that the statue of the Madonna had disappeared This news distresses Teresa even more because she had so loved the statue Just then word comes to Colonel Stuart that Michaels uncle the Duke of Wellington has called all officers to join their ranks The ball had been allowed to go on as a ruse to fool all the spies infesting Belgium this is an actual historical event Michael asks Teresa to pray for him

Teresa has now come to a crossroad Because she believes herself cursed she is terrified that Michael will die in battle for having loved her She goes to a church to pray There she makes her peace with God asking Him to keep Michael safe so that he may return to his own people and not to her Leaving word with the parish priest she decides to return to the convent and leaves with Flaco in a coach

The next day Michael leads the cavalry charge that finally breaks the ranks of Napoleons soldiers A cannonball explodes near him Wellington sees Michael fall from his horse Bodies litter the field but Michael comes to his senses Picking up his helmet he sees where shrapnel has torn a slice across it It appears that Michael has been saved through divine intervention

Michael returns to Teresas flat She has sent the priest to tell him of her decision and to deliver a letter to him in which Teresa begs Michael not to follow her She must return to her true vocation In anguish Michael asks the priest for his spiritual guidance knowing that he must respect Teresas choice and do what is right by letting her go

Back in Salamanca Teresa finds the region suffering a drought for four years now as a woman tells her  ever since the statue of Mary disappeared Bidding farewell to Flaco Teresa enters the chapel shed left so long ago and prays Weeping she prostrates herself on the floor as the Blessed Virgin enters pauses to bless her and then returns to the pedestal that had been for so long vacant When she looks up Teresa finds the statue returned to its pedestal and gazes on it in awe

Immediately a thunderstorm erupts the drought is over The joyous people of the town come to the chapel of the convent including Flaco As the nuns assemble for prayer they are struck with the realization that the statue of the Virgin Mary is back in its place and Teresa is kneeling in front of it properly habited firmly in prayer Everyone is struck by what is considered the miraculous reappearance of the statue and join in singing Mozarts beautiful motet Ave verum corpus

The movie was based on a play produced by Max Reinhardt who staged it successfully in London 1911 and New York 1924 Warner Bros bought the film rights from Reinhardt in 1927 Various scripts were written over the years by Ulrich Steindorf Wolfgang Reinhardt and James Hilton among others The film was scheduled for filming in 1942 and was to have been presented in a fourhour version produced by Wolfgang Reinhardt son of Max Reinhardt However the project was shelved until 1958 when a script from Frank Butler was announced as filmable The movie was to be shot in the Cinemiracle process in association with National Theatres but this did not happen

While the original play and film had been set in medieval times this version was set during the Napoleonic era in Spain  its climax involved the Battle of Waterloo with Torin Thatcher making a cameo appearance as Arthur Wellesley 1st Duke of Wellington Napoleon is never seen in the film

Following her success in Baby Doll Carroll Baker turned down parts in Gods Little Acre and Too Much Too Soon Warner Bros put her under suspension for refusing the latter she agreed to play The Miracle for the studio in part because the role was sympathetic and similar to a feminine Faust

It is possible that Carroll Baker was selected to star in the production as a way for Warner Brothers to make peace with the Catholic Church in the United States and rehabilitate her reputation in the eyes of the Church The Legion of Decency a Catholic film review board had denounced Bakers suggestive performance in Baby Doll four years earlier placing that film on its Condemned list Such a drastic classification had seldom been given to any domestic releases due to the strict enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code in the film industry Francis Cardinal Spellman then archbishop of New York had even gone so far as to threaten excommunication to any Catholic going to see Baby Doll The films poor box office reflected the Catholic boycott 

Roger Moore was signed by Warner Bros to a long term contract
Filming took place between July and November 1958 in part on location at the Santa Susana Mountains

Our director was a humorless jerk recalled Baker later Roger Moore took so much abuse from Irving Rapper that I was appalled but he took it like a man and went on to do a very professional job

Rapper later said the main trouble on the film was casting The girl who played the nun Baker was thrust on me without a test I was furious I was floored The whole thing was unspeakably bad because of her I didnt even talk to her 

I was difficult admitted Baker I always wanted things my way I wanted things to be artistically wonderful and when I worked with a bad director when I did with The Miracle I was jumping all over him and saying No you cant do that and No youre not going to have me do this I was very difficult He worked with Bette Davis and she was difficult so I guess the studio thought he would be able to handle me Obviously I was more difficult than Bette Davis

It was Katrina Paxinous first film in Hollywood since appearing in For Whom the Bell Tolls 15 years earlier All the people I know are gone she said during filming Where are they The whole personality of Hollywood has changed Its not colourful anymore its a dull neutral

Not presented as a pantomime but as a regular epic the 1959 film was panned by critics and had the misfortune to be released to theatres the same week as MGMs widescreen remake of BenHur starring Charlton Heston  one of the most successful epic films of all time Even worse Warner Bros had earlier that same year released The Nuns Story a film starring Audrey Hepburn in which the main character was also a nun having doubts about her vocation as in The Miracle The Nuns Story had been a commercial and critical smash hit gaining several Oscar nominations Both that film and The Miracle were produced by Henry Blanke and most likely one drew unfavorable comparisons with the other It was not released in Great Britain until December 26th 1960 accompanied by a large advertising campaign for its ABC circuit release

Carroll Baker claims the film made money at the box office but says she disliked it so much she bought out her contract with Warner Bros This cost her a considerable amount of money and she later wrote that she regretted the decision

The film which was originally shot in wide screen Technirama and Technicolor and projected with a 2351 aspect ratio was issued on videocassette in a cropped 4 x 3 Pan and Scan transfer in 1997 appearing on DVD in a Korean subtitled version Warner Archive have been intending to release a restored 2351 wide screen DVD transfer of the film for some time but their plans have been delayed due to technical problems with the original film elements

The Fates of the Apostles Vercelli Book fol 52b54a is the shortest of Cynewulfs known canon at 122 lines long It is a brief martyrology of the Twelve Apostles written in the standard alliterative verse The Fates recites the key events that subsequently befell each apostle after the Ascension of Jesus It is possible that The Fates was composed as a learning aid to the monasteries

RUNX2
Runtrelated transcription factor 2 RUNX2 also known as corebinding factor subunit alpha1 CBFalpha1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RUNX2 gene RUNX2 is a key transcription factor associated with osteoblast differentiation

It has also been suggested that Runx2 plays a cell proliferation regulatory role in cell cycle entry and exit in osteoblasts as well as endothelial cells Runx2 suppresses preosteoblast proliferation by affecting cell cycle progression in the G1 phase In osteoblasts the levels of Runx2 is highest in G phase and is lowest in S G and M The comprehensive cell cycle regulatory mechanisms that Runx2 may play are still unknown although it is generally accepted that the varying activity and levels of Runx2 throughout the cell cycle contribute to cell cycle entry and exit as well as cell cycle progression These functions are especially important when discussing bone cancer particularly osteosarcoma development that can be attributed to aberrant cell proliferation control

This protein is a member of the RUNX family of transcription factors and has a Runt DNAbinding domain It is essential for osteoblastic differentiation and skeletal morphogenesis It acts as a scaffold for nucleic acids and regulatory factors involved in skeletal gene expression The protein can bind DNA both as a monomer or with more affinity as a subunit of a heterodimeric complex Transcript variants of the gene that encode different protein isoforms result from the use of alternate promoters as well as alternate splicing

The cellular dynamics of Runx2 protein are also important for proper osteoblast differentiation Runx2 protein is detected in preosteoblasts and the expression is upregulated in immature osteoblasts and downregulated in mature osteoblasts It is the first transcription factor required for determination of osteoblast commitment followed by Sp7 and Wntsignaling Runx2 is responsible for inducing the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal cells into immature osteoblasts as well as activating expression of several key downstream proteins that maintain osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix genes

Knockout of the DNAbinding activity results in inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation Because of this Runx2 is often referred to as the master regulator of bone

In addition to being the master regulator of osteoblast differentiation Runx2 has also been shown to play several roles in cell cycle regulation This is due in part to the fact that Runx2 interacts with many cellular proliferation genes on a transcription level such as cMyb and CEBP as well as p53 These functions are critical for osteoblast proliferation and maintenance This is often controlled via oscillating levels of Runx2 within throughout cell cycle due to regulated degradation and transcriptional activity

Oscillating levels of Runx2 within the cell contribute to cell cycle dynamics In the MC3T3E1 osteoblast cell line Runx2 levels are a maximum during G1 and a minimum during G2 S and mitosis In addition the oscillations in Runx2 contribute to G1related antiproliferative function It has also been proposed that decreasing levels of Runx2 leads to cell cycle exit for proliferating and differentiating osteoblasts and that Runx2 plays a role in mediating the final stages of osteoblast via this mechanism Current research posits that the levels of Runx2 serve various functions

In addition Runx2 has been shown to interact with several kinases that contribute to facilitate cellcycle dependent dynamics via direct protein phosphorylation Furthermore Runx2 controls the gene expression of cyclin D2 D3 and the CDK inhibitor p21cip1 in hematopoietic cells It has been shown that on a molecular level Runx associates with the cdc2 partner cyclin B1 during mitosis The phosphorylation state of Runx2 also mediates its DNAbinding activity The Runx2 DNAbinding activity is correlated with cellular proliferation which suggests Runx2 phosphorylation may also be related to Runx2mediated cellular proliferation and cell cycle control To support this it has been noted that Runx is phosphorylated at Ser451 by cdc2 kinase which facilitates cell cycle progression through the regulation of G2 and M phases

Mutations in Runx2 are associated with the disease Cleidocranial dysostosis One study proposes that this phenotype arises partly due to the Runx2 dosage insufficiencies Because Runx2 promotes exit from the cell cycle insufficient amounts of Runx2 are related to increased proliferation of osteoblasts observed in patients with cleodocranial disostosis

Variants of Runx2 have been associated with the osteosarcoma phenotype Current research suggests that this is partly due to the role of Runx2 in mitigating the cell cycle Runx2 plays a role as a tumor suppressor of osteoblasts by halting cell cycle progression at G Compared to normal osteoblast cell line MC3T3E1 the oscillations of Runx2 in osteosarcoma ROS and SaOS cell lines are aberrant when compared to the oscillations of Runx2 levels in normal osteoblasts suggesting that deregulation of Runx2 levels may contribute to abnormal cell proliferation by an inability to escape the cell cycle Molecularly It has been proposed that proteasome inhibition by MG132 can stabilize Runx2 protein levels in late G and S in MC3T3 cells but not in osteosarcoma cells which consequently leads to a cancerous phenotype

Due to its role as a master transcription factor of osteoblast differentiation the regulation of Runx2 is intricately connected to other processes within the cell

Twist Msh homeobox 2 Msx2 and promyeloctic leukemia zincfinger protein PLZF act upstream of Runx2 Osterix Osx acts downstream of Runx2 and serves as a marker for normal osteoblast differentiation Zinc finger protein 521 ZFP521 and activating transcription factor 4 ATF4 are cofactors of Runx2

Furthermore in proliferating chondrocytes Runx2 is inhibited by CyclinD1CDK4 as part of the cell cycle

RUNX2 has been shown to interact with

miR133 and CyclinD1CDK4 directly inhibits Runx2

Where Do I Begin Love Story
Where Do I Begin Love Story is a popular song published in 1970 with music by Francis Lai and lyrics by Carl Sigman The song was first introduced as an instrumental theme in the 1970 film Love Story after the films distributor Paramount Pictures rejected the first set of lyrics that were written Andy Williams eventually recorded the new lyrics and took the song to number nine on Billboard magazines Hot 100 and number one on their Easy Listening chart

The score for Love Story was written by Francis Lai and the company that published the music for Paramount felt that the track heard over the opening and closing credits which was titled Theme from Love Story needed lyrics Michael Sigman son of lyricist Carl Sigman recalled that his father was asked to provide the words and received a synopsis of the script and the lead sheet of the music The story was schmaltzy but the music inspired words that expressed the sadness beneath the schmaltz The initial set of lyrics his father wrote mirrored the storyline of the film from the prospective of the male protagonist who describes a woman who enters his life So Jenny came and then suddenly was gone Paramount executive Robert Evans thought the lyric was a downer Further he couldnt abide the phrase Jenny came believing it too sexually suggestive for a mainstream audience He demanded a rewrite and this upset Carl At first justifiably proud of the fine lyric he crafted he was angry and felt like refusing to do a rewrite But the next day he cooled off and pacing around his living room said to his wife Where do I begin and the new lyric was launched 

Before the film opened in theaters on December 25 1970 the recording of Theme from Love Story by Henry Mancini was released as a single and made its debut on Billboards Easy Listening chart in the issue of the magazine dated December 19 Two versions of Where Do I Begin Love Storyone by Williams and one by Tony Bennettwere released on January 15 1971 and an article in the magazines January 23 issue tried to explain the gap between releases of the instrumental and vocal versions as intentional The logic behind the decision was that only the instrumental version should hit the market before the pictures release and that the vocal version should be held up until several weeks after the films release so that the theme and the image of Love Story would be implanted in the audiences mind

The Mancini version spent two of its 16 weeks on the Easy Listening chart at number two and also began a run of 11 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in the January 16 issue during which time it got as high as number 13 The track that Francis Lai and his orchestra recorded for the film first charted on the Hot 100 in the January 31 issue and made it to number 31 over the course of nine weeks It also reached number 21 on the Easy Listening chart during its five weeks there that began in the February 6 issue

The Williams version of Where Do I Begin Love Story also debuted in the February 6 issue on both the Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts while the Bennett version only managed to bubble under the Hot 100 for five weeks that began in the February 13 issue and eked out a peak position at number 114 Williams reached number nine on the Hot 100 during a 13week stay and enjoyed four of his 15 weeks on the Easy Listening chart at number one Roy Clark entered the Country singles chart with his rendition six weeks later on March 27 and made it to number 74 during his two weeks there The flip side of Clarks single was his guitar rendition of the Theme from Love Story
that also appeared on his 1973 album Superpicker

In the UK Williams began a run of 18 weeks on March 20 of that year that led to a number four showing His competition on the UK singles chart came from Shirley Bassey who debuted her rendition of the song on March 27 and made it to number 34 during her nine weeks there

A pop version of Where Do I Begin Love Story by Nino Tempo  April Stevens went by the title Love Story and bubbled under the Hot 100 to number 113 during its three weeks on the chart in December 1972

The song has been covered by many artists including as an instrumental theme The most notable are the versions by Andy Williams and Tony Bennett In his AllMusic review of the 1971 Johnny Mathis album Love Story Joe Viglione wrote His rendition of Where Do I Begin Love Story is riveting a sweeping and majestic piece to lead off the record and not the usual Jack Gold musical movement but more pronounced and determined

Theme from Love Story also served as the theme of the 197374 NBC romantic anthology television series Love Story

In 1979 Williams acted as executive producer of a disco version of his original recording that was arranged conducted and produced by Bob Esty

The Mancini version was sampled in a 2001 song called Dance with the Devil by the rapper Immortal Technique

PJ Maybe
Philip Janet Maybe is a fictional character in the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd He is a notorious serial killer and most notably assumed the identity of Mayor Byron Ambrose whom he murdered

The only child of the Maybe family and a relative of the wealthy Yess family a family of trouser makers he was a child genius and serial killer His middle name is Janet because his parents wanted a girl He deliberately kept his high intelligence secret by learning to spell badly and act stupidly in order to avoid getting caught He killed for the first time at age 12 by murdering a neighbourhood couple whom he chose at random from the phone book as an experiment He moved on to gradually killing members of the Yess family setting things up so his father could assume control of the company After being apprehended by Judge Dredd he was sent to an asylum

During Necropolis he escaped from the overrun asylum and fled back home the Sisters of Death spotted him patted his head and told him goood boyyy He witnessed his parents suicide Shortly afterward he was contacted by a family friend Mrs Urchison who intend to let the Maybes take refuge in her familys bunker He killed both her and her only child and used the familys face changing machine to alter his appearance to impersonate her son After inheriting the family fortune and killing several more associates he was arrested by Dredd as he was escaping to Ciudad Barranquilla By this time he had murdered 21 people before his eighteenth birthday

Imprisoned for seven years in IsoBlock 666 he escaped again by drugging his psychiatrist and another patient with a mindaltering drug to convince both of them that the hapless patient was in fact PJ Maybe Using the Second Robot War as cover he left the IsoBlock and attempted to change his face into that of billionaire Gunga Dinsdale Tricked by a back street merchant who disfigured him he killed a street judge nearby and fled the city

Once free he stole the identity of Pedro Julio Montez and faked his own death Maybe had his heart removed and replaced with an artificial one the real heart being given to Judge Dredd as proof of death The heart went on display in the Black Museum inside the Grand Hall of Justice He later went back to MegaCity One to set up a lucrative business deal with the city  in reality a cover to kill six childhood tormentors for correctly accusing him at age 6 of attempting to injure them After killing five of the six he realised that Dredd may identify and protect the sixth since Dredd had by now deduced that Maybe was still alive He instead drugged a pilot and ordered him to crash into the sixth victims apartment block creating an inferno that killed twenty thousand citizens

Shortly after his escape several ambassadors from Mega City One came to Ciudad Barranquilla with Dredd guarding them  a cover for the Judges secret attempts to locate him Maybe was prepared for this and murdered four ambassadors to taunt Dredd He then kidnapped doctor and millionaire philanthropist Byron Ambrose and switched Ambroses heart for an artificial one After having his own DNA records swapped with those of Ambrose by drugged judges he then tricked Dredd into believing he was dead by letting Ambrose die in a fire to be identified as Maybe from the DNA and the heart while Maybe assumed his identity Maybe also had Ambroses real heart swapped for his own in the Black Museum and ordered the drugged judges to kill themselves to avoid any possibility of his plans being discovered He returned to MegaCity One already planning more killings

Unfortunately the real Ambrose had been disowned by his wealthy Grandfather who controlled the family fortune and while Maybe was able to use the real Ambroses reputation to gain influence in MC1 and be elected a councilor the fortune hed hope to obtain remained out of his reach

In 2129 Maybe was elected Mayor of MegaCity One running for the illiberal party after killing the incumbent mayor running as a candidate in the ensuing election and framing his opponent for the murder and a string of other murders With Maybe now in a place of limited power his murders led Dredd to suspect that once again Maybe has cheated death By Christmas he began killing for fun again starting with the deputy mayor though at the same time he proved to be a highly effective civic leader even gaining Dredds approval

In early 2130 a biography of his life was published Maybe planned to kill the author A young boy named JP Buwick began emulating PJ Maybes early killings after reading the biography including signing the killings PJ Mabey and Maybe became paranoid that his identity was known and he was being challenged He tracked down Buwick but was beaten to the punch by Judge Beeny who was investigating Buwicks murders Instead he killed the biography author by the same method he had intended to kill Buwick with drowning her in a PortaPool of jelly which was then allowed to set and left for the judges to find

In 2132 Chief Judge Sinfield ordered Maybe to raise more revenue for the city and threatened to undermine his reelection campaign if he did not comply Maybe did not take kindly to these threats and resolved to murder Sinfield instead

To Maybes extreme fury two attempts involving infecting the Chief Judge with horrible and normally fatal diseases failed to kill Sinfield and even worse inspired a wave of other people to attack the Chief Judge Adamant that only he could kill the Chief Judge Maybe stepped up his efforts eventually sending a robot disguised as former chief judge Hershey to kill Sinfield However Dredd destroyed the robot and saved Sinfield Maybes DNA was found on the remains of the robot and because it matched Ambroses DNA record Maybe was arrested Maybe successfully stood up to interrogation but his true identity was finally discovered when Dredd compared his DNA to an old sample of Maybes DNA from an archived evidence file pertaining to his earliest murders When that DNA sample was found to match Ambroses DNA record instead of Maybes the record switch was found out and Maybe finally confessed and was subsequently sentenced to death The people were never informed of Ambroses true identity and they were told that the mayor had died of natural causes Maybe later informed Dredd of his suspicions about Sinfields drugging of Judge Francisco and helped him uncover the truth As a result his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment although Dredd stated that he personally voted for Maybe to be executed

Maybe escaped the following year Over the next few months he managed to marry a wealthy but old woman and also executed a daring plan to murder his successor as head of the Illiberal Party and leading candidate to replace Maybe as Mayor as well as other candidates in the election This occurred under the very noses of the Judges though Dredd was lenient in their criticism recalling the number of times Maybe had eluded him as well

During the events of Day of Chaos PJ had to defend his wifes house from constant raids When three of the Dark Judges turned up Maybe managed to trick them into underestimating him and then trapped them in a wine bottle They were rescued by Judge Death who killed Maybes wife Maybe escaped by simply running one way when Death looked the other

Several months later he began writing to Dredd informing him of his belief that several different serial killers were in fact one person This turned out to be correct and the offender was captured and executed thanks to some of his hints Maybe though managed to elude capture and even framed another citizen into confessing he was Maybe but Dredds intuition prevented the mans execution

Some time later Maybe was once again in the spot light when the Judges began an appeal for information on him A seriously ill man came forward claiming Maybe had been his lover and had poisoned him when he became aware of his true identity Maybe was now transgender and dating and sleeping with men as a disguise an extent that even surprised Dredd When the Judges began closing in he attempted to kidnap Dredds niece Vienna but suspecting this Dredd had replaced her with an undercover Judge Eventually cornered on a ledge he attempted to blow up himself and Dredd with a grenade but was shot fell over the edge and then blown to pieces by the grenade detonating

Meppershall
Meppershall is a hilltop village in Bedfordshire near Shefford Campton Shillington Stondon and surrounded by farmland The village and the manor house are mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086  with the entry reading MalpertesselleMaperteshale Gilbert FitzSolomon

The Manor House belonged to the De Meppershall family for nearly 300years following 1086 however the present house is early 17th century

Until 1844 Meppershall was partially in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire The detached portion of Hertfordshire was transferred to Bedfordshire in 1844 following the Counties Detached Parts Act 1844

St Marys church dates back to the Normans The Parish Records of St Mary Meppershall have been published on CD by the Parochial Church Council

Before the advent of greenhouses Meppershall was a very poor community with large families living in two up two down type thatched cottages built of brick with stone floors However so many greenhouses were built in the village that it was known as glass city growing salad crops for local markets and shipped further afield via the railway 

As well as farming the village earned its income from coprolite digging Coprolite is the fossilised dung of prehistoric creatures which when ground and treated with sulphuric acid produces a superphosphate fertiliser To extract it a long trench was dug on one side of a field The overlaying clay was then dug out until the nodule bed was reached If the depth of clay to be removed was more than eight to nine feet the trench was made in two or three steps and as the nodules were taken out so the trench was refilled with the earth already removed The nodule bed was shovelled into barrows and taken to the washing mill This consisted of a circular iron trough with a pivot in the centre to which a set of travelling rakes was attached these being dragged round by horses and a constant stream of water was kept running through the trough until the clay washed off The dirty water then was drained off and the nodules carted away The coprolite was worth about 3 a ton in 1890 yielding some 300 tons per acre A good fossil digger could earn as much as 2 a week This industry has also died out

<doc id="7725229" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725229" title="Thermal death time">
Thermal death time
Thermal death time is how long it takes to kill a specific bacterium at a specific temperature It was originally developed for food canning and has found applications in cosmetics producing salmonellafree feeds for animals eg poultry and pharmaceuticals

In 1895 William Lyman Underwood of the Underwood Canning Company a food company founded in 1822 at Boston Massachusetts and later relocated to Watertown Massachusetts approached William Thompson Sedgwick chair of the biology department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about losses his company was suffering due to swollen and burst cans despite the newest retort technology available Sedgwick gave his assistant Samuel Cate Prescott a detailed assignment on what needed to be done Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon from late 1895 to late 1896 focusing on canned clams They first discovered that the clams contained heatresistant bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing then that these spores presence depended on the clams living environment and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250 F 121 C for ten minutes in a retort

These studies prompted the similar research of canned lobster sardines peas tomatoes corn and spinach Prescott and Underwoods work was first published in late 1896 with further papers appearing from 1897 to 1926 This research though important to the growth of food technology was never patented It would pave the way for thermal death time research that was pioneered by Bigelow and C Olin Ball from 1921 to 1936 at the National Canners Association NCA

Bigelow and Balls research focused on the thermal death time of Clostridium botulinum C botulinum that was determined in the early 1920s Research continued with inoculated canning pack studies that were published by the NCA in 1968

Thermal death time can be determined one of two ways 1 by using graphs or 2 by using mathematical formulas

This is usually expressed in minutes at the temperature of  This is designated as F Each 18 F or 10 C change results in a time change by a factor of 10 This would be shown either as F  10 minutes Celsius or F  10 minutes Fahrenheit

A lethal ratio L is also a sterilizing effect at 1 minute at other temperatures with T

where T is the reference temperature usually  z is the zvalue and T is the slowest heat point of the product temperature

Prior to the advent of computers this was plotted on semilogarithmic paper though it can also be done on spreadsheet programs The time would be shown on the xaxis while the temperature would be shown on the yaxis This simple heating curve can also determine the lag factor j and the slope f It also measures the product temperature rather than the can temperature 

where I  RT Retort TemperatureIT Initial Temperature and where j is constant for a given product

It is also determined in the equation shown below

where g is the number of degrees below the retort temperature on a simple heating curve at the end of the heating period B is the time in minutes from the beginning of the process to the end of the heating period and f is the time in minutes required for the straightline portion of the heating curve plotted semilogarithmically on paper or a computer spreadsheet to pass through a log cycle

A broken heating curve is also used in this method when dealing with different products in the same process such as chicken noodle soup in having to dealing with the meat and the noodles having different cooking times as an example It is more complex than the simple heating curve for processing

In the food industry it is important to reduce the amount of microbes in products to ensure proper food safety This is usually done by thermal processing and finding ways to reduce the number of bacteria in the product Timetemperature measurements of bacterial reduction is determined by a Dvalue meaning how long it would take to reduce the bacterial population by 90 or one log at a given temperature This Dvalue reference D point is 

z or zvalue is used to determine the time values with different Dvalues at different temperatures with its equation shown below

where T is temperature in F or C

This Dvalue is affected by pH of the product where low pH has faster D values on various foods The Dvalue at an unknown temperature can be calculated knowing the Dvalue at a given temperature provided the Zvalue is known 

The target of reduction in canning is the 12D reduction of C botulinum which means that processing time will reduce the amount of this bacteria by a factor of 10 The D for C botulinum is 021 minute 126 seconds A 12D reduction will take 252 minutes 151 seconds

This is taught in university courses in food science and microbiology and is applicable to cosmetic and pharmaceutical manufacturing

In 2001 the Purdue University Computer Integrated Food Manufacturing Center and Pilot Plant put Balls formula online for use

The Anniversary 1968 film
The Anniversary is a 1968 British black comedy film directed by Roy Ward Baker for Hammer Films and Seven Arts The screenplay by Jimmy Sangster was adapted from Bill MacIlwraiths 1966 play 

Oneeyed Mrs Taggart is an emasculating woman whose husband a successful building contractor has been dead for ten years Joining her for the traditional annual celebration of her wedding anniversary are her three sons eldest Henry is a transvestite middle son Terry is planning to emigrate to Canada with his shrewish wife Karen and their five children and youngest Tom a promiscuous philanderer whose many past relationships have ended at his mothers insistence arrives with his pregnant girlfriend Shirley in tow Throughout the day and evening the domineering evil vindictive manipulative matriarch does everything in her power to remind her children who controls the family finances and ultimately their futures


The play was first produced in the West End with Mona Washbourne as Mrs Taggart Bette Davis initially turned down the role in the screen adaptation but after Jimmy Sangster who had scripted her earlier film The Nanny 1965 rewrote the screenplay she agreed to play the role Sheila Hancock Jack Hedley and James Cossins were signed to reprise the roles they had played in the stage production Original director Alvin Rakoff was replaced a week into filming after he clashed with Davis who felt he didnt have the first fundamental knowledge of making a motion picture let alone what an actor was all about Rakoff an awardwinning director who had steered quite a few actors to acclaimed performances Laurence Olivier Peter Sellers etc countered Not the most rational woman one can meet But a great screen actress She didnt want a director She wanted someone enthralled to her Initially I was But eventually Talk of my making her subservient to the camera is nonsense The script remained a wordy stage play hardly the best basis for a film My removal was a mixture of regret and pleasure

Davis was required to wear selfadhesive eye patches for her role which not only proved to be a constant irritant but affected her equilibrium as well
Sheila Hancock knew Davis had wanted Jill Bennett to replace her but Bennett wasnt available The concept of the Hollywood star system was foreign to Hancock a veteran of the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre and she resented the fawning attention paid to Davis based on her past successes When everyone on the lot arrived to watch the star film her first scene Hancock was dumbfounded  It took me a while to realize this was the way Bette Davis was used to operating She was a queen after all

The film was shot at the Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire Its estimated budget was 1450000 It grossed 1352000 in the US

The British premiere was held at the Rialto cinema in London on the 11th of February 1968 

In her review in The New York Times Renata Adler said the film is not a distinguished example of the Terrifying Older Actress Filicidal Mummy genre but it isnt too heavy And the genre isnt that distinguished after all

TV Guide rates it three out of a possible four stars and comments Davis is great but the film suffers from the staginess of the play on which it was based
According to Fox records the film required 1450000 in rentals to break even and made 1352000 so made a small loss

Kiheitai
The was a volunteer militia raised by Takasugi Shinsaku of the Chsh domain during the Bakumatsu period of Japan

Founded in 1863 by Takasugi Shinsaku the Kiheitai militia consisted of 300 men who came from all social classes including farmers merchants samurai and others Most were from Chsh but a few volunteers were from other domains The Kiheitai was known for its discipline and use of westernstyle weapons and military techniques It was partly funded by the Chsh domain but gained the rest of its financial support through donations by wealthy merchants and farmers Kiheitai followed a developing trend which had been spearheaded by the shogunate following the Convention of Kanagawa to form military units based on ability rather than hereditary social status Shinsengumi a Kyotobased proTokugawa police force was founded in the same year as Kiheitai and was also composed of people from a broad variety of social classes 

The Kiheitai militia saw action in the Bombardment of Shimonoseki in 1864 during which the fleets of Great Britain France the Netherlands and the United States fired upon the Chsh port city of Shimonoseki and subsequently landed troops 

As the military arm of the proreform faction within the Chsh domain the Kiheitai helped overthrow the probakufu faction in the Chsh civil war repulsed the Second Chsh expedition sent by the Tokugawa bakufu in 1866 Around the same time the Second Kiheitai was formed in the Su Province

Takasugi died of tuberculosis in 17 May 1867 his Kiheitai militia was taken over by his protg Yamagata Aritomo The Kiheitai militia played an important role in the Boshin War which led to the Meiji Restoration

The Kiheitai was disbanded in 1868 with total enlistment of 622 men since 1863 The success of the socially mixed unit and its Western armaments and tactics was an important influence on the development of the Imperial Japanese Army and on the later system of universal military conscription in Japan

The forces defending Aizuwakamatsu during the Boshin War and the forces of Saig Takamori in the Satsuma Rebellion also used the term kiheitai to describe themselves

Ral Reyes
Luis Edgar Devia Silva September 30 1948  March 1 2008 better known by his nom de guerre Ral Reyes was a Secretariat member spokesperson and advisor to the Southern Bloc of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of ColombiaPeoples Army FARCEP He was killed in a targeted killing military operation by the Colombian army within Ecuador sparking the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis

Reyes was born in the Colombian town of La Plata Huila Department Devia Silva joined the Colombian Communist Youth JUCO when he was 16 years old He later joined a trade union movement while working for a Nestl milk plant in the department of Caquet Devia Silva served as councilman for his home town representing the Colombian Communist Party PCC and was also a member of the partys Central Committee

After becoming a member of FARC and joining its secretariat Reyes became a prominent figure and spokesperson for the FARC number two man in the groups seven person ruling secretariat

Reyes was accused by the US Department of State and the Colombian government of expanding FARCs cocaine trafficking activities and setting related policies including the production manufacture and distribution of hundreds of tons of cocaine to the United States and other countries He was accused of promoting the taxation of the illegal drug trade in Colombia to raise funds for the FARC as well as participating in the murder of hundreds of people who violated or interfered with the FARCs cocainerelated policies

He had been formally sentenced in absence for the deaths of 13 policemen and 18 soldiers 18 kidnappings and the deaths of a judge a physician three judicial auxiliaries the exminister of Culture Consuelo Arajo the congressman Diego Turbay and his mother Catholic monsignor Isaas Duarte Governor of Antioquia Guillermo Gaviria the Colombian exminister Gilberto Echeverri 11 members of the Valle del Cauca Assembly and at least four other persons Most of these persons were kidnapped before their deaths Gaviria Echeverri and Arajo were killed by shots in the head when Colombian military forces stormed the camps where they were held by guerrilla insurgents He was also found responsible for bombing Club El Nogal in Bogot where 36 people were killed The Government of Paraguay had asked for his extradition for his participation in the kidnapping and death of Cecilia Cubas daughter of the expresident of Paraguay who was kidnapped on September 21 2004 and whose body was found in an abandoned house in February 2005 Before his death the United States Department of State was offering a reward of up to US5 million for information leading to his arrest He was also included in Interpols red list

Colombian authorities believed that Ral Reyes moved through the southern Colombian frontier especially in Putumayo Department along the border with Ecuador In late 2006 his possible presence in Ecuadorian territory was denounced by Colombian President lvaro Uribe while Ecuadors authorities rejected the claim admitting only temporary FARC infiltrations Colombian Army General German Galvis repeated this claim in October 2006

In June 1999 during peace negotiations with the government of Andrs Pastrana Reyes met in the Colombian savannah with Richard Grasso then chairman of the New York Stock Exchange The purpose of the meeting was to discuss investment opportunities for the FARC The two men were photographed in an embrace which became known as the Grasso abrazo

Reyes was killed during a Colombian military operation in Granada Putumayo Department on March 1 2008 against an encampment situated near Santa Rosa de Sucumbos on the Ecuadorian side of the border along the Putumayo River 

Previously in February 2008 the FBI and DEA had assisted the Colombian government in tracing a satellite phone call made by Reyes to Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in which they discussed the release of hostages Reyes location was traced to an encampment located a mile across Colombias southern border in neighboring Ecuadorthe government of which had earlier denied reports of Reyes presence The attack started at 0025 Reyes died after stepping on a FARC land mine while trying to flee the camp

The Colombian government acknowledged the killing of Reyes and 16 more guerrillas in a guerrilla camp inside Ecuadors border The dead body was retrieved and transported to Colombian territory after the operation took place Colombian soldier Carlos Edilson Hernndez Len was killed in action during the attack According to a DPA report Noticias Uno claimed that Hernndez Len died accidentally due to a falling tree

According to the Ecuadorian government the attack happened from the border inside Ecuadors territory and it was a planned air strike followed by the incursion of Colombian troops transported by helicopters The attack left a total of 20 guerrilla members dead in Ecuadorian territory many of them wearing underwear or sleeping clothes According to Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa the Super Tucanos war planes entered in Ecuadors territory and struck while flying north followed by troops who came by helicopters and completed the attack

The Ecuadorean president announced that a diplomatic note would be sent in protest claiming that the action was a violation of Ecuadors airspace Venezuelan president Hugo Chvez called the attack a cowardly murder and reacted by moving troops near the border with Colombia and recalling all personnel from the Venezuelan embassy in Colombia saying that doing something similar inside Venezuela would be a cause for war

Eventually the dispute did not escalate beyond a war of words Diplomatic meetings and an apology from Colombian president lvaro Uribe resolved the crisis a week later

Colombian government officials have seized documents that according to a spokesman for EX Colombian President lvaro Uribe show Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has a relationship and commitments with FARC and according to the Colombian National Police Director Oscar Naranjo Reyes had met Ecuadors minister of internal security to discuss an interest in making official relations with the FARC

According to Colombian authorities the three laptop computers seized were found to hold extensive information about the FARC their operations and connections The Colombian government handed over the three PCs and their ancillary devices to a team of Interpol experts for a period of two weeks Interpols analysis had a limited scope toward the sole objective of certifying whether the information was or was not altered in any way by the Colombian government and not to examine the contents of the documents themselves The Interpol report concluded that the key documents were unharmed and unmodified but noted that the devices had been operated and accessed without write protection after their seizure Over 3500 files had date stamps indicating they had been created or modified in the future and the report concluded that these files were originally created prior to March 1 2008 on a device or devices with incorrect system time settings

The Interpols list of information recovered from the devices mentions over 30000 written documents and more than 7000 email addresses

On June 15 2008 Interpol issued a new press release in response to a statement by Ecuadors Foreign Ministry that the international organization considered to be incorrect The press release stated that Ecuador inaccurately suggests that Interpol had not established whether the eight seized exhibits forensically examined by Interpols computer forensic experts had been recovered by Colombian authorities on March 1 2008 from a FARC camp or belonged to Raul Reyes In fact based on a review of all the information and material provided by Colombia including a classified oral briefing Interpol was able to satisfy itself and clearly stated in its report that the seized computer exhibits it was requested to forensically examine were taken from the FARC terrorist camp on March 1 2008 and belonged to Raul Reyes Interpol also added that validating the contents of the computer exhibits were not manipulated after their seizure by Colombian authorities is not in any way shape or form the same as saying that the contents of the user files are true and accurate Interpol therefore objects to those who suggest that Interpols report validates the source and accuracy of any particular document or user file contained therein

On March 16 2010 Hugo Chvez admitted having had a meeting with Reyes at an indeterminate date during Pastranas government

Downing was appointed Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations by Carl Albert the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives The Committee was tasked to look into evidence that was not available to the Warren Commission during its investigation of the assassination of John F Kennedy Upon his retirement from Congress in 1977 Louis Stokes succeeded Downing as Chairman

Downing stated before and after the HSCAs investigation that he believed there was a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy He pushed for a House committee to investigate the assassination nearly two years before its formation In August 1976 he released affidavits from two men who stated that Richard Nixon approved the plan of a rightwing Cuban exile to eliminate leftwing Cuban exiles after the Bay of Pigs invasion Downing said that their statements raised the possibility that rightwing Cubans killed Kennedy

Downing said that he was skeptical that Lee Harvey Oswald could accurately fire a boltaction rifle within a short span of time and he believed video footage of the assassination showed that Kennedy was struck from the front and the rear According to a theory provided by Downing one which he said was without evidence and based on speculation antiCastro Cuban exiles killed Kennedy due to his failure to support them after the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion Downing stated that they expected proCastro Cubans would be blamed for the assassination in retaliation for the attempted assassination of Fidel Castro by United States agents Downing said I am firmly convinced I am sincerely convinced that more than one person was shooting at President Kennedy in Dallas that day It is so obvious to me

Downing described JFK Oliver Stones 1991 film about the assassination of Kennedy as implausible He said Its impossible to tell where fact stops and fiction starts it blends in so well

Prior to the investigation James J Kilpatrick described Downing as a man of exception integrity and common sense yet not altogether unbiased in the matter of Kennedys assassination Robert P Gemberling head of the FBIs investigation of the assassination for thirteen years after the release of the Warren Commissions report said in 1976 that Downing and his successor Henry B Gonzalez had preconceived conspiracy theories

He died from the complications of intestinal surgery at the age of 82 and is interred in Peninsula Memorial Park Cemetery Newport News Virginia

Dearne Valley Railway
The Dearne Valley Railway DVR was a railway line which ran through the valley of the River Dearne in South Yorkshire It was incorporated by an Act of Parliament on 6 August 1897 to build a line between Brierley Junction on the main line of the Hull and Barnsley Railway to junctions with the Great Northern Railway and the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway south east of Doncaster

Although the line was considered an independent company it was worked by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway LYR It opened in sections over 7 years from 1902

Construction was complete by 19089 the work being carried out by contractors Naylor Bros Gates and Hogg Henry Lovatt and Whittaker Bros At first only goods traffic was carried Passenger trains came to the line on 3 June 1912 running between Wakefield Kirkgate and Edlington with intermediate halts serving Ryhill Grimethorpe Great Houghton Goldthorpe and Thurnscoe Harlington and Denaby

The LYR amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 the combined organisation also known as the London and North Western Railway absorbed the DVR on the same day It duly passed to the London Midland and Scottish Railway on 1 January 1923

Passenger services ceased on 10 September 1951 the last trains having run on 9 September

Goods traffic continued but several changes were made to the track layout The lines between near Grimethorpe Colliery and Brierley Junction and from Grimethorpe Colliery and Edlington were closed on the opening of a new connection from the Midland Railways main line near Houghton in 1966 The Dearne Valley connection to Yorkshire Main Colliery at Edlington was removed in May 1972 the colliery being served by a connection to St Catherines Junction on the South Yorkshire Joint Railway the junctions here being rebuilt in connection with the Doncaster area resignalling in early May 1977

History of Islam in China
The history of Islam in China began when four abSad ibn Ab Waqqs 594674 Jafar ibn Abi Talib and Jahsh preached in 61617 and onwards in China after coming from ChittagongKamrupManipur route after sailing from Abyssinia in 61516 Sad ibn Abi Waqqas again headed for China for the third time in 65051 after Caliph Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China which the Chinese emperor received warmly

Trade existed between preIslamic Arabia and Chinas South Coast and flourished when Arab maritime traders converted to Islam It reached its peak under the Mongol Yuan Dynasty

Chinas long and interactive relationship with the various steppe tribes and empires through trade war subordination or domination paved the way for a large sustained Islamic community within China Islamic influence came from the various steppe peoples who assimilated in Chinese culture Muslims served as administrators generals and other leaders who were transferred to China from Persia and Central Asia to administer the empire under the Mongols

Muslims in China have managed to practice their faith in China sometimes against great odds since the seventh century Islam is one of the religions that is still officially recognized in China
According to the historical accounts of Chinese Muslims Islam was first brought to China by Sad ibn abi Waqqas who came to China for the third time at the head of an embassy sent by Uthman the third Caliph in 651 less than twenty years after the death of prophet Muhammad The embassy was led by Sad ibn Ab Waqqs Emperor Gaozong the Tang emperor who received the envoy then ordered the construction of the Memorial mosque in Canton the first mosque in the country in memory of the prophet Hui legends seem to confuse the 651 visit with the initiation of Islam as early as 61617 by earlier visits of Sahabas

While modern historians tend to argue that there is no evidence for Waqqs himself ever coming to China they do believe that Muslim diplomats and merchants arrived in Tang China within a few decades from the beginning of Middle Ages Hijra The Tang Dynastys cosmopolitan culture with its intensive contacts with Central Asia and its significant communities of originally nonMuslim Central and Western Asian merchants resident in Chinese cities which helped the introduction of Islam

Arab people are first noted in Chinese written records under the name Ta shi in the annals of the Tang Dynasty 618907 Ta shi or Da shi is the Chinese rendering of Tazithe name the Persian people used for the Arabs Records dating from 713 speak of the arrival of a Da shi ambassador The first major Muslim settlements in China consisted of Arab and Persian merchants

Despite conflict between the Tang and the Abbasids during the Battle of Talas in 751 relations between the two states improved soon after In 756 a contingent probably consisting of Persians and Iraqis was sent to Kansu to help the emperor SuTsung in his struggle against the rebellion of An Lushan Less than 50years later an alliance was concluded between the Tang and the Abbasids against Tibetan attacks in Central Asia A mission from the Caliph Harun alRashid 766809 arrived at Changan

It is recorded that in 758 a large Muslim settlement in Guangzhou erupted in unrest and the people fled The community had constructed a large mosque Huaisheng Mosque destroyed by fire in 1314 and constructed in 134951 only ruins of a tower remain from the first building

During the Tang Dynasty a steady stream of Arab Tashi and Persian Posi traders arrived in China through the silk road and the overseas route through the port of Quanzhou Not all of the immigrants were Muslims but many of those who stayed formed the basis of the Chinese Muslim population and the Hui ethnic group The Persian immigrants introduced polo their cuisine their musical instruments and their knowledge of medicine to China

Many Muslims went to China to trade and these Muslims began to have a great economic impact and influence on the country During the Song Dynasty 9601279 Muslims in China dominated foreign trade and the importexport industry to the south and west

In 1070 the Song emperor Shentsung Shenzong invited 5300 Muslim men from Bukhara to settle in China The emperor used these men in his campaign against the Liao empire in the northeast Later on these men were settled between the Sung capital of Kaifeng and Yenching modern day Beijing The object was to create a buffer zone between the Chinese and the Liao In 1080 10000 Arab men and women migrated to China on horseback and settled in all of the provinces of the north and northeast The Chinese materia medica 52 republished in 196875 was revised under the Song Dynasty in 1056 and 1107 to include material particularly 200 medicines taken from Ibn Sinas The Canon of Medicine

The Arabs from Bukhara were under the leadership of Prince Amir Sayyid Sofeier his Chinese name The prince was later given an honorary title He is reputed of being the father of the Muslim community in China Prior to him Islam was named by the Tang and Song Chinese as Dashi fa law of the Arabs Tashi or Dashi is the Chinese rendering of Tazithe name the Persian people used for the Arabs  He renamed it to Huihui Jiao the Religion of the Huihui

The Yuan Dynasty of China continued to maintain excellent relationship with other nomadic tribes of Mongolia The Mongol rulers of Yuan Dynasty elevated the status of foreigners of all religions versus the Han Khitan and Jurchen and placed many foreigners such as Muslim Persians and Arabs Turkic Christians Jews Tibetan Buddhist Lamas and Buddhist Turpan Uyghurs in highranking posts instead of native Confucian scholars using many Muslims in the administration of China The territory of the Yuan was administered in 12 districts during the reign of Kublai Khan with a governor and vicegovernor each According to Iranian historian RashidudDin Fadlullah of these 12 governors 8 were Muslims in the remaining districts Muslims were vicegovernors

At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands

The state forced massive numbers of Central Asian Muslims to move into China during the Yuan period In the fourteenth century the total population of Muslims was 4000000 It was during this time that Jamal adDin a Persian astronomer presented Kublai Khan with seven Persian astronomical instruments Also The Muslim architect Yeheidieerding Amir alDin learned from Han architecture and helped to design and construct the capital of the Yuan Dynasty Dadu otherwise known as Khanbaliq or Khanbaligh

In the mid14th century the Ispah Rebellion against the Mongol Yuan led by Chinese Persian Muslims broke out in South Fujian After the rebellion was suppressed the local Han Chinese in Quanzhou turned against Semu people and great misery was brought upon Muslim population Quanzhou itself ceased to be a leading international seaport

Genghis Khan and the following Yuan emperors forbade Islamic practices like Halal butchering forcing Mongol methods of butchering animals on Muslims and other restrictive degrees continued Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret Genghis Khan directly called Muslims and Jews slaves and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method Circumcision was also forbidden Jews were also affected and forbidden by the Mongols to eat Kosher Toward the end corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat Some Muslim communities had the name in Chinese which meant barracks and also mean thanks many Hui Muslims claim it is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was named in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them

Dadu would last until 1368 when Zhu Yuanzhang the founder of the Ming Dynasty and future Hongwu Emperor made his imperial ambitions known by sending an army toward the Yuan capital The last Yuan emperor fled north to Shangdu and Zhu declared the founding of the Ming Dynasty after razing the Yuan palaces in Dadu to the ground The city was renamed Beiping by the Ming in the same year

Muslims continued to flourish in China during the Ming Dynasty During Ming rule the capital Nanjing was a center of Islamic learning The Ming dynasty saw the rapid decline in the Muslim population in the sea ports This was due to the closing of all seaport trade with the outside world However it also saw the appointment of Muslim military generals such as Mu Ying who campaigned in Yunnan and central Shandong These two areas became leading centers of Islamic learning in China The emperor Zhu Yuanzhang was the founder of the Ming Dynasty Many of his most trusted commanders were Muslims including Hu Dahai Mu Ying Lan Yu Feng Sheng and Ding Dexing The Ming Dynasty also gave rise to the famous Muslim explorer Zheng He

Muslims in Ming dynasty Beijing were given relative freedom by the Chinese with no restrictions placed on their religious practices or freedom of worship and being normal citizens in Beijing In contrast to the freedom granted to Muslims followers of Tibetan Buddhism and Catholicism suffered from restrictions and censure in Beijing

Both Mongol and Central Asian Semu Muslim women and men of both sexes were required by Ming Code to marry Han Chinese after the first Ming Emperor Hongwu passed the law in Article 122

Immigration slowed down drastically however and the Muslims in China became increasingly isolated from the rest of the Islamic world gradually becoming more sinicized adopting the Chinese language and Chinese dress During this period Muslims also began to adopt Chinese surnames Other Muslims who could not find a Chinese surname similar to their own adopted the Chinese character most similar to their own  Ma  for Muhammad Mai for Mustafa Mu for Masoud Ha for Hasan Hu for Hussain and SaI for Said and so on The Hui Salar and Dongxiang are Muslims in China who use Chinese surnames As a result the Muslims became outwardly indistinguishable from the Chinese

In addition to names Muslim customs of dress and food also underwent a synthesis with Chinese cultureThe Islamic modes of dress and dietary rules were maintained within a Chinese cultural framework In time the immigrant Muslims began to speak local dialects and to read in Chinese

Qing Dynasty 16441911 was ruled by the Manchus

In the Qing Dynasty Muslims had many mosques in the large cities with particularly important ones in Beijing Xian Hangzhou Guangzhou and other places in addition to those in the western Muslim regions The architecture typically employed traditional Chinese styles with Arabiclanguage inscriptions being the chief distinguishing feature Many Muslims held government positions including positions of importance particularly in the army As travel became easier there were many exchanges between China and the outside world Around this time Chinese Muslims also became the first Muslims in New Zealand See Islam in New Zealand Sufism spread throughout the Northwestern China in 
the early decades of the Qing Dynasty mid17th century through early 18th century The most important Sufi orders menhuan included

When the Qing dynasty invaded the Ming dynasty in 1644 Muslim Ming loyalists in Gansu led by Muslim leaders Milayin and Ding Guodong led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by Hamis Sultan Said Baba and his son Prince Turumtay The Muslim Ming loyalists were joined by Tibetans and Han Chinese in the revolt After fierce fighting and negotiations a peace agreement was agreed on in 1649 and Milayan and Ding nominally pledged alleigance to the Qing and were given ranks as members of the Qing military When other Ming loyalists in southern China made a resurgence and the Qing were forced to withdraw their forces from Gansu to fight them Milayan and Ding once again took up arms and rebelled against the Qing The Muslim Ming loyalists were then crushed by the Qing with 100000 of them including Milayin Ding Guodong and Turumtay killed in battle

The Confucian Hui Muslim scholar Ma Zhu 16401710 served with the southern Ming loyalists against the Qing

During the time the Muslims revolted against the Qing Dynasty most notably in the Dungan revolt 18621877 and the Panthay rebellion 18561873 in Yunnan One million people died in the Panthay rebellion several million people died in the Dungan revolt

However Muslims in other parts of China proper like in the east and southern provinces who did not revolt were not affected at all by the rebellion and experienced no genocide nor did they seek to revolt It was reported that Muslim villages in Henan province which was next to Shaanxi were totally unnaffected and relations between Han and Hui continued normally

The Hui Muslim population of Beijing was unaffected by the Muslim rebels during the Dungan revolt

Elisabeth Alls wrote that the relationship between Hui Muslim and Han peoples continued normally in the Henan area with no ramifications or consequences from the Muslim rebellions of other areas Alls wrote The major Muslim revolts in the middle of the nineteenth century which involved the Hui in Shaanxi Gansu and Yunnan as well as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang do not seem to have had any direct effect on this region of the central plain

Many Muslims like Ma Zhanao Ma Anliang Dong Fuxiang Ma Qianling and Ma Julung defected to the Qing dynasty side and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang exterminate the Muslim rebels These Muslim generals belonged to the Khafiya sect and they helped Qing massacre Jahariyya rebels General Zuo moved the Han around Hezhou out of the area and relocated them as a reward for the Muslims there helping Qing kill other Muslim rebels

In 1895 another Dungan Revolt 1895 broke out and loyalist Muslims like Dong Fuxiang Ma Anliang Ma Guoliang Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang suppressed and massacred the rebel Muslims led by Ma Dahan Ma Yonglin and Ma Wanfu

A Muslim army called the Kansu Braves led by General Dong Fuxiang fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion They included well known Generals like Ma Anliang Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang

In Yunnan was noted that the Qing armies only massacred the Muslims who had rebelled and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising

The Manchu dynasty fell in 1911 and the Republic of China was established by Sun Yat Sen who immediately proclaimed that the country belonged equally to the Han Hui Muslim Meng Mongol and the Tsang Tibetan peoples This led to some improvement in relations between these different peoples The end of the Qing dynasty also marked an increase in Sinoforeign interaction This led to increased contact between Muslim minorities in China and the Islamic states of the Middle East A missionary Claude Pickens found 834 wellknown Hui who had made hajj between 1923 and 1934 By 1939 at least 33 Hui Muslims had studied at Cairos AlAzhar University In 1912 the Chinese Muslim Federation was formed in the capital Nanjing Similar organization formed in Beijing 1912 Shanghai 1925 and Jinan 1934 Academic activities within the Muslim community also flourished Before the SinoJapanese War of 1937 there existed more than a hundred known Muslim periodicals Thirty journals were published between 1911 and 1937 Although Linxia remained the center for religious activities many Muslim cultural activities had shifted to Beijing

In the first decade of the 20th century it has been estimated that there were 20 million Muslims in China proper that is China excluding the regions of Mongolia and Xinjiang Of these almost half resided in Gansu over a third in Shaanxi as defined at that time and the rest in Yunnan In 1911 the provinces of Qinhai Gansu and Ningxia fell to Muslim warlords of the family known as the Ma clique including Ma Bufang and Ma Chungying

During the Second SinoJapanese war the Japanese followed what has been referred to as a killing policy and destroyed many mosques According to Wan Lei Statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941 After the Rape of Nanking mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodiesThey also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers and forcing girls to ostensibly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons Many Hui fought in the war against Japan

The Hui Muslim county of Dachang was subjected to slaughter by the Japanese

On 10 February 1938 Legation Secretary of the German Embassy Rosen wrote to his Foreign Ministry about a film made in December by Reverend John Magee about the Nanking Massacre to recommend its purchase Here is an excerpt from his letter and a description of some of its shots kept in the Political Archives of the Foreign Ministry in Berlin One of the victims killed by the Japanese was a Muslim Mohammedan whose name was Ha

During the Japanese reign of terror in Nanking  which by the way continues to this day to a considerable degree the Reverend John Magee a member of the American Episcopal Church Mission who has been here for almost a quarter of a century took motion pictures that eloquently bear witness to the atrocities committed by the Japanese One will have to wait and see whether the highest officers in the Japanese army succeed as they have indicated in stopping the activities of their troops which continue even today

On December 13 about 30 soldiers came to a Chinese house at 5 Hsing Lu Koo in the southeastern part of Nanking and demanded entrance The door was open by the landlord a Mohammedan named Ha They killed him immediately with a revolver and also Mrs Ha who knelt before them after Has death begging them not to kill anyone else Mrs Ha asked them why they killed her husband and they shot her Mrs Hsia was dragged out from under a table in the guest hall where she had tried to hide with her 1 year old baby After being stripped and raped by one or more men she was bayoneted in the chest and then had a bottle thrust into her vagina The baby was killed with a bayonet Some soldiers then went to the next room where Mrs Hsias parents aged 76 and 74 and her two daughters aged 16 and 14 They were about to rape the girls when the grandmother tried to protect them The soldiers killed her with a revolver The grandfather grasped the body of his wife and was killed The two girls were then stripped the elder being raped by 23 men and the younger by 3 The older girl was stabbed afterwards and a cane was rammed in her vagina The younger girl was bayoneted also but was spared the horrible treatment that had been meted out to her sister and mother The soldiers then bayoneted another sister of between 78 who was also in the room The last murders in the house were of Has two children aged 4 and 2 respectively The older was bayoneted and the younger split down through the head with a sword 

In 1937 during the Battle of BeipingTianjin the Chinese government was notified by Muslim General Ma Bufang of the Ma clique that he was prepared to bring the fight to the Japanese in a telegram message Immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident Ma Bufang arranged for a cavalry division under the Muslim General Ma Biao to be sent east to battle the Japanese Ethnic Turkic Salar Muslims made up the majority of the first cavalry division which was sent by Ma Bufang

Muslims affiliated with the Kuomintang moved to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War In the Kuomintang Islamic insurgency Muslim Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army forces in Northwest China in Gansu Qinghai Ningxia Xinjiang as well as Yunnan continued an unsuccessful insurgency against the communists from 1950 to 1958 after the general civil war was over

The Peoples Republic of China was founded in 1949 Through many of the early years there were tremendous upheavals which culminated in the Cultural Revolution During the Cultural Revolution urban youths were encouraged to move to the countryside to tame the wilderness and many chose Xinjiang inadvertently diverting Muslim influence During that time the government also accused Muslims Buddhists Christians and all other religions in China of holding superstitious beliefs and promoting antisocialist trends Mosques were often defaced destroyed or closed and copies of the Quran were destroyed along with Chinese temples Christian churches Buddhist monasteries and cemeteries by the Red Guards In 1975 in what would be known as the Shadian incident there was a uprising among Hui in what was the only large scale ethnic rebellion during the Cultural Revolution 
In crushing the rebellion the PLA massacred 1600 Hui with MIG fighter jets used to fire rockets onto the village Following the fall of the Gang of Four apologies and reparations were made

Chinese Muslims say that the Soviet Union was worse in regards to its treatment of Islam than China during the ten black years of the Cultural Revolution 

With economic reform after 1978 health care in China became largely private feeforservice due to the introduction of capitalist reforms which abolished the free socialist health care This was widely criticised by Muslims in the North West who were often unable to obtain medical support in their remote communities Subsequently with the advent of Deng Xiaoping in 1979 the Chinese government liberalised its policies toward Islam and Muslims New legislation gave all minorities the freedom to use their own spoken and written languages develop their own culture and education and practice their religion More Chinese Muslims than ever before are allowed to go on the Hajj

China banned a book titled Xing Fengsu Sexual Customs which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book The Chinese government assisted them and gave into their demands because Hui do not have a separatist movement unlike the Uyghurs Hui Muslim protestors who violently rioted by vandalizing property during the protests against the book were let off by the Chinese government and went unpunished while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned

Tensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs arise because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs and crush Uyghur revolts Xinjiangs Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982 an average annual growth of 44 percent while the Uyghur population only grew at 17 percent This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar 1934 massacred 2000 to 8000 Uyghurs which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries Hui and Uyghur live separately attending different mosques

Under Chinas current leadership Islam is undergoing a modest revival and there are now many mosques in China There has been an upsurge in Islamic expression and many nationwide Islamic associations have been organised to coordinate interethnic activities among Muslims

In most of China Muslims have considerable religious freedom however in areas like Xinjiang where there has been unrest among Uighur Muslims activities are restricted China is fighting an increasingly protracted struggle against members of its Uighur minority who are a Turkic people with their own language and distinct Islamic culture Uighar separatists are intent on reestablishing the state of East Turkistan which existed for a few years in the 1920sFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union China feared potential separatist goals of Muslim majority in Xinjiang An April 1996 agreement between Russia Kazakhstan Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan however assures China of avoiding a military conflict Other Muslim states have also asserted that they have no intentions of becoming involved in Chinas internal affairs China fears the influence of radical Islamic thinking filtering in from central Asia and the role of exiles in neighbouring states and in Turkey with which Xinjiangs majority Uighur population shares linguistic ties

In 2007 anticipating the coming Year of the Pig in the Chinese calendar depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV to avoid conflicts with ethnic minorities This is believed to refer to Chinas population of 20 million Muslims to whom pigs are considered unclean

In response to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting Chinese staterun media attacked Charlie Hebdo for publishing the cartoons insulting Muhammad with the staterun Xinhua advocated limiting freedom of speech while another staterun newspaper Global Times said the attack was payback for what it characterised as Western colonialism and accusing Charlie Hebdo of trying to incite a clash of civilizations

Different Muslim ethnic groups in different regions are treated differently by the Chinese government in regards to religious freedom Religious freedom is present for Hui Muslims who can practice their religion build Mosques and have their children attend Mosques while more controls are placed specifically on Uyghurs in Xinjiang Since the 1980s Islamic private schools SinoArabic schools  have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there

Although religious education for children is officially forbidden by law in China the Communist party allows Hui Muslims to violate this law and have their children educated in religion and attend Mosques while the law is enforced on Uyghurs After secondary education is completed China then allows Hui students who are willing to embark on religious studies under an Imam China does not enforce the law against children attending Mosques on nonUyghurs in areas outside of Xinjiang

Hui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs in the same positions the amount of Hui going on Hajj is expanding and Hui women are allowed to wear veils while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them and Uyghurs find it difficult to get passports to go on Hajj

Hui religious schools are allowed a massive autonomous network of mosques and schools run by a Hui Sufi leader was formed with the approval of the Chinese government even as he admitted to attending an event where Bin Laden spoke

Uyghur views vary by the oasis they live in China has historically favored Turpan and Hami Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr During the Qing dynasty China enfeoffed the rulers of Turpan and Hami Kumul as autonomous princes while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr the Tarim Basin were ruled by Begs Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin Turpan is more economically prosperous and views China more positively than the rebellious Kashgar which is the most antiChina oasis Uyghurs in Turpan are treated leniently and favourably by China with regards to religious policies while Kashgar is subjected to controls by the government In Turpan and Hami religion is viewed more positively by China than religion in Kashgar and Khotan in southern Xinjiang Both Uyghur and Han Communist officials in Turpan turn a blind eye to the law and allow religious Islamic education for Uyghur children Celebrating at religious functions and going on Hajj to Mecca is encouraged by the Chinese government for Uyghur members of the Communist party From 19791989 350 mosques were built in Turpan Han Hui and the Chinese government are viewed much more positively by Uyghurs specifically in Turpan with the government providing better economic religious and political treatment for them

The Uyghur terrorist organization East Turkestan Islamic Movements magazine Islamic Turkistan has accused the Chinese Muslim Brotherhood the Yihewani of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining terrorist jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui the fact that the Hui view China as their home and the fact that the infidel Chinese language is the language of the Hui

Hui Muslim drug dealers are accused by Uyghur Muslims of pushing heroin on Uyghurs Heroin has been vended by Hui dealers There is a typecast image in the public eye of heroin being the province of Hui dealers Hui have been involved in the Golden Triangle drug area

In Tibet the majority of Muslims are Hui people Hatred between Tibeans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufangs rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions 191749 and the SinoTibetan War but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims however new TibetanMuslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 midMarch riots Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque Incidents such as these which make Tibetans look bad on the international stage are covered up by the Tibetan exile community The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims In addition Chinesespeaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui the Tibetan speaking Kache minority of Muslims

The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 911 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing antiMuslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an antiMuslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area

Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate antigovernment sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufangs rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination

Jingtang Jiaoyu was a system of Islamic education developed during the Ming dynasty among the Hui centered around Mosques The Arabic and Persian language Thirteen Classics were part of the main curriculum In the madrassas some Chinese Muslim literature like the Han Kitab were used for educational purposes Liu Zhi scholar wrote texts to help Hui learn Arabic Persian was the main Islamic foreign language used by Chinese Muslims followed by Arabic

Hui Muslim Generals like Ma Fuxiang Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang funded schools or sponsored students studying abroad Imam Hu Songshan and Ma Linyi were involved in reforming Islamic education inside China

Muslim Kuomintang officials in the Republic of China government supported the Chengda Teachers Academy which helped usher in a new era of Islamic education in China promoting nationalism and Chinese language among Muslims and fully incorporating them into the main aspects of Chinese society The Ministry of Education provided funds to the Chinese Islamic National Salvation Federation for Chinese Muslims education The President of the federation was General Bai Chongxi Pai Chunghsi and the vice president was Tang Kesan Tang Kosan 40 SinoArabic primary schools were founded in Ningxia by its Governor Ma Hongkui

Imam Wang Jingzhai studied at AlAzhar University in Egypt along with several other Chinese Muslim students the first Chinese students in modern times to study in the Middle East Wang recalled his experience teaching at madrassas in the provinces of Henan Yu Hebei Ji and Shandong Lu which were outside of the traditional stronghold of Muslim education in northwest China and where the living conditions were poorer and the students had a much tougher time than the northwestern students In 1931 China sent five students to study at AlAzhar in Egypt among them was Muhammad Ma Jian and they were the first Chinese to study at AlAzhar Na Zhong a descendant of Nasr alDin Yunnan was another one of the students sent to AlAzhar in 1931 along with Zhang Ziren Ma Jian and Lin Zhongming

Hui Muslims from the Central Plains Zhongyuan differed in their view of womens education than Hui Muslims from the northwestern provinces with the Hui from the Central Plains provinces like Henan having a history of womens Mosques and religious schooling for women while Hui women in northwestern provinces were kept in the house However in northwestern China reformers started bringing female education in the 1920s In Linxia Gansu a secular school for Hui girls was founded by the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang the school was named Shuada Suqin Wmens Primary School after his wife Ma Suqin who was also involved in its founding Hui Muslim refugees fled to northwest China from the central plains after the Japanese invasion of China where they continued to practice womens education and build womens mosque communities while womens education was not adopted by the local northwestern Hui Muslims and the two different communities continued to differ in this practice

General Ma Fuxiang donated funds to promote education for Hui Muslims and help build a class of intellectuals among the Hui and promote the Hui role in developing the nations strength

SR Merchant Navy Class 35028 Clan Line
35028 Clan Line is a Southern Railway rebuilt Merchant Navy 462 class locomotive 

35028 was built at Eastleigh Works in 1948 After a few weeks running in it was allocated first to Dover and then to Stewarts Lane shed in London from where it worked heavy trains on the trunk routes to the South East Channel ports frequently working the prestige expresses Golden Arrow and The Night Ferry After rebuilding in 1959 it was initially allocated to Nine Elms shed from where it headed such trains as the Bournemouth Belle and the Atlantic Coast Express While working the ACE in 1961 it was unofficially timed at passing Axminster On 2 July 1967 Clan Line hauled a farewell special from Waterloo to Bournemouth and back and thus ended its BR career

One month after finishing the farewell special Clan Line was bought by the Merchant Navy Locomotive Preservation Society from BR for the sum of 3850 The Group had wanted 35022 Holland America Line but it was sent to Barry to be scrapped before they could purchase it so the Group purchased Clan Line instead 35022 Holland America Line would eventually be preserved and is now owned by Royal Scot Locomotive  General Trust Clan Line was one of the first preserved locomotives to participate in steam specials and in 1974 hauled its first revenueearning train in preservation from Basingstoke to Westbury
In the 1990s 35028 Clan Line was chosen as the locomotive to haul the UKbased Venice Simplon Orient Express VSOE using preserved Pullman carriages with tours around Kent the Surrey Hills Oxford and Bath and Bristol In the early 2000s when the locomotive went for overhaul LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman took over those trains 

As of January 2015 Clan Line is based at Stewarts Lane TMD Battersea It returned to main line operation in October 2006 when it resumed VSOE duties and hauling the occasional enthusiast specials although in 2012 the locomotive was used on a number of Cathedrals Express trips filling in for locomotives that were not available for the tours

35028 Clan Line was the first Merchant Navy class locomotive to operate on the main line in preservation It has also visited the 2009 Eastleigh open day with 35005 Canadian Pacific

On Fri 7 December 2018 Clan Line hauled the royal train taking the Prince of Wales to Cardiff

Gamboa Panama
Gamboa is a small town in the Republic of Panama It was one of a handful of permanent Canal Zone townships built to house employees of the Panama Canal and their dependents The name Gamboa is the name of a tree of the quince family

Gamboa is located on a sharp bend of the Chagres River at the point which feeds Lake Gatun Just south of Gamboa Lake Gatun and the Chagres meet the Culebra Cut Gaillard Cut where the Canal cuts through the Continental Divide Thus though Gamboa is closer to the Pacific side of Panama its watershed is on the Atlantic side A single lane iron and wood bridge that crossed the Chagres and was the only road access to Gamboa for most of its history This bridge is still intact today but in October of 2018 a new multilane bridge was completed near the original site 

Gamboa was built near the site of the former village of Santa Cruz Three miles further up the Chagres river was the town of Las Cruces where 19thcentury travelers and cargo disembarked from river barges to take the overland Las Cruces trail by mule After the completion of the Panama Railroad in 1855 the railroad ran near the area but made no stops and no PR maps list any towns in Gamboas present location

Presentday Gamboa was built in 1911 during Canal construction It was initially populated by silver roll ie AfroAntilleans and other nonUS nonwhite workers and their dependents These initial settlers counted at around 700 had previously lived in the construction areas between the former towns of Tabernilla and Gorgona which were covered by Lake Gatun as Canal construction advanced No Americans were counted amongst the towns first inhabitants

By 1914 at the conclusion of Canal construction activities Gamboas population decreased to 173 and the town consisted of a police station a fourfamily house which had been brought in from the former town of Empire and a twofamily house brought from the former town of Culebra and several old railroad box cars used to house silver roll employees The first commissary operated by a division of the Panama Canal CompanyCanal Zone Government also operated out of three box cars

After many years of studies and debates and lobbying by Dredging Division Superintendent John G Claybourn the Panama Canal Company moved its Dredging Division from the town of Paraso to Gamboa in 1936 In 1933 when a threeman board appointed by Canal Zone Governor JL Schley studied the feasibility of moving the Dredging Division to Gamboa the population was 251 including just 10 Americans The first Dredging Division families began moving into the newly built town of Gamboa in September 1936 Within a year the towns population jumped to 1419 and by 1942 the town reached its peak population3853

The new residents of Gamboa built their civic center with their own hands and funds It was initially used as a USO to entertain troops stationed in nearby hills but later became headquarters of the Civic Council The Civic Council and Gamboas residents also built the Gamboa Golf and Country Club on the Gamboa Ridge overlooking the Chagres river The men in the town hammered sawed and poured concrete while the women brought picnic lunches and tended barbecues The Club was officially opened on January 1 1939 and eventually included a 9hole golf course

Gamboa like most Canal Zone towns had its own commissary post office school churches five of them railroad station fire station and gas station For much of the towns history Gamboas nonUS nonwhite population lived in a separate part of town called Santa Cruz This included 50 families moved from La Boca in October 1954 when that town was depopulated and converted into a white housing area

Not all Gamboans worked for the Dredging Division Because of its remote location and distance from other Canal Zone towns Gamboa was seen as less desirable than some of the other Panama Canal CompanyCanal Zone Governments townships and since housing in the Canal Zone was assigned based on seniority many of the new arrivals to the Zone as it became known to its residents Zonians were initially assigned housing here before becoming eligible for housing in other towns US military personnel and their dependents lived in Gamboa during the 1940s due to the shortage of housing on the local military bases US personnel continued living in Gamboa until the total withdrawal of US troops from Panama in 1999

Over time as the Panama Canal CompanyCanal Zone Government began to transfer operations to Panama following the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties some of the services offered in Gamboa were shut down The most visible closures were the commissary and movie theater which were boarded up throughout the 1980s The demise of the Panama Railroad in the late 1980s further cut the town off from the rest of the Canal area

Gamboas elementary school was built in 1937 by the Panama Canal CompanyCanal Zone Government Division of Schools It consisted of 3 classrooms a library and principals office upstairs with a kindergarten classroom underneath The school was transferred to the Department of Defense Dependents Schools DoDDS in 1979 after the abolition of the Canal Zone and its government That school year its total enrollment was 115 Three US grade school teachers were employed and classes were paired up with first and second grade sharing one room third and fourth grade sharing a room and fifth and sixth grade sharing the third classroom A physical education teacher was also employed for the schools gymnasium which was inside a separate building Since December 1980 a small space underneath the school has operated as a minishopette Total enrollment for the 19871988 school year was down to 53 In June 1988 with a projected enrollment of just 40 students for the 19881989 school year DoDDS closed the Gamboa Elementary School Starting in 1988 all students were bused to Balboa Elementary Following Operation Just Cause in December 1989 the school building was used as a local headquarters for US Military Police

Gamboas golf course became a Boy Scout camp for several years but remained inactive in the last years of the Treaty reversion period

The town of Gamboa is still inhabited but as a shadow of its former self maintained but without the vibrancy and civic spirit it once enjoyed Many of its houses are not inhabited and several public buildings are underutilized It remains the primary headquarters of the Dredging Division of the Panama Canal Authority formerly PCC

The Dredging Divisions docks are used by light ferries to reach the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute STRI facilities at Barro Colorado Island

Gamboa is home to caymans crocodiles iguanas and several hundred bird species Given its location at the end of the road and the single road connecting it to the rest of the Canal Zone Gamboa is adjacent to significant tracts of relatively undisturbed rainforest A trail that follows an old pipeline Pipeline Road is considered one of the best birding hikes in Panama It is one of the premiere bird watching sites in all of Central America Many amateur birdwatchers join ornithologists for yearly bird counts held near Gamboa by the Audubon Society of Panama

The old Spanish colonial era Las Cruces Trail used to carry precious metals and supplies between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans passes near Gamboa though parts of it are now underwater

In the movie The Tailor of Panama the character played by Pierce Brosnan stays at the Gamboa Rainforest Resort and has a meal at a waterside restaurant in Gamboa In the background of the opening shot of this sequence you can see the iron and wood bridge that leads to Gamboa with an ocean liner behind it

The Gamboa Rainforest Resort is a 5star hotel located in Gamboa The Resort has developed 2 Indian reservations Embera and Wounaa an aerial tram to visit the jungle canopy and many other attractions which now draw many people to the otherwise sleepy town

Insurance companies themselves as well as selfinsuring employers purchase stoploss coverage for a premium to protect themselves In the case of a participant reaching more than the specific or individual stoploss deductible 300000 for example the insurer will reimburse the insured the company not the participant for the remainder of the claim to be paid over that deductible amount

There is also typically an aggregateclaims deductible which is applied to all paid claims combined For all claims at or below their specific stoploss level if the sum of these are more than the aggregate stop loss level then the insurer will reimburse the insured for the difference

Insurance companies and health and benefits consultants typically use mathematical models analyzing historical claims data to project expected stop loss premiums into the future to control for stop loss coverage costs and estimate the value of coverage PEPM per employee per month or PEPY

Companies providing health insurance for their employees through a selfinsured plan often subscribe to stop loss policies in order to protect themselves against catastrophic claims The organization which takes the insurance policy is called the insured and the employees and other people who are covered through the policy are called participants Most of the time there is an annual limit for the stop loss amount for each participant and an aggregate amount for each policy year The premium is calculated for each employee for each month The premium is based on the number of participants age of the participants and various other information

At Lloyds of London Personal Stop Loss PSL is a type of insurance policy which limits the losses of names all of whom did and some of whom still do underwrite with unlimited liability Provided that the PSL responds to the claims made on it the unlimited liability thereby becomes to some extent limited

PSL policies are not always available at all Some are available as mutuals and in the event that the market suffers large losses may be unable to respond to any great extent

Backdraft drink
The Backdraft is a cocktail that is noted for its elaborate preparation and potency Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container such as an upside down pint glass Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the Backdraft drink The combination of warm alcohol followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol makes the drinking of this drink difficult and while it tends not to have an immediate effect since it is drunk quickly the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks and produces a more profound impact

The procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect The alcohols listed can be substituted with others as there are various recipes However the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink

A classic Backdraft is prepared by pouring equal amounts of Drambuie and Grand Marnier into a snifter The mixture is set alight and after a few seconds extinguished by having the imbiber seal the top of the glass with their hand although often a coaster or saucer is used instead Once the flame is out a straw is inserted keeping as much of the seal intact as possible to contain the vapors

Both the liquid and the vapors are then consumed through the straw

Drambuie and Grand Marnier will be extremely difficult to ignite if not impossible so backdrafts are commonly done with 1 part Grand Marnier and 1 part 151

The procedure is as follows


When a gas is heated its volume increases It will displace cooler gases as it expands If this is done in a partially enclosed space and the vessel allowed to be full of hot gas when the heat is taken away the gases cool and as they do the amount of liquids that the gas can hold will decrease Therefore most of the moisture and alcohol held in the gas will condense As the gas cools it decreases in volume and the pressure drops Thus when the flaming alcohol in a backdraft is covered with a pint glass over a saucer the dense cold air is replaced with less dense warm air with a lot of alcohol vapour held in it As the oxygen flow to the fire is restricted the remaining oxygen is used up and the fire in the pint glass goes out removing the heat source The alcoholladen warm air now in the glass cools and begins to create a pressure difference The air outside the pint glass forces its way into the partially evacuated pint glass and is responsible for pushing any liquid at the outside bottom of the pint glass further inside as the seal of the glass and the saucer is not perfect as it begins to equalise the pressure difference Once the majority of the liquid is inside the upside down pint glass sometimes further air can be seen to bubble up into the glass At some point an equilibrium will occur where the pressure difference between inside and outside of the glass is equal to the pressure of the column of liquid held up inside and this will hold the liquid inside the glass Sometimes when a good seal is made the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the glass exerts a great enough force that when the glass is lifted the saucer will remain stuck to its underside

When the pint glass is removed ice is immediately added thus causing the condensation of the alcohol vapour creating a white mist in the glass by a process fairly similar to the formation of contrails By covering the glass with the hand this vapour is trapped until it is extracted by the process of inhalation usually through a straw

Lim kinase
LIM kinase1 LIMK1 and LIM kinase2 LIMK2 are actinbinding kinases that phosphorylate members of the ADFcofilin family of actin binding and filament severing proteins ADFcofilin are the only substrates yet identified for the LIM kinases LIM kinases directly phosphorylate and inactivate members of the cofilin family resulting in stabilization of filamentous Factin Lim kinases are activated by signaling through small GTPases of the Rho family Upstream LIMK1 is regulated by Pak1 and LIMK2 by the Rhodependent kinase ROCK Lim Kinases are activated by PAK p21activated kinase Recent work indicates that LIMK activity is also modulated by HIV1 viral proteins

There are approximately 40 known eukaryotic LIM proteins so named for the LIM domains they contain LIM domains are highly conserved cysteinerich structures containing 2 zinc fingers Although zinc fingers usually function by binding to DNA or RNA the LIM motif probably mediates proteinprotein interactions LIM kinase1 and LIM kinase2 belong to a small subfamily with a unique combination of 2 Nterminal LIM motifs and a Cterminal protein kinase domain LIMK1 is likely to be a component of an intracellular signaling pathway and may be involved in brain development LIMK1 hemizygosity is implicated in the impaired visuospatial constructive cognition of Williams syndrome

Tin ceiling
A tin ceiling is an architectural element consisting of a ceiling finished with plates of tin with designs pressed into them that was very popular in Victorian buildings in North America in the late 19th and early 20th century They were also popular in Australia where they were commonly known as pressed metal ceilings or Wunderlich ceilings after the main Australian manufacturer Wunderlich They were also used in South Africa 

Tin ceilings were introduced to North America as an affordable alternative to the exquisite plasterwork used in European homes They gained popularity in the late 1800s as Americans sought sophisticated interior design Durable lightweight and fireproof tin ceilings were appealing to home and business owners alike as a functionally attractive design element that was readily available Important critics such as John Ruskin George Gilbert Scott Charles Eastlake and William Morris debated the implications of faux materials These critics believed it was morally wrong and deceptive to imitate another material and blamed the degradation of society towards the art of shamming rather than honesty in architecture Nevertheless tin ceilings lasted longer than plaster ones and were easier to clean They encapsulated ideas of democracy making such decoration available to the middle class majority who supported the machine production

Decorative metal ceilings were first made of corrugated iron sheets appearing in the United States by the early 1870s It was during the late Victorian era that thin rolled tinplate was being massproduced Tinplate was originally made from dipping iron in molten tin in order to prevent rust Later steel replaced iron as the more costeffective solution Tinplate was not the only sheet metal used to make stamped ceilings Copper lead known as ternplate and zinc were other common Architectural metals in the industry 

Between 1890 and 1930 approximately fortyfive companies in the United States marketed metal ceilings most were in Ohio Pennsylvania and New York located along railroad lines that served as the main routes for delivering the pressed metal products directly to contractors The Wheeling Corrugating Company out of Wheeling West Virginia became the leading tin ceiling manufacturer in the late 1800s At that time Wheeling Corrugating was a large steel mill that also made products from their steel sheets such as roofing and siding 

Sheets of tin were stamped one at a time using rope drop hammers and cast iron molds Using this method of production metal was sandwiched between two interlocking tools The top tool or ram was lifted up by a rope or chain then dropped down onto the bottom die smashing into the metal that was underneath and permanently embedding intricate patterns into the tin Someone who saw the merit of this modern machine for its artistic potential was Frank Lloyd Wright In his articles The Art and Craft of the Machine and In the Cause of Architecture the series published by Architectural Record Wright elaborates on his modern theory of science and art and the role of the machine in the future of art

Tin ceilings were traditionally painted white to give the appearance of handcarved or molded plaster They were incorporated into residential living rooms and parlors as well as schools hospitals and commercial businesses where painted tin was often used as wainscoting

In the 1930s tin ceilings began to lose their popularity and steel materials became scarce because of the effort to collect scrap metal during WWII Many sheet metal companies began making other products in order to stay in business In the 21st century some renewed interest has been shown in tin ceilings The increase in interest has stemmed from businesses that were renovating and an interest to return to the nostalgia of the turn of the century Still to this today there exists a manufacturing company by the name of WF Norman Corporation that produces original tin ceilings and ornaments from the same rope drop hammers as it once did in 1898 Several other companies offer conventional tin ceilings as well as panels made to fit into a dropceiling grid

Tin ceilings were built to last and in the absence of prolonged moisture damage leading to corrosion they usually did however the wear and tear over the hundred years since the heyday of tin has led to a burgeoning restoration industry Magazines such as The OldHouse Journal were created to offer articles about restoration repair and installation practices for historic preservation of tin ceilings 

Environmental hazards from the lead paint used on turn of the century tin ceilings mean that this is a job for experts in the field Often restoration is achieved by simply stripping old paint treating the metal with a protective base coat patching minor damaged areas and repainting In some cases where small sections of a ceiling have been damaged partial restoration is needed Panels can be easily replaced through companies that still manufacture original design components If however a ceiling requires a historic pattern that is no longer in production good quality panels from the existing ceiling may be used to create a mold and new customized tin can be pressed 

If full restoration is needed meaning no part of the existing ceiling remains structurally sound a professional can help design a new ceiling appropriate for the period and structure using existing molds or creating reproductions based on photographic evidence or architectural drawings This latter method can be extremely expensive and is not cost effective due to the cost of making a custom mold for the panel and usually the metal trim that was also used with the original project

More detailed information for repair and replacement of decorative metal ceilings can be found in the National Park Service Technical Preservation Services

Several companies now offer handpainted finishes for metalwork as well as a more permanent look that can be achieved with powdercoated finishes For the low end of the market imitation panels are pressed from plastic or aluminum Tin is now fashionably used for art work back splashes cabinet faces wainscoting and much more For over 100 years the tin panel was made with nail rails around the outside of the panel designed to overlap each other Panels were nailed into wood furring strips which were prevalent prior to the invention of plywood Today nail up panels can be easily brad nailed or hand nailed into plywood without the need for the original furring strips There is also a patented interlocking tin panel that will screw directly into existing drywallpopcornplaster ceilings without the need for extensive plywood installation Tin panels today are made in and sizes for easier handling and oneperson installation Today most tin ceiling manufacturers actually use recycled blackplate steel in a thickness of only 010 or 1100th of an inch There are some manufacturers who also use actual tin plated steel which is simply the blackplate steel with a thin coating of bright tin plate adhered to the base metal Other manufacturers utilize aluminum as it is rustproof and will last a lifetime

This finish is also an option with dropped ceilings

Brijmohan Lall Munjal 1 July 1923 1 November 2015 was an Indian businessman founder and patriarch of Indias largest two wheeler company the Hero MotoCorp

Munjal was born in 1923 at Kamalia district Toba Tek Singh in unpartitioned Punjab British India Kamalia is now in Pakistan He was from a simple middleclass AroraKhatri family After completing his formal education he worked at the Army Ordnance Factory before moving his base to India after partition

In 1954 Hero Cycles moved up the value chain by making a shift from supplying to manufacturing handlebars front forks and chains In 1956 the Punjab Government issued tender notices for twelve new industrial licenses to make bicycles in Ludhiana Munjal and his brothers participated in the bid and won the contract Hero Cycles was registered as a largescale industrial unit with capital partly financed by the Government of Punjab

In 1961 Rockman Cycles Industries was established to manufacture bicycle chains and hubs Under Munjals leadership Hero Cycles was the first company to export bicycles on such a large scale In 1975 the company had become the largest bicycle manufacturer in India By 1986 Hero Cycles entered the Guinness Book of Records as the largest manufacturers of bicycles in the world

Before entering into a joint venture with the Honda Motors Munjal started a Majestic Auto and started manufacturing of the Hero Majestic Moped To manufacture motor cycles in 1984 the Hero Group started a joint venture with Hero Honda and established a plant at Dharuhera Haryana The Hero Group became so large that by 2002 it had sold 86 million bicycles and was producing 16000 motorcycles a day

After the Hero Honda Motors joint venture broke up in August 2011 Heros board of directors agreed to pay royalties to Honda to continue to produce the Hero Honda until 2013 due to the popularity and ubiquity of the Hero Honda brand in the Asia Pacific region as Hero Honda Brand was trusted among the best in the Product reliability and customer satisfaction

The separation gave an opportunity for Hero to expand its market globally with the name Hero MotoCorp Previously it had not been permitted for Hero Honda to sell their bikes outside the Asia Pacific and in countries where Honda operated

In the first week of August 2013 the company recorded a benchmark never before reached by an Indian twowheel vehicle industry manufacturer by producing 50 million bikes

Korean tea
Korean tea is a beverage consisting of boiled water infused with leaves such as the tea plant Camellia sinensis roots flowers fruits grains edible mushrooms or seaweed 

According to the Record of Gaya cited in the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms the legendary queen Heo Hwangok a princess of Ayodhya brought the Camellia sinensis var assamica tea plant from India to Korea and planted it on Baegwolsan a mountain that borders the city of Changwon In practice however Labrador tea and fruit teas such as magnolia berry tea and goji berry tea were more widely used in the Samhan Era instead

It is a widely held belief that the systematic planting of tea bushes began with the introduction of Chinese tea culture by Buddhist monks some centuries later Some of the earliest Buddhist temples in Korea such as Bulgapsa Bulhoesa and Hwaeomsa claim to be the birthplace of Korean tea culture The import of Chinese tea products started during the reign of Queen Seondeok of Silla 631647 when two types of tea bricks jeoncha  and dancha  were imported from the Tang Empire In 765 a Buddhist monk is said to have presented an offering of the tea to King Gyeongdeok and the Buddha Camellia sinensis tea plants spread throughout the country in 828 when King Heungdeok received seeds from the Tang Empire and sent them to be planted on the Jirisan mountain Tea was usually offered to the Buddha as well as to the spirits of deceased ancestors

Tea culture continued to prosper during the Goryeo Dynasty Tea offering was a part of the biggest national ceremonies such as Yeondeunghoe and Palgwanhoe and tea towns were formed around temples During the reign of King Myeongjong 11311202 SeonBuddhist manners of ceremony prevailed Jeong Mongju and other scholars enjoyed tea poetry dasi  and tea meetings dahoe  The state of daseonilchi  tea and seon in accord was eulogized

During the Joseon Dynasty 13921910 Korean tea culture underwent secularization  The royal family and aristocracy used tea for simple rites a practice referred to as darye  tea rite which is often translated as etiquette for tea Towards the end of the Joseon Dynasty commoners adopted the practice of using tea for ancestral rites The word charye  tea rite cognate to darye now refers to jesa ancestral rite In the past the two terms were synonymous as ancestral rites often involved offerings of tea to the ancestors Wedding ceremonies also included tea offerings The practice of packing tea into small cakes which lost popularity in China during the 14th century continued in Korea until the 19th century

In 1895 King Gojong of the Korean Empire used coffee for the first time In 1896 grocery stores began to have tea rooms as annexes and the first modern tea house was established in 1924

Although tea from the Camellia sinensis plant is not as popular as coffee in South Korea  with the annual South Korean tea consumption at per capita compared to for coffee  grain teas are served in many restaurants instead of water Herbal and fruit teas are commonly served both hot and cold

<doc id="7725524" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725524" title="Colour centre">
Colour centre
The colour centre is a region in the brain primarily responsible for visual perception and cortical processing of colour signals received by the eye which ultimately results in colour vision The colour centre in humans is thought to be located in the ventral occipital lobe as part of the visual system in addition to other areas responsible for recognizing and processing specific visual stimuli such as faces words and objects Many functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies in both humans and macaque monkeys have shown colour stimuli to activate multiple areas in the brain including the fusiform gyrus and the lingual gyrus These areas as well as others identified as having a role in colour vision processing are collectively labelled visual area 4 V4 The exact mechanisms location and function of V4 are still being investigated

The primary part of the visual cortex V1 is located in the calcarine sulcus and is the first cortical area involved in visual processing It receives visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus which is located in the thalamus V1 sends the visual information received from the LGN to other extrastriate cortex areas for higher order processing This higher order processing includes the recognition of shapes motion and colour

V1 has multiple areas that are coloursensitive which indicates that colour processing is not limited to one area According to a paper by Dr Robert Shapley V1 has an important role in colour perception fMRI experimental results showed that V1 has two kinds of colour sensitive neurons singleopponent and doubleopponent cells These cells are integral in the opponent process of interpreting colour signals Singleopponent neurons respond to large areas of colour This is advantageous for recognizing large colour scenes and atmospheres In comparison double opponent cells respond to patterns textures and colour boundaries This is more important for perceiving the colour of objects and pictures The doubleopponent cells are receptive to opposite inputs from different cone cells in the retina This is ideal for identifying contrasting colours such as red and green 1 Doubleopponent cells are particularly important in computing local cone ratios from visual information from their receptive fields

Single opponent coloursensitive neurons can be divided into two categories depending on the signals they receive from the cone cells LM neurons and SLM neurons The three types of cone cells small S medium M and long L detect different wavelengths across the visible spectrum S cone cells can see short wavelength colours which corresponds to violet and blue Similarly M cells detect medium wavelength colours such as green and yellow and L cells detect long wavelength colours like red LM neurons also called redgreen opponent cells receive input from long wavelength cones opposed by input from medium wavelength cones SLM neurons receive input from Scells and is opposed by a sum of the L and Mcell inputs SLM neurons are also called blueyellow opponent cells The opposition between the colours allows the visual system to interpret differences in colour which is ultimately more efficient than processing colours separately

The primary visual cortex V1 sends visual information to the extrastriate cortical areas for higher order visual processing These extrastriate cortical areas are located anterior to the occipital lobe The main ones are designated as visual areas V2 V3 V4 and V5MT Each area can have multiple functions Recent findings have shown that the colour centre is neither isolated nor traceable to a single area in the visual cortex Rather there are multiple areas that possibly have different roles in the ability to process colour stimulus

Anatomical and physiological studies have established that the colour centre begins in V1 and sends signals to extrastriate areas V2 and V4 for further processing V4 in particular is an area of interest because of the strength of the colour receptive fields in its neurons V4 was initially identified in macaque monkey visual cortex experiments Originally it was proposed that colour was selectively processed in V4 However this hypothesis was later rejected in favour of another hypothesis which suggested that V4 and other areas around V4 work together to process colour in the form of multiple colour selective regions After identification of V4 as the colourselective region in macaque monkeys scientists began searching for a homologous structure in the human cortex Using fMRI brain imaging scientists found three main areas stimulated by colour V1 an area in the ventral occipital lobe specifically the lingual gyrus which was designated as human V4 or hV4 and another area located anteriorly in the fusiform gyrus designated as V4

The purpose of V4 has changed dynamically as new studies are performed Since V4 responds strongly to colour in both macaque monkeys and humans it has become an area of interest to scientists The V4 area was originally attributed to colour selectivity but new evidence has shown that V4 as well as other areas of the visual cortex are receptive to various inputs V4 neurons are receptive to a number of properties such as colour brightness and texture It is also involved in processing shape orientation curvature motion and depth

The actual organization of hV4 in the cortex is still being investigated In the macaque monkey V4 spans the dorsal and ventral occipital lobe Human experiments have shown that V4 only spans the ventral portion This led to distinguishing hV4 from the macaque V4 A recent study from Winawer et al analysing fMRI measurements to map the hV4 and ventral occipital areas showed variances between subjects used for hV4 mapping was at first attributed to instrumentation error but Winawer argued that the sinuses in the brain interfered with fMRI measurements Two models for hV4 were tested one model had hV4 completely in the ventral side and the second model had hV4 split into dorsal and ventral sections It was concluded that it was still difficult to map the activity of hV4 and that further investigation was required However other evidence such as lesions in the ventral occipital lobe causing achromatopsia suggested that the ventral occipital area plays an important role in colour vision

The search for the human equivalent of V4 led to the discovery of other areas that were stimulated by colour The most significant was an area anterior in the ventral occipital lobe subsequently named V4 Further fMRI experiments found that V4 had a different function than V4 but worked cooperatively with it V4 is involved in a number of processes and is active during tasks requiring colour ordering imagery knowledge about colour colour illusions and object colour

The V4 and V4 areas are separate entities but because of their close proximity in the fusiform gyrus these two areas are often collectively called the V4complex Research into the V4complex discovered that different chromatic stimulations activated either the V4 or the V4 area and some stimulation parameters activated both For example naturally coloured images activated V4 more powerfully than V4 Unnaturally coloured images activated both V4 and V4 equally It was concluded that the two subdivisions cooperate with each other in order to generate colour images but they are also functionally separate

A study by Nunn et al on the activation of the V4complex in people with visual synaesthesia from hearing spoken words was used to predict the location of the colour centre Synaesthesia is the phenomenon where a sensory stimulus produces an automatic and involuntary reaction in a different sensation In this study people who would see colours upon hearing words were studied to see if the colour reaction could be traced to a specific cortical area fMRI results showed that the left fusiform gyrus an area consistent with V4 was activated when the subjects spoke They also found a simultaneous activation of V4 There was little activity in areas V1 and V2 These results validated the existence of the V4complex in humans as an area specialized for colour vision

V2 also called the prestriate cortex is believed to have a small role in colour processing by projecting signals from V1 to the V4complex Whether or not colour selective cells are present in V2 is still being investigated Some optical imaging studies have found small clusters of redgreen colour selective cells in V1 and V2 but not any blueyellow colour selective cells Other studies have shown that V2 is activated by colour stimuli but not colour after images8 V4 also has feedback on V2 suggesting that there is a defined network of communication between the multiple areas of the visual cortex When GABA an inhibitory neurotransmitter was injected into V4 cells V2 cells experienced a significant decrease in excitability

Functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI for short has been key in determining the colour selective regions in the visual cortex fMRI is able to track brain activity by measuring blood flow throughout the brain Areas that have more blood flowing to them indicates an occurrence of neuronal activity This change in blood flow is called haemodynamic response Among the benefits of fMRI includes dynamic realtime mapping of cortical processes However fMRI cannot track the actual firing of neurons which happen on a millisecond timescale but it can track the haemodynamic response which happens on a seconds timescale This method is ideal for tracking colour selective neurons because colour perception results in a visual afterimage that can be observed in the neurons which lasts about 15 seconds

Sakai et al used fMRI to observe whether activation of the fusiform gyrus correlated with the perception of colour and the after image The subjects in the Sakai study were placed in the fMRI machine and were subsequently subjected to various visual stimuli A series of three images were shown to subjects while fMRI was used to focus on the haemodynamics of the fusiform gyrus The first image was a pattern of six coloured circles The next two images were achromatic One of the images had a grey cross and the other image had the same six circles as the first image except they were six shades of grey that correlated with the coloured images The subjects were cycled between the circle and cross images During the cross images the subjected perceived an afterimage The results of the experiment showed that there was a significant increase of activity in the fusiform gyrus when the subject viewed the colour image This provided more evidence to the existence of the colour centre outside of the primary visual cortex

Cerebral achromatopsia is a chronic condition where a person is unable to see colour but they are still able to recognize shape and form Cerebral achromatopsia differs from congenital achromatopsia in that it is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex as opposed to abnormalities in the retinal cells The search for the colour centre was motivated by the discovery that lesions in the ventral occipital lobe led to colour blindness as well as the idea that there are area specializations in the cortex Many studies have shown that lesions in the areas commonly identified as the colour centre such as V1 V2 and the V4complex lead to achromatopsia Cerebral achromatopsia occurs after injury to the lingual or fusiform gyrus the areas associated with hV4 These injuries include physical trauma stroke and tumour growth One of the primary initiatives to locating the colour centre in the visual cortex is to discover the cause and a possible treatment of cerebral achromatopsia

The extent of the symptoms and the damage is different from person to person If a person has complete achromatopsia then their entire visual field is devoid of colour A person with dyschromatopsia or incomplete achromtopsia has similar symptoms to complete achromatopsia but to a lesser degree This can occur in people who had achromatopsia but the brain recovered from the injury restoring some colour vision The person may be able to see certain colours However there are many cases where there is no recovery Finally a person with hemiachromatopsia see half of their field of vision in colour and the other half in grey The visual hemifield contralateral to a lesion in the lingual or fusiform gyrus is the one that appears grey while the ipsilateral visual hemifield appears in colour The variance in symptoms emphasizes the need to understand the architecture of the colour centre in order to better diagnose and possible treat cerebral achromotopsia

Bahram horse
Bahram 19321956 was an Irishbred Englishtrained Thoroughbred racehorse In a career which lasted from July 1934 until September 1935 he was undefeated in nine races The leading British twoyearold of 1934 he went on to take the Triple Crown in 1935 by winning the 2000 Guineas Stakes Epsom Derby and St Leger Stakes He was retired to stud at the end of the year After a promising start to his stud career in Britain he was exported to the United States where he had moderate success before being exported again to Argentina

Bahram was a bay horse with a white star and strip foaled at the HH Aga Khan IIIs stud farm on The Curragh Ireland He was by the highly successful stallion Blandford who sired four Derby winners and was British Champion sire on three occasions His dam Friars Daughter was inbred to St Simon in the third and fourth generations Friars Daughter won one small race but was a good broodmare who produced eleven winners of over 58000 including Dastur who finished runnerup in all three legs of the Triple Crown in 1932 Bahram stood 162 hands high had a good temperament and was described by equine experts as having flawless conformation The Aga Khan originally registered the colt as Bahman but renamed him in honour of his cousin who was killed in the torpedoing of the SS Sussex in 1916 Bahram was trained by Frank Butters for the Aga Khan at Newmarket in England His regular rider was the veteran jockey Frederick Fox 18881945

Bahram made his debut in the valuable National Breeders Produce Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse in July for which he started a 201 outsider He won by a neck from his more fancied stable companion Theft who had won the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot in a result which reportedly stunned the crowd Later in July Bahram won the Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood before being sent to York for the Gimcrack Stakes in which he ran lazily and had to be driven out to win by a length from Consequential

In the autumn he was sent to Newmarket where he won the Boscawen Stakes before contesting the Middle Park Stakes one of the years most prestigious races for juveniles which he won in a record time of 1112 In the Free Handicap a rating of the seasons best twoyearolds Bahram was awarded top weight of 133 pounds a pound ahead of his stable companions Theft and Hairan

By the spring of 1935 Bahram had grown into a handsome impressive horse with a placid lazy temperament He missed an intended run at Newmarkets Craven meeting in April and made his first appearance of the season in the 2000 Guineas Ridden by Freddie Fox he started at odds of 72 in a field of sixteen runners He won comfortably by one and a half lengths from Theft with Sea Bequest two lengths away in third

A month after his win at Newmarket Bahram started 54 favourite for the Derby at Epsom The race was run in bright sunshine despite previous heavy rain and was attended by a crowd estimated at 500000 including King George V who was celebrating his Silver Jubilee Bahram was towards the rear of the field in the early stages but was always travelling well Fox moved him up to third place at Tattenham corner before accelerating into the lead early in the straight He won very comfortably by two lengths from Robin Goodfellow and Field Trial with Theft in fourth Later in June Bahram started at odds of 18 in the St Jamess Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot and won from Portfolio In August Bahrams training was delayed by the coughing epidemic which struck many British stables in late summer

At Doncaster in September Bahram started 411 favourite for the St Leger Stakes in his bid to become the first winner of the traditional Triple Crown since Rock Sand in 1903 Pommern Gay Crusader and Gainsborough had won wartime Triple Crowns but these included substitute races run at Newmarket Since Rock Sand four colts had attempted the feat but St Amant sixth in 1904 Minoru 4th in 1909 Manna tenth in 1925 and Cameronian tenth and last in 1931 had all been wellbeaten at Doncaster He was ridden by Charlie Smirke Fox having sustained serious injuries in a fall the previous day Bahram won very easily by five lengths from Solar Ray with Buckleigh a further three lengths away in third After the race Smirke claimed that Bahram could have won carrying 12 Stone and two riders

On Bahrams retirement he was described as the Horse of the Century by his owner an assessment with which the Daily Mail concurred although The Times regarded him as inferior to Windsor Lad

In their book A Century of Champions John Randall and Tony Morris rated Bahram the twentyeighth best horse of the 20th Century and the seventh best Derby winner behind SeaBird Hyperion Mill Reef Nijinsky Shergar and Windsor Lad

Bahram was reportedly even lazier at home than he was on the racecourse making him a difficult horse to assess His trainer Frank Butters admitted that I never knew how good he was

At the end of the 1935 racing season Bahram was retired to Egerton Stud in Newmarket where he stood at a service fee of 500 guineas per mare With just two crops racing Bahram became the second leading sire in 1940 and leading juvenile sire of 1941 Among his English progeny were Big Game 2000 Guineas and Champion Stakes Persian Gulf winner of the Coronation Cup and sire of the Derby winner Parthia Turkhan winner of the 1940 St Leger Stakes and Irish Derby and Zabara and the winners of 469 races Bahram was also the damsire of Noor who competed successfully in England as well as in America where he would be inducted into the United States National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame

Following the German occupation of France during World War II the Aga Khan fled France to the safety of Switzerland and in September 1940 sold Bahram for 40000 to an American syndicate made up of Walter P Chrysler Jr Alfred G Vanderbilt II James Cox Brady Jr and Sylvester Labrot Jr In 1941 the horse was brought to Vanderbilts Sagamore Stud in Maryland then to Walter Chrysler Jrs North Wales Stud in Warrenton Virginia However there was considerable resentment amongst British breeders against the Aga Khan for selling to overseas buyers all five of his Derby winners particularly the three from the Blandford line Bahram Blenheim and Blenheims son Mahmoud All of them were considered a severe loss to British breeding stock

In the US Bahram sired the winners of 660 races worth two million dollars In 1946 Bahram was sold for a reported 130000 to a stud farm in Argentina where he met with only modest success before his death at 24 years of age in 1956

Ronald Lockley
Ronald Mathias Lockley 8 November 1903  12 April 2000 was a Welsh ornithologist and naturalist He wrote over fifty books on natural history including a major study of shearwaters and many articles He is perhaps best known for his book The Private Life of the Rabbit

Lockley was born in Cardiff and grew up in the suburb of Whitchurch where his mother ran a boarding school While still at school he spent his weekends and summer holidays living rough in the woods and wetlands that now form the Glamorganshire Canal local nature reserve

After leaving school he established a small poultry farm with his sister near St Mellons Cardiff

His son is the palaeontologist Martin Lockley

In 1927 with his first wife Doris Shellard he took a 21year lease of Skokholm a small island some four miles off the western tip of Pembrokeshire which was inhabited only by rabbits and seabirds Attempts to make a living from catching and selling rabbits and breeding chinchilla rabbits were abandoned when he found he could make a better living writing articles and books He began to study migratory birds from 1928 establishing the first British bird observatory in 1933 and carrying out extensive pioneering research on breeding Manx shearwaters Atlantic puffins and European stormpetrels He was encouraged to record the exact incubation and fledging period of the Manx shearwater by Harry Witherby the then editor of British Birds He provided the initial catalyst for the entire British Bird Observatory movement which following the wartime interruption reached its zenith in the fifties He described his research in several books including Dream Island 1930 Island Days 1934 and I Know an Island 1938 The work brought him to the notice of a wider circle of conservationists and naturalists among them Peter Scott and Julian Huxley Lockleys notable scientific monograph Shearwaters is a result of a twelve years study He founded the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which later became the West Wales Field Society He urged the broadening of the activities of the original Society and the extension of its area to include the whole of West Wales and it was at his insistence that the West Wales Field Society was incorporated as the West Wales Naturalists Trust

With Julian Huxley he made one of the first professional BFI nature films The Private Life of the Gannets 1934 which won an Oscar

Lockley continued farming on the mainland when Skokholm was used by the military during the Second World War He played a key part in the preliminary survey of the natural history of Skomer Island in 1946 reestablishing Skokholm as a bird observatory and establishing the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies in Dale Fort He played a leading role in setting up the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park in 1952 and in mapping out the coastal footpath around the county Living at Orielton a large estate near Pembroke he undertook an intensive fouryear scientific study of rabbit behaviour for the British Nature Conservancy during the 1950s As chairman of the West Wales Field Society he also led an unsuccessful campaign against the building of a large oil refinery at Milford Haven

His belief that successive British governments were not sufficiently aware of the threat to the landscape from industrial development led to his decision to emigrate to New Zealand in 1970 with his third wife There he continued to write mostly about islands and birds but also novels and to travel among the islands of Polynesia and in the Antarctic

Lockley was awarded an Honorary MSc by the University of Wales in 1977 in recognition of his distinction as a naturalist In 1993 he was awarded the Union Medal of the British Ornithologists Union He died in 2000 aged 96 His ashes were scattered from the boat Dale Princess in the waters just off Skokholm Island in 2000

Lockleys The Private Life of the Rabbit 1964 played an important role in the plot development of his friend Richard Adamss childrens book Watership Down The New York Times obituary observed It was a rigorously factual work with none of the anthropomorphic sentimentality that infused Watership with its charm but it bristled with insights With Lockleys permission Adams introduced him alongside Sir Peter Scott as a character in his later novel The Plague Dogs 1977

Books authored or coauthored by Lockley


This bibliography is believed to be a complete list of all Lockleys book titles but many of his books have been reprinted and published in different editions He was also a prolific writer of articles many of them for Countryman magazine in the 1930s 40s and 50s

A 1947 edition of I Know an Island was illustrated by James Lucas

Gassires Lute
Gassires Lute is a West African epic collected by Leo Frobenius and published in his collection Atlantis Volksmarchen und Volksdichtung Afrikas vol 6 1921 The English translation is by Douglas Fox published in African Genesis first printed 1937 Alta Jablow wrote a study of the epic that appeared in 1973

This lyrical epic narrative tells the story of a prince that becomes a bard 

Gassire is a prince who would be the successor of his father but his father is very powerful Gassire wants to be king very badly and becomes a mighty warrior to demonstrate his strength Gassire consults an old wiseman and the old wiseman tells him that Gassire will abandon his quest to be king to play the lute He also tells him that he will not be king and other people will become king after the death of his father and the empire will fall He hears the sound of the lute and has one made for him because he loves the sound so much When he tries to play the lute it does not produce any sound He hears that it can only be played if he goes into battle He then hears that his sons must go to battle for the lute to play in battle seven of his sons die but the lute will still not play The people exiled him because of his violence and disregard for his family He went into the desert with his one remaining son his wives and a few loyal friends He finally can play the lute when he sings of the empire and the story provides lessons to all the people who listenStern

While the story has enchanted readers since it first appeared it should be approached with dire caution Frobenius attributes it to the Soninke people of West Africa the people associated with the Empire of Wagadu or Ghana and the name Gassire is in fact the Soninke word for a bardsinger known as griots elsewhere in Western Africa While many of the stories Frobenius collected can be confirmed by modern research in the oral tradition this story stands alone and no analogue has yet been reported

Deception 1946 film
Deception is a 1946 movie released by Warner Brothers and directed by Irving Rapper The film is based on the play Monsieur Lamberthier by Louis Verneuil The screenplay was written by John Collier and Joseph Than It stars Bette Davis Paul Henreid and Claude Rains who had also appeared together in the highly successful Now Voyager 1942

Christine Radcliffe Bette Davis runs up the stairs of a college concert hall in the rain The hall is filled with enraptured students and her eyes fill with tears as she recognizes the cellist on stage Karel Novak Paul Henreid who spent the war trapped in neutral Sweden After the performance Novak is mobbed by wellwishers and a student reporter questions him about his favorite composers Novak lists some famous ones then adds And of course Hollenius

Novak returns to his dressing room Christine enters and their eyes meet in his mirror The couple embraces while Christine cries I thought you were dead I saw them kill you

Karel and Christine return to her apartment Karel becomes suspicious of the rare artwork on display and the fur coat hanging in the closet Christine has told Karel that she is living a precarious existence as a pianist but this conflicts with the evidence in the apartment He confronts her but frightens himself with his own vehemence and apologises to her then says hes leaving She stops him with the confession she lowered herself to taking rich untalented pupils who gifted her with the suspicious items

They marry but the composer Alexander Hollenius Claude Rains makes a dramatic entrance at their wedding reception It is evident he is jealous and the stress leads him to break a wine glass without deliberate intent Hollenius soon gives Novak a manuscript score of his new cello concerto which Novak agrees to perform at its premiere It becomes apparent to Christine that a cellist in the orchestra Bertram Gribble John Abbott is being tutored in the solo part by Hollenius Suspecting the sabotage of her husbands career she unsuccessfully attempts to bribe Gribble into not cooperating

Friction develops between Novak and Hollenius and the composer angrily breaks off a dress rehearsal on the grounds of Novaks temperamental behavior On the evening of the premiere Christine visits Hollenius who threatens to tell Novak of their love affair Distraught Christine shoots him dead

Another conductor Neilsen Einar Neilsen takes the place of the absent Hollenius and the performance is a great success While wellwishers wait Christine confesses everything to her husband and they leave the concert hall together 


The film was based on a play Monsieur Lamberthier by Louis Verneuil which was first performed in Paris in 1927 It opened on Broadway as Jealousy on October 22 1928 at Maxine Elliotts Theatre as a twohander play with only two main characters with Fay Bainter and John Halliday It was turned into a film also entitled Jealousy 1929 with Jeanne Eagels and Fredric March and directed by Jean de Limur The play was presented again on Broadway on October 1 1946 under the title Obsession at the Plymouth Theatre with Eugenie Leontovich and Basil Rathbone Warner Bros originally purchased the play as a vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck and Paul Henreid

Davis solo piano playing was performed by Shura Cherkassky Henreids cello playing was dubbed by Eleanor Aller The music for Hollenius Cello Concerto was by Erich Wolfgang Korngold who composed the music for this film Korngold subsequently expanded this material and published it as his own cello concerto

Despite the earlier success of Davis Henreid Rains and director Rapper and generally positive reviews Deception proved to be an expensive exercise for its producers With high production costs and modest cinema patronage it became the first Bette Davis film to lose money for Warner Bros

Film critic Dennis Schwartz generally liked the film writing Irving Rapper Shining VictoryNow VoyagerRhapsody in Blue helms this labored romantic melodrama a remake of the early talkie 1929 Jealousy that was also based on a Louis Verneuil play Its written by John Collier and Joseph Than  With classical music filling the background cheesy soap opera dialogue in the forefront histrionics taking over the concert hall none of the characters being likable and Bette Davis as hammy as ever this preposterous operalike tale is amazingly enjoyable as straight theatrical drama that is nevertheless campy and could easily have been treated as comedy

According to Warner Bros records the film earned 2132000 domestically and 1130000 foreign

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists

Hyde and Hare
Hyde and Hare is a 1955 Looney Tunes Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Friz Freleng The cartoon pits Bugs against Dr Jekyll who continues to turn into Mr Hyde The title is a play on the expression neither hide nor hair

Bugs comes out of his rabbit hole in a city park every morning because a kind gentleman keeps coming to feed him a carrot Well here I go again with the timid little rabbit routine Its shameful but  eh its a living At first feigning the onallfours posture of a real rabbit Bugs eventually stands up and confides that he would rather simply go home with the gentleman as a pet since it would be easier for both of them As the gentleman brings Bugs home he remarks that it is strange that Bugs calls him Doc because I happen to be a doctor The camera then pans up to show that the name above the apartment is none other than Dr Jekyll

Inside the house Bugs gets used to his new surroundings Going into a room with a door marked laboratory in search of a carrot for Bugs
Dr Jekyll sees the fizzing red potion that he knows he should not drink but he gives in and drinks the potion anyway Oh Im so ashamed He then transforms into Mr Hyde with a monstrous green face and glowing red eyes When Bugs sees him he initially thinks he is a sick person who needs to see the doctor he sits Hyde in a chair but as he goes to get the doctor Hyde swings an axe at Bugs chopping a lamp in half Bugs quickly realizes that this cackling knuckledragging axeswinging monster is not something to be heckled Bugs runs away calling out for the doctor Soon the monster reverts to Dr Jekyll Bugs still thinking that Hyde might benefit from seeing a doctor tries leading Jekyll to the patient On the way the doctor changes into Hyde After yelling for Jekyll again then seeing that suddenly Hyde is gone and the doctor is back Bugs decides they should hide in a storage room Once more Dr Jekyll transforms into Mr Hyde and Bugs having reinforced the door tears it open and escapes Bugs heads for a closet and seeing the doctor in the hallway waves him inside and shuts the door In the dark another change occurs and Bugs flees running into the laboratory

At this point once he is the doctor again Jekyll decides that hes going to pour the rest of the formula down the drain He goes into his laboratory but finds the beaker empty He asks Bugs if he drank the potion Bugs acts insulted at the idea and leaves I am going back to the park There is no question of my integrity there

Walking back to his park Bugs transforms into a monstrous green rabbit confirming Jekylls suspicion that Bugs did drink the potion The people at the park who are busy feeding the pigeons see the transformed Bugs and run away screaming Bugs who unlike Dr Jekyll retained his usual personality and is unaware of the change in his appearance wonders aloud Now whats eating THEM Hmph Youd think they never saw a rabbit before He chews on his carrot as the cartoon irises out

Oiasso
Oiasso Oiasona or Oiarso was a Basque Roman town located on the left bank of the Bidasoa estuary in the Bay of Biscay current Basque Country in Spanish territory Archaeological evidence unearthed recently pinpoints the core area of Oiasso in the old quarter of Irun Gipuzkoa by the SpanishFrench border where harbour and bath remains have been discovered However two other focuses in Cape Higuer and hermitage Ama Xantalen necropolis and mausoleum point to a wider complex outside the main nucleus

Actually some authors note that the name Oiasso may have applied to the whole valley arguing that the very name of the Bidasoa River may stem from Latin via ad Oiasso eventually rendering Bidasoa in Basque Furthermore it is widely assumed that the name for the town Oiartzun some 10km away may have developed from Oiasso A Roman road linked this spot to ancient Pompaelo all the way through the Saltus Vasconum the Vasconian wilderness with the road being built to connect the Vasconian main town to the mines of Arditurri set in the massif of Aiako Harria Romans showed an early interest on them on account of the ore largely silver and copper they could extract from them using the port and factories of Oiasso to process and dispatch the freight away

A museum was founded recently in Irun to cater for the interest the vestiges unveiled have aroused and for tourism 

Earlier it was misidentified with current San Sebastin that is still nicknamed la bella Easo The beautiful Easo a Hispanization of Oiasso

Militant use of children in Sri Lanka
Militant use of children in Sri Lanka has been an internationally recognized problem since the inception of the Sri Lankan civil war in 1983 The primary recruiters of under the age of 18 children are the rebel LTTE movement and the Karuna group a breakaway faction of the LTTE working with Sri Lanka Forces

Before 2007 the LTTE was accused of recruiting thousands of children into their ranks The LTTE has been accused of knowingly recruiting and using child soldiers as frontline troops Amid international pressure LTTE announced in July 2003 that it would stop conscripting child soldiers but both UNICEF and HRW have accused it of reneging on its promises and of conscripting Tamil children orphaned by the tsunami UNICEF claimed that LTTE recruited at least 40 children orphaned by the tsunami However from the beginning of 2007 LTTE agreed to release all of the recruits under the age of 18

According to UNICEF between November 1 2006 and August 31 2007 262 children were recruited by the LTTE this figure includes 32 children who were rerecruited after being released This number shows a significant decrease in recruitment as compared to the previous 12month period which saw the LTTE recruit 756 children of whom 97 were rerecruits
The LTTE promised that it would release all of the recruits under the age of 18 before the end of the year On 18 June 2007 the LTTE released 135 children under the age of 18 On 22 October 2007 UNICEF claimed that at least 506 child recruits under the age of 18 still remained under the LTTE UNICEF further noted that there had been a significant drop in recruitment of children by the LTTE Furthermore a report released by the LTTEs Child Protection Authority CPA in 2008 reported that fewer than 40 child soldiers under the age of 18 still remained in their forces In January 2008 the LTTE claimed that they had stopped child recruitment Despite the LTTE claims according to the UNICEF a total of 594 children aged between 12 and 18 years surrendered to armed forces during the end of the war

More recently TMVP known as the Karuna Group A Tamil paramilitary group which supports the Sri Lankan government has been held responsible for the abduction of children according to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch Allan Rock who is a special advisor to the UN Special Rapporteur for Children and Armed Conflict Dr Radhika Coomaraswamy alleged that government forces had forcibly rounded up young Tamil children to fight with Col Karunas group Colonel Karuna while categorically denying any involvement in abducting children questioned Rocks impartiality stating that Allan Rock is a former politician with links to the LTTE who had previously helped the LTTE in Canada Civilians have also complained that the TMVP is continuing to abduct children including some in their early teens for use as soldiers Allan Rock vowed that he had credible evidence for the accusations The government of Sri Lanka and the Government newspaper Daily News asked Mr Rock to produce substantive proof that Sri Lankan soldiers collaborated in child soldier recruitment The new report by the United Nations stated that TMVP still recruits children The UN further noted that children have been abducted in places like Internally Displaced Persons IDP camps in Sri Lanka

Tony Leswick
Anthony Joseph Leswick March 17 1923  July 1 2001 was a Canadian ice hockey forward who played mostly for the New York Rangers and Detroit Red Wings of the NHL Nicknamed Tough Tony and Mighty Mouse he was known also as a little pest Little because he stood just 57 tall and weighed 160lbs He is most famous for scoring the final goal in overtime of game seven of the 1954 Stanley Cup final

Leswick played his junior hockey in Saskatoon with the Dodgers and Quakers and quickly started turning heads In 1942 Leswick finally jumping into the AHL with the Cleveland Barons and scored 40 points in only 52 games He moved onto the PCHL in the following season to play for the New Westminster Royals Scoring 36 points in 19 games there he followed up his great season by joining with HMCS CHIPPAWA of the Winnipeg Navy where he helped to win the 19441945 Basil Baker trophy for interservice hockey The New York Rangers who acquired him in June 1945 had seen enough and brought him into their lineup for the remainder of the 194546 season

Leswick delivered He scored 15 goals in his shortened rookie season for the Rangers and quickly established himself as one of the few bright spots in New York He loved getting under peoples skin including that of Montreal Canadiens Rocket Richard and Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings Leswick recorded consecutive 20goal seasons in 1947 and 1948 but the Rangers continued to miss the playoffs or get knocked out in the early rounds After scoring 44 points in 194950 he was named to the NHL second allstar team During this time he formed a successful combination with Edgar Laprade and Dunc Fisher

Detroit had seen the way that Leswick would go after Howe and knew that took guts They decided to trade for Leswick after the 195051 season On June 8 Tony Leswick became a Detroit Red Wing after a blockbuster trade that saw Gaye Stewart going to New York Leswick would continue his pestering ways and was inserted on a line with Marty Pavelich and Glen Skov He would help lead Detroit to Stanley Cups in 1952 1954 and 1955 He is probably most remembered for his winning goal in game seven of the 1954 Stanley Cup finals against the Montreal Canadiens Leswick had this to say in an interview with Chuck ODonnell 

So Im just thinking of lifting the puck down deep in their end just making the safe play So I flipped it in nice and high and turned to get off the ice The next thing I know everyones celebrating It had gone in I said Youve got to be kidding It went in Get out of here 

Defenceman Doug Harvey went back to glove the puck but instead deflected it past goaltender Gerry McNeil and into the net for the gamewinning goal

Following his third Stanley Cup victory in 1955 Leswick was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks along with Glen Skov Johnny Wilson and Benny Woit for Jerry Toppazzini John McCormack Dave Creighton and Gord Hollingworth on May 27 He would score 11 goals and 11 assists in the 195556 season for Chicago before jumping to the rival WHL The Edmonton Flyers welcomed his 53 points in the 195657 season and he was invited to another AllStar team After a brief 22 games for Detroit in 1957 Leswick would again join the Edmonton Flyers until the close of the 1959 season He would play 9 games the following season for the Vancouver Canucks of the WHL before retiring from playing hockey

Leswick tried his hand at coaching starting in 1958 He replaced the current coach of the Edmonton Flyers midseason in 195758 and would continue until midseason of 195859 He felt he was more of a help to the team on the ice He would try his hand at coaching one more time with the Indianapolis CapitalsCincinnati Wings of the Central Hockey League in the 196364 season They would finish last in the league with a 12537 record and Leswick would retire from the world of hockey

M116 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that begins in Ludington at an intersection with US Highway 10 US10 at James Street and Ludington Avenue The road travels northward much of it along the shore of Lake Michigan before reaching its terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park The roadway has been in the state highway system since the late 1920s It has been realigned a few times most recently in the late 1990s

M116 begins in Ludington at the intersection of James Street and Ludington Avenue It is at this intersection where US10 turns southward and heads to the LudingtonManitowoc ferry docks From here M116 continues westward along Ludington Avenue through a mixed commercial area for about onehalf mile 08km before turning north on Lakeshore Drive The road continues as North Lakeshore Drive through resident areas and passes the Lakeview Cemetery Before passing the Lincoln Hills Golf Club M116 crosses a narrow section of Lincoln Lake and then curves westward towards the shore of Lake Michigan as it approaches the state park The route runs along the coast of Lake Michigan for the remainder of its route through an area of sand dunes until reaching its northern terminus at the entrance to Ludington State Park

Ludington State Park is bound to the west by Lake Michigan the north by sand dunes and to the east by Hamlin Lake As such M116 provides the only road access to the park from the south The park encompasses offering biking hiking fishing tubing boating and ice skating in the winter The park is also home to the tall Big Sable Point Lighthouse built in 1867 which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places
The highway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation MDOT which is responsible for maintaining and constructing transportation infrastructure in the state including highways As part of this role the department periodically conducts surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic AADT which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year In 2009 MDOT calculated that 7377vehicles used the southern section of M116 daily near the US10 junction On the north end only 859vehicles used the roadway near the state park entrance each day The highway has not been listed on the National Highway System a network of roads important to the countrys economy defense and mobility

In December 2014 Michigan Governor Rick Snyder authorized a portion of the highway in Ludington State Park between Little River and Big Sable in Mason County to be named The Paul K Butterfield II Memorial Highway in honor of that Michigan State Police Trooper who was murdered during a traffic stop there in 2013 The ceremony to do so took place in early February 2015 

M116 was first designated in May or June 1928 from the north city limit of Ludington north to the Sable River but not all of it was built and open to traffic It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US10 There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933 The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks At that time M116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street

Amorphophallus paeoniifolius
Amorphophallus paeoniifolius the elephant foot yam or whitespot giant arum is a tropical tuber crop grown primarily in Africa South Asia Southeast Asia and the tropical Pacific islands Because of its production potential and popularity as a vegetable in various cuisines it can be raised as a cash crop

The elephant foot yam is used as food in Island Southeast Asia Mainland Southeast Asia South Asia New Guinea Oceania and Madagascar Its origin and center of domestication was formerly considered to be India where it is most widely utilized as a food resource in recent times But a genetic study in 2017 have shown that Indian populations of elephant foot yams have lower genetic diversity than those in Island Southeast Asia therefore it is now believed that elephant foot yams originated from Island Southeast Asia and spread into westwards into Thailand and India resulting in three independent domestication events From Island Southeast Asia they were also spread even further west into Madagascar and eastwards to coastal New Guinea and Oceania by the Austronesian migrations Though they may have spread south into Australia without human intervention

The plant blooms annually around the beginning of the raining season The flower bud emerged from the corm as a purple shoot and later blooms as a purple inflorescence The pistillate female and staminate male flowers are on the same plant and are crowded in cylindrical masses as an inflorescence The top part is responsible for secreting mucus that gives off putrid pungent smell that is used to attract pollinating insects the middle part of the inflorescence contains staminate and the base of the inflorescence contains pistillate The stigmas of the female flowers will be receptive on the first day of the bloom when the pungent smell will draw pollinating insects inside and the inflorescence will close trapping them for a night to allow the pollen deposited on the insect to be transferred to the stigmas Later in the second day the female flower will no longer be receptive of pollens the male flowers will start to bloom and the inflorescence will open again This allows the pollen to be deposited on the emerging insects to be pollinated on different flowers while preventing the pollens from the same inflorescence to fertilize itself preventing inbreeding

After 2436 hours after the first bloom of the inflorescence the inflorescences female flowers will start developing into berries bright red fruiting bodies and other parts of the inflorescence will start wilting away The berries are red when ripe and are not quite round being or 

While the flowers are in bloom they also produce heat They die after five days

In Bangladesh it is called Ol Kochu It is usually eaten as mashed and added rearly in curries The leaves are also eaten and are used to make a special leaf based curry 

In Bihar it is used in oal curry oal bharta or chokha pickles and chutney Oal chutney is also called Barabar chutney as it has mango ginger and oal in equal quantities hence the name barabar meaning in equal amount

In Chhattisgarh it is called Zimmikanda It is eaten as curry and is a delicacy among people of Chhattisgarh
In Tripura it is called Batema and prepared by making a paste with sodium bicarbonate baking soda and water to remove its raphides calcium oxalate needles The paste is shaped into buns and boiled with water containing baking soda after which the water is discarded The buns are then cut into pieces and combined with fresh garlic paste and Mosdenga spicy paste of dried fishshrimp and chili Also the leaves and stems are eaten by chopping them into pieces and frying

In Southern India especially Kerala it is known as Chena the tuber has been a part of peoples diet for centuries It is mainly served as steamed pieces  along with traditional chutney made of green chilli coconut oil shallots and garlic although the curry preparation is also common as a side dish for rice It has served as the main source of carbohydrates especially during the famine stricken days of the region in the past along with the more popular tapioca

The elephantfoot yam is widely used in Indian medicine and is recommended as a remedy in all three of the major Indian medicinal systems Ayurveda Siddha and Unani The corm is prescribed in those systems for a variety of ailments

Paul Wolfskehl
Paul Friedrich Wolfskehl 30 June 1856 in Darmstadt  13 September 1906 in Darmstadt was a physician with an interest in mathematics He bequeathed 100000 marks equivalent to 1000000 pounds in 1997 money to the first person to prove Fermats Last Theorem

He was the younger of two sons of a banker Joseph Carl Theodor Wolfskehl 
His older brother the jurist Wilhelm Otto Wolfskehl took over the family bank after the death of his father Paul became a doctor of medicine At about this time he began to suffer from multiple sclerosis which eventually forced him to pursue another career He chose mathematics

There are a number of theories concerning the prizes origin The most romantic is that he was spurned by a young lady and decided to commit suicide but was distracted by what he thought was an error in a paper by Ernst Kummer who had detected a flaw in Augustin Cauchys attempted proof of Fermats famous problem This rekindled his will to live and in gratitude he established the prize This story was traced by Philip Davis and William Chinn in their 1969 book 31416 and All That to renowned mathematician Alexander Ostrowski who supposedly heard it from another unidentified source Another more prosaic story claims that Wolfskehl wanted to leave as little as possible to his shrewish wife Yet another story told in The man who loved only numbers by Paul Hoffman tells that Wolfskehl actually missed his supposed suicide time because he was in the library studying the Theorem Upon realizing that he concluded that the contemplation of mathematics was more rewarding than a beautiful woman so he decided not to kill himself He bankrolled the Theorem because it saved his life On June 27 1997 the prize was finally won by Andrew Wiles By then due in part to the hyperinflation Germany suffered after the end of World War I the award had dwindled to 30000

The play From Abstraction by Robert Thorogood is based on the life of Paul Wolfskehl It was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 1 November 2006 and 29 August 2008

Battle of Moncontour
The Battle of Moncontour occurred on 3 October 1569 between the Catholic forces of King Charles IX of France commanded by Henry Duke of Anjou and the Huguenots commanded by Gaspard de Coligny

Weeks before Coligny had lifted the siege of Poitou and positioned his army in hopes of gaining an advantage over the approaching Royalist forces However a flanking maneuver by SaulxTavannes forced him to reposition his forces This coincided with Henrys objective to keep Colignys army from joining Gabriel comte de Montgomerys forces 

The battle consisted of multiple charges by the royal forces during which Coligny was wounded in the jaw forcing Louis of Nassau to take command Henry was subsequently unhorsed during a charge but was saved by his bodyguards Philibert Margrave of BadenBaden who commanded the Royalist Germans was killed during a cavalry charge Nassau in turn charged the Swiss pikemen but made no headway A final charge by Swiss pikemen shattered the Huguenot landsknechts line in which over half were killed As a result three thousand Huguenots surrendered Nassau and the rest of the cavalry were able to withdraw in good order

Henry then besieged SaintJeandAngly from 16 October to 2 December Coligny regrouped marched east into the Rhone and months later marched towards Paris

NATO bombing of Novi Sad
During the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia the second largest Yugoslav city of Novi Sad was one of the cities that bore the brunt of the bombing According to NATO press releases the bombing targeted oil refineries roads bridges and telecommunications relay stations facilities which had military uses The bombing of the city caused great damage to local civilians including severe pollution and widespread ecological damage as well as lasting consequences for the well being of the population




The civilians of Novi Sad were greatly affected by the bombing of their city The citys oil refinery was bombarded daily causing severe pollution and widespread ecological damage

The bombing caused civilian deaths and injuries Those who were not directly physically harmed suffer from consequences for their physical health caused by ecological damage as well as permanent consequences for psychological health caused by almost 3 months of trauma and fear Due to the NATO attacks many in Novi Sad were left jobless

Notably NATO were accused of failing to give effective advance warning of attacks which may affect civilians as required by Protocol I One such attack where NATO was accused of this was the bombing of the Ministry of Education in Novi Sad premises which administered social welfare programmes

The NATO bombing left the city without any of its three Danube bridges communications water and electricity which severely impaired the day to day living of the residents of Novi Sad All three bridges have been rebuilt as of 2018 eelj Bridge

Water supplies including drinking water for parts of the city were cut off as a result of the bombing One attack cut off water supplies to 40000 people in Petrovaradin and severely disrupted water supplies to 300000 people in Novi Sad Services were restored only after two years partially due to funding from Britain one of the countries which bombed targets in the city in 1999

The bombing of Novi Sad had implications for the environment A United Nations study the BTF Industrial Sites and Danube missions found that there were serious environmental issues requiring immediate action some of which resulted from the bombing The bombing of Novi Sads refinery caused fires which burned 50000 tons of crude oil sending toxins and carcinogens into the air and contaminating groundwater The BTF study was complicated by the heavy pollution that existed before the bombing with the group noting that the enforced shutdown of the refinery may even have led to local improvements in the aquatic environment due to a possible reduction in chronic pollution

Once all the samples for Novi Sad Danube Mission were collated based on field observation and results from sample analysis the BTF concluded that there was no evidence of significant adverse impacts on the Danube aquatic environment as a result of air strikes on Novi Sad refinery It is thought that most of the oils and oil products released were burned and that no significant volume entered the river

The BTF study also found that prior to the air strikes local technicians helped minimise the potential harmful effects of air strikes by removing oil products that could be harmful to human health if spilt or burnt such as transformer oil containing PCBs Production was also accelerated to use up as much as possible of the crude oil intermediate products and additives and the final products were shipped to other locations The remaining oil was mixed with gasoline so that the tanks would ignite if hit rather than leak into the soil and groundwater 

Local scientists also studied the impact of the bombing NATO didnt use chemical weapons during the bombing said Dr Zorka Vukmirovi a leading environmental physicist But indirectly it caused the effects of chemical weapons use If you release so many hazardous substances major air pollutants and carcinogens in the vicinity of big cities like Belgrade and Ni it is obviously a deliberate action against the civilian population

Not until 2003 the Danube river was declared clear again It took four years of work by the Danube Commission to remove the debris of bombed bridges and ordnance The clearing of the debris was not only important for Novi Sad but for European states Hungary  Romania who were economically impacted by the blockade of river traffic to the Black sea caused by the bombing

NATO was accused of committing war crimes due to the nature of some of the bombing raids Some Novi Sad residents found it ironic that Novi Sad was so heavily targeted by NATO due to the fact that during the time of the bombing the city was ruled by the local Democratic Opposition which was against the regime in Belgrade Therefore some citizens of Novi Sad were not able to understand why the city was targeted heavily for the events in Kosovo

A press release one year on from the bombing by then NATO Secretary General Robertson claims that NATO encountered complications from Yugoslav military use of civilian buildings and human shields NATO officials have expressed deep regret at any civilian casualties it caused 

NATO claims that the bombing of targets such as bridges was aimed at impairing the Yugoslav Armys command and control structure However the efficacy of the campaign and choice of targets was brought into question by human rights groups after bridges of no conceivable strategic relevance to the military situation in Kosovo were bombed including a bridge which led to Hungary a NATO country MAICL argued that the civilian deaths caused were clearly disproportionate to the military benefits in response to NATOs justification of actions

Electronic performance support systems
An electronic performance support system EPSS is any computer software program or component that improves user performance

EPSSs can help an organization to reduce the cost of training staff while increasing productivity and performance They can empower employees to perform tasks with a minimum amount of external intervention or training By using this type of system an employee especially a new employee will often not only be able to complete his or her work more quickly and accurately but as a secondary benefit will also learn more about the job and the employers business

An EPSS is best considered when
These situations often occur when new systems eg customer relationship management enterprise resource planning are introduced upgraded or consolidated and in certain call centres when agents must perform using complex systems processes or products

There are different views about the components and characteristics of EPSS For example from Barker and Banerjis 1995 point of view an EPSS has four functional levels which should be brought together


In Electronic Performance Support Systems Gloria Gery defined EPSS as
an integrated electronic environment that is available to and easily 
accessible by each employee and is structured to provide immediate individualized 
online access to the full range of information software guidance advice and 
assistance data images tools and assessment and monitoring systems to permit 
job performance with minimal support and intervention by others
Also in 1991 Barry Raybould gave a shorter definition
a computerbased system that improves worker productivity by providing onthejob access to integrated information advice and learning experiences

From a business perspective a former Nortel Networks executive William Bezanson 2002 provided a definition linked to application usability and organizational results A performance support system provides justintime just enough training information tools and help for users of a product or work environment to enable optimum performance by those users when and where needed thereby also enhancing the performance of the overall business

An EPSS must be distinguished from a traditional online help system Online help usually supports a single software application and is not necessarily focused on the entire range of job tasks which may involve multiple applications but just that specific software With online help crossreferencing is often not available and the information provided is limited and rarely combined with procedures or complex tasks Perhaps most critically online help cannot be customized to the user or the job task in fact the same software screen may require different inputs depending on the user and job task Online help is also not contextual to the users current situation and requires users to search through for the solution to their problem 

EPSS must also be differentiated from elearning simulations that replay a series of steps ondemand within a software application Simulations are more closely associated with ondemand training not justintime support because of the longer time considerations complexity and media restrictions for playing a simulation An EPSS can be considered a part of the elearning category as it is ondemand learning and notes that the EPSS modality fits more within the informal learning definition

In his book Bezanson points out that knowledge management is the noun corresponding to the verb of performance support The knowledge documented in the system plays a critical role in any EPSS system This concept was originated by Raybould 1997 who separates out the repository delivery and infrastructure aspects of the EPSS from the knowledge base it contains In fact Bezanson emphasizes the advantage that an LMS learning management system will interface with the EPSS to supply the knowledge base contentcourseware or other tracking capabilities that an EPSS may require if the LMS precedes the implementation of the EPSS

EPSSs role in the future of training and work have been noted by followers of the trend towards more informal learning systems driven by knowledge management systems
Tony ODriscoll 1999 summarizes 

To this day analysts such as Forresters Claire Schooley and Bersin  Associates Chris Howard write similarly themed articles based on their research in informal learning technology and training

The Miracle play
The Miracle  is a 1911 play written by Karl Vollmller and directed by Max Reinhardt from which three movie versions were later adapted The play first appeared as a spectaclepantomime in Germany in 1911

The play opened in London in 1912 and was revived on Broadway in 1924 after a tour of Detroit Milwaukee and Dallas The New York version which opened January 16 1924 at the Century Theatre was produced by Morris Gest and starred Rosamond Pinchot as the Nun and Lady Diana Cooper and Maria Carmi alternating nightly in the role of the Madonna

The Miracle retold an old legend about a nun in the Middle Ages who runs away from her convent with a knight and subsequently has several mystical adventures eventually leading to her being accused of witchcraft During her absence the statue of the Virgin Mary in the convents chapel comes to life and takes the nuns place in the convent until her safe return The play launched the career of Maria Carmi who went on to star in 25 silent films

The play has its origins in a 12thcentury legend which Spanish writer Jos Zorrilla y Moral turned into a dramatic poem entitled Margarita La Tornera Margarita the Gatekeeper The poem differs from The Miracle in resetting the story in 19thcentury Spain as the 1959 film would do and in not letting the reader know that the statue has taken the nuns place in the convent until nearly the very end Zorrillas poem was made 1909 into an opera Margarita la tornera by Spanish zarzuela composer Ruperto Chap It was his last work before his death The poem was also loosely adapted into a Spanish film Milagro de amor in 1946

The play was adapted into film three times The original authorized version was a British financed fulllength handcolored blackandwhite film The Miracle filmed in Austria in 1912 In the same year an unauthorized German version was filmed titled Das Mirakel In 1959 the play was adapted to film a third time by Warner Brothers again titled The Miracle directed by Irving Rapper

TI cuneiform
Cuneiform TI or TL Borger 2003 nr  U122FE  has the main meaning of life when used ideographically The written sign developed from the drawing of an arrow since the words meaning arrow and life were pronounced similarly in the Sumerian language

With the determinative UZU  flesh meat TI it means rib This homophony is exploited in the myth of Ninti  NINTI lady of life or lady of the rib created by Ninhursag to cure the ailing Enki Since Eve is called mother of life in Genesis together with her being taken from Adams tsela side rib the story of Adam and Eve has sometimes been considered to derive from that of Ninti

In Akkadian orthography the sign has the syllabic values di or i in Hittite ti di or te

The twelve tablet IXII Epic of Gilgamesh uses the ti sign as follows Parpola ti 387 times and TI the sumerogram 2 times In the Epic sumerogram TI is used for the Akkadian language word balu for life to live as TILA in one location Tablet XI 174 and replacement in two locations also as TILA in Tablets X and XI
For the mid 14th century BC Amarna letters letter EA 365 authored by Biridiya harvesting in Nuribta ti is used for ti and i For example on the reverse of EA 365 subject of corvee labor harvesting lines 17 and 18 translate as follows

Starr Mill
Two 19th century factory buildings are sited on a bank beside Starr Mill pond on Beverly Heights just off Middlefield Street Each building is 3 stories tall and overlooks a picturesque pond and woods to the west a parking lot packed with trucks and industrial equipment on the south and nineteenth century housing on Beverly Heights to the north

Nathan Starr Sr a scythe manufacturer purchased land on the West no Coginchaug River in Staddle Hill in 1799 Joined by his son Nathan Jr in 1812 Starr began the first of a long series of government contracts to produce swords pistols and eventually rifles They constructed a factory here in 1812 which is probably the easternmost building sited by the pond After Nathan Srs death in 1821 his son carried on the business until 1845 During this period some 70000 arms of varied kinds were made here as well as a number of commemorative swords for national heroes such as Andrew Jackson

From 1845 to 1864 the factory was relatively inactive In the latter year the Russell Manufacturing Company bought the property in 1865 they erected the building immediately to the west of the original plant in a similar height scale material and style This was an auxiliary operation complementing the main South Farms factories Russell conducted manufacturing here for some ninety years A plumbing products firm and then a lighting fixture company ran shortlived manufacturing operations here the facilities were vacant in the late 1960s Joseph J Vinci bought the property in 1971 Several small businesses currently operate here including a cabinetmaker garment shop and welding outfit

The Starr Mill is an archetypical nineteenth century mill a tall manywindowed brick building beside a mill pond There have been few major exterior alterations Roundedarched brownstone sluiceways now bricked up run beneath the building On each end of the building three gable end chimney stacks terminate in the attic Artifacts from former functions of the mill abound A late 19th century turbine lines in the water near the southeastern corner of the earlier building

This complex is a wellpreserved and significant industrial site which has been successfully adapted to light manufacturing uses The buildings are presently used for mixed use of retail office artist studios professional service space and storage The structures are well maintained

Remington Model 241
The Remington Arms Model 241 Speedmaster an autoloading rimfire rifle was manufactured from 1935 to 1951 from a John Browning design Remington reports that 107345 rifles were manufactured in 22 Short or 22 Long Rifle A similar rifle is currently being sold by Browning Arms Company the Browning SA22 Browning 22 SemiAuto rifle

The Remington Model 241 and indeed all the semiautomatic 22 rifles based on John Brownings design is a takedown design in which the barrel can be easily separated from the receiver to shorten the rifles length for ease in transporting

When Remington brought out the Model 241 in 1935 it replaced the Model 24 which although of slightly smaller size and having a few other differences was also based on John Brownings semiautomatic 22 rifle design

The Remington Model 241 is very similar to the Browning SA22 with the significant difference being the way in which the barrels are adjusted so that they fit snuggly against the receivers when the rifles are fully assembled This barrel tightening feature is made necessary due to their takedown designs a means must be provided so that the barrel is sufficiently tight when coupled to the receiver and yet not so tight as to make disengaging the barrel from the receiver overly difficult

Whereas the Browning SA22s barrel tightening is accomplished with an adjusting ring at the base of the barrel and can easily be seen where it butts up against the receiver  the Remington Model 241s barrel tightening mechanism uses a dualsided nut with an interruptedscrew thread in the interior and a full thread cut into the exterior riding inside the threaded hole in the front of the receiver only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver Selecting how deeply the dualsided nut sits in the receiver with the dualsided nuts exterior thread meshing with the thread cut into the hole in the front of the receiver controls how tightly the barrel fits against the receiver when it is attached the rifle is assembled

Persons wishing to make adjustments to the Model 241s barrel tightening mechanism must become familiar not only with the use of the dualsided nut that fits in the hole in the front of the receiver but also how that nut is locked inplace so that it will not accidentally turn once it has been set as desired What appears to be a flat blade screw head on the right side of the Model 241s receiver that can easily be mistaken as a screw to lock the dualsided nut in place is actually a cosmetic affectation on what has sometimes been described as a slug instead of having threads on its sides as would a screw it has smooth sides While the slug does indeed press inside the receiver against the outside of the dualsided nut and thus keeps the dualsided nut from rotating it does not have its pressure against the outside of the dualsided nut adjusted by rotating as it would were it a screw but instead the slug is held pressing against the outside of the dualsided nut by first being simply pushed against the outside of the dualsided nut by pressing down on the slugs flat blade screw head appearance on the right side of the receiver and then a screw the actual lockingscrew presses against the side of the slug inside the receiver and thus prevents it from moving That lockingscrew is oriented such that it comes in to press against the side of the slug from the direction of the front face of the receiver and so is only visible when the barrel is separated from the receiver

To adjust the Model 241s barrel tightness it is necessary to first loosen the dualsided nut so that it can rotate and thus have its depth within the receiver changed To loosen the dualsided nut requires that the slug pressing against it be loosened and to accomplish that the lockingscrew accessible from the face of the receiver when the barrel is removed must be backedout so that it isnt pressing against the slug The slug is then jiggled by a gentle rocking action on the false screw head of the exterior appearance of the slug  no attempt should be made to rotate the slug as if it were a screw as it has a machined appearance meshing with the outer threads of the dualsided nut and that will be sufficient so that the slug disengages within the receiver from the outside of the dualsided nut so the dualsided nut is then free to be adjusted The Model 241s elegant barrel tightening mechanism can be damaged if these steps are not followed

MarkusYamabe conjecture
In mathematics the MarkusYamabe conjecture is a conjecture on global asymptotic stability The conjecture states that if a continuously differentiable map on an formula1dimensional real vector space has a fixed point and its Jacobian matrix is everywhere Hurwitz then the fixed point is globally stable

The conjecture is true for the twodimensional case However counterexamples have been constructed in higher dimensions Hence in the twodimensional case only it can also be referred to as the MarkusYamabe theorem

Related mathematical results concerning global asymptotic stability which are applicable in dimensions higher than two include various autonomous convergence theorems Analog of the conjecture for nonlinear control system with scalar nonlinearity is known as Kalmans conjecture

The conjecture is true for formula9 and false in general for formula10

Nicocles Salamis
Nicocles  Nikokls was an Ancient Greek Cyprus king of Salamis Cyprus In 3743 BC he succeeded his presumed father Evagoras I Nicocles continued the philhellenic politics of his father Nicocles died probably together with Straton of Sidon during the revolt of satraps 362 to 360 BC v Chr He was followed as the Cypriot king of Salamis by his son Evagoras II

Some authors have proposed that Nicocles had participated in the conspiracy to which his father Evagoras fell a victim But there is no authority for this supposition Rather this idea seems to have arisen as a means of explaining the strange error made by Diodorus in considering Nicocles as the eunuch who assassinated Evagoras

Little is known of the reign of Nicocles but it appears to have been one of peace and prosperity Based on statements of his panegyrist Isocrates who addressed two of his orations to him and has made him the subject of another under his rule his kingdom flourished he replenished the treasury which had been exhausted by his fathers wars without oppressing his subjects with exorbitant taxes and behaved in all respects as the model of a mild and equitable ruler Isocrates also extols him also for his interest in literature and philosophy and provides proof of this by noting that Nicocles rewarding Isocrates for his panegyric with the magnificent present of twenty talents Vit X Orat p838 a The orator also praises him for the purity of his domestic relations although Theopompus and Anaximenes of Lampsacus ap Athen xii p531 state that he was a person of luxurious habits who had vied with Straton king of Sidon in the splendour and refinement of his feasts and other sensual indulgences Theopompus and Anaximenes of Lampsacus also state that Nicocles ultimately perished as the result of a violent death but neither the date nor the circumstances surrounding this event are recorded

Paul Osborn
Paul Osborn September 4 1901  May 12 1988 was an American playwright and screenwriter Osborns notable original plays are The Vinegar Tree Oliver Oliver and Mornings at Seven and among his several successful adaptations On Borrowed Time has proved particularly popular Counted among his bestknown screenplays would be the adaptation of John Steinbecks East of Eden and Wild River for his friend Elia Kazan South Pacific and Sayonara directed by Joshua Logan as well as Madame Curie The Yearling and Portrait of Jennie

Born in Evansville Indiana he grew up in Michigan where his father was a Baptist minister He went on to graduate from the University of Michigan At the university he formed a lasting friendship with PoetinResidence Robert Frost and earned a BA in English and an MA in psychology Following a brief stint as a student of George Pierce Baker the noted teacher of dramatic form and founder of the Yale School of Drama at Yale University he made his debut on Broadway in 1928 with the play Hotbed His next play A Ledge was produced the following season

In 1930 Osborn found singular success on Broadway with a comedy titled The Vinegar Tree that starred Mary Boland He contributed the comedy Oliver Oliver to the 1934 Broadway season and in 1984 that play won critical acclaim at the Long Wharf Theater and the Philadelphia Drama Guild with Boyd Gaines in the title role On the opening night in New Haven the audience gave Oliver Oliver a standing ovation and Osborn who suffered macular degeneration quipped I thought they were standing to get their coats

Although often noted for his adaptations Osborns 1939 comedy Mornings at Seven became one of Osborns most enduring original works It was revived on Broadway in 1980 directed by Vivian Matalon with an outstanding cast Teresa Wright Maureen OSullivan Nancy Marchand and Elizabeth Wilson It was hailed by Harold Clurman as one of the best American comedies Mornings at Seven has been presented several times on television including a version directed by Matalon but was never filmed for the big screen In 2002 the Lincoln Center Theater mounted a wellreceived production with Elizabeth Franz Frances Sternhagen Piper Laurie and Estelle Parsons as the four sisters The play received numerous nominations for awards as did the acting ensemble with Elizabeth Franz cited in particular

Osborns dramatization of On Borrowed Time has had three productions on Broadway Joshua Logan directed the premiere in 1938 with Dudley Digges Frank Conroy and Dorothy Stickney leading the cast The 1953 revival featured Victor Moore Leo G Carroll and Beulah Bondi and in 1991 George C Scott directed himself Nathan Lane and Teresa Wright in the play The 1939 MGM movie of On Borrowed Time stars Lionel Barrymore Cedric Hardwicke and Bobs Watson and Beulah Bondi Osborns rich contribution to the American theater includes the adaptations A Bell for Adano 1944 Point of No Return The World of Susie Wong The Innocent Voyage and an original verse play based on Greek myths Maiden Voyage

Paul Osborn had a gift for friendship Al Hirchfeld Elia Kazan Robert Frost Frost while becoming Americas most noted poet remained a close friend intrigued by theater and travelling to New York for Osborns first nights Frost hoped to write a play in collaboration with his former student

Tomorrows Monday a somewhat autobiographical play was written in 193536 It was first produced at the Brattleboro Theatre in Vermont in the summer of 1936 and had its New York premiere fifty years later at the Circle Repertory Company in the fall of 1985 According to Kent Paul who directed that production Al Hirschfeld the New York Times theater artist remarked to his friend Osborn I like Tomorrows Monday even more than Mornings at Seven

Elia Kazan in his autobiography A Life credits Osborn with guiding him to the section of the novel East of Eden to film as well as discovering James Dean for the film In his documentary A Letter to Elia Martin Scorsese argues that the little known Wild River which stars Montgomery Clift Lee Remick and Jo Van Fleet is among Kazans finest achievements Osborns screenplay for Wild River is an outstanding literary achievement providing scope for Kazans directorial imagination

Zafar Younis
Zafar Younis 19772007 is a fictional character in the popular BBC espionage drama Spooks known in the United States as MI5 The show follows the exploits of MI5s counterterrorism group Section D The character is played by British actor Raza Jaffrey Zafar usually called Zaf is introduced in the last episode of series 3 and he appears throughout series 4 and 5 The character is last seen in the first episode of series 6

The BBCs Spooks website depicts Zaf as a loyal team member devoted to his job and the protection of the UK He has a quick wit sometimes bordering on facetiousness He enjoys being in the field rather than behind a desk and he excels in undercover work but he can be foolhardy and his risk assessment is sometimes weak He gets along well with section chief Adam Carter whom he hero worships

To quote Raza Jaffrey Zaf is very good at his job    Hes hugely ambitious but knows how much of a sacrifice a career with the intelligence service is    He trusts Adam implicitly and the two have a great rapport He doesnt always agree with Adam but he would lay down his life for him just as he would for any of the team The BBC Press Pack for series 4 attributes to Zaf a Muslim background but notes that he is not particularly devout He is however said to be sensitive to indications that either he or his culture is being patronised or misrepresented and he despises those who use their religion as an excuse for special pleading or facile rhetoric

In the episode in which Zaf is introduced The Suffering of Strangers MI5 officers Fiona Carter and Danny Hunter are being held hostage by terrorists Zaf is an MI6 officer who had worked with Adam Carter played by Rupert PenryJones before Adam transferred to MI5 Zaf assists in saving Fionas life but Danny is killed by the terrorists With Dannys death Adam asks Zaf to join Section D

Midway through series 4 the show gains another new character the recruit Jo Portman played by Miranda Raison There is promise of a growing relationship between Jo and Zaf but this is never fully developed

At the start of series 6 Zaf is kidnapped by a band of mercenaries and his colleagues are left uncertain of his ultimate fate It is not until episode 10 that they learn that he was tortured for a paying client then sold to terrorists in Pakistan subjected to further torture and killed

After leaving the series Raza Jaffrey became a member of the cast of the BBC drama Mistresses playing Hari Dhillon husband of one of the four female leads The actor has commented Whats been really good about the roles of Zafar and Hari is that their story lines were nothing to do with their race

John Lewis referee
John Lewis 30 March 1855  13 January 1926 was an English football player administrator and referee He was born at Market Drayton Shropshire but lived most of his life in Lancashire and was primarily associated with Blackburn Rovers FC He was a leading referee from the earliest days of organised football and when well into his 60s officiated in the Gold medal match of the 1920 Olympic Games football tournament in Antwerp

On 21 April 2008 it was announced that his grave at Blackburn Municipal Cemetery had been restored to its former glory the costs having been met by Blackburn Rovers

Lewis was educated at Shrewsbury School where he began to play football He was a strict teetotaller worked alongside Old Salopian Arthur Constantine in bringing about the formation of Blackburn Rovers FC in 1875 and actually played in the first side fielded by the club He also contributed to the foundation of the Lancashire FA in 1878 and later became a vicepresident of the Football Association and the Football League

Lewis had established himself as a notable referee within the domestic game in England and earned the nickname Prince of Referees He was three times appointed the referee in the FA Cup Final 1895 1897 and 1898

He refereed the 1898 FA Cup Semifinals between Southampton and Nottingham Forest the first match ended in a 11 draw The replay at Crystal Palace was played in a blizzard After a scoreless first half in which Joe Turner missed a penalty for Southampton in the second half the Saints were on top when with ten minutes left to play referee Lewis stopped the match for a time and the players left the pitch No sooner had the game restarted than the weather worsened but Lewis decided that the match should continue Southamptons goalkeeper George Clawley had his eyes choked with snow and conceded two goals in the final minutes of the game Despite Southamptons protests the FA decided that the result should stand  this was perhaps not surprising as Lewis was by then an eminent member of the FA board

He was given charge of the 1908 Olympic final at White City London between Great Britain and Denmark which passed by without incident

Lewis had already refereed the semifinal between the host nation Belgium and the Netherlands on Thursday 31 August before being appointed for the final on Saturday 2 September 1920 

That Lewis was appointed match referee may be seen to be surprising in hindsight given his age but the Belgian national newspaper LAction Nationale wrote an editorial on 4 September 1920 which read Mr Lewis refereed the game magnificently on Thursday and yet Czechoslovakia are now disqualified

As it transpired the final was played in a poor spirit with Belgium leading 20 in the 40th minute courtesy of a Robert Coppee penalty in the 6th minute and a Henri Larnoe goal in the 30th minute that was disputed but allowed to stand Karel Peek the Czechoslovakia and Sparta Prague captain pulled his team from the field in protest after Lewis had ejected Czech leftback Karel Steiner for assaulting Coppee 15 minutes later after Lewis had awarded the match and the gold medal to Belgium the home crowd led by Belgian soldiers invaded the field

The Czech delegation made the following statement in regard to their protest 2 The majority of the decisions of the referee Mr Lewis were distorted and it was obvious that it gave the public the wrong impression in regard to our game Also both Belgian goals were the result of incorrect decisions of the referee and we seek a rigorous investigation on that point They had also complained about the inclusion and performance of an English linesman Charles WrefordBrown and the provocative influence of the troops lining the field

The Czech protest was dismissed and their team was disqualified As a consequence the tournament for the bronze medal was changed to one for the silver and bronze medals

Belz Great Synagogue
The Belz Great Synagogue  Belz Beis HaMedrash HaGadol is the largest synagogue in Israel It was built by the Belz Hasidic community with financial help from its supporters and admirers around the world

In the 1980s Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach the fifth Belzer Rebbe spearheaded plans for the huge synagogue to be erected in the Kiryat Belz neighborhood of Jerusalem The building designed with four entrances accessible to each of the four streets of the hilltop neighborhood would be an enlarged replica of the structure that the first Belzer Rebbe the Sar Shalom built in the town of Belz in 1843 It would include a grandiose main sanctuary smaller study halls wedding and bar mitzvah halls libraries and other communal facilities

Funds for the ambitious multimilliondollar project were raised among Belzer Hasidim and were supplemented by various fundraising projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s
Like the original synagogue which took 15 years to complete the new Belz synagogue that now dominates the northern Jerusalem skyline also took 15 years to construct It was dedicated in 2000

Its main sanctuary seats 10000 worshippers The ornate wooden ark an item for the Guinness Book of Records is 12 meters high and weighs 18 tons It has the capacity to hold 70 Torah scrolls Nine chandeliers each standing at high and wide each contain over 200000 pieces of Czech crystal

In stark contrast to the majestic synagogue the simple wooden chair and shtender used by Rabbi Aharon Rokeach when he came to Israel in 1944 stand in a glass case next to the ark

The main sanctuary is used only on Shabbat and Jewish holidays while weekday services take place in the underlying smaller rooms of the complex Under the main sanctuary are multiple floors The floor directly under the main sanctuary hosts a large number of small synagogue rooms known as shtieblach where services for  and Maariv are held up to every 10 minutes In an adjacent wing is also a large hall used for tishen Below the shtieblach are multiple floors with dormitorystyle sleeping quarters for Belzer Hasidim from outside of Israel who come to be with the Rebbe for Jewish holidays such as Rosh HaShana Yom Kippur and Sukkot There are also large rooms for other functions such as Seudah Shlishit on Shabbat afternoons weddings and bar mitzvah celebrations

A separate twostory house for the Belzer Rebbe stands adjacent to the synagogue Here the Rebbe maintains his office and receives guests as well as resides with his family The secondfloor balcony of the house faces the large outdoor courtyard of the synagogue where Hasidim gather for outdoor addresses by the Rebbe and for large celebrations under a giant tent such as the bar mitzvah banquets for the Rebbes grandsons in 2008 and 2010

The Belz Great Synagogue is in Kiryat Belz neighborhood 7 Binat Yisashar St 5 Jerusalem

Hapki yusul
Hapkiyusul  is a Korean martial art derived from Japanese Daitry Aikijjutsu as it was brought to Korea by Choi Yong Sul

Choi Yong Sul  is often seen as the source of Korean hapkido After Choi returned to Korea in 1946 he started teaching a martial art he had learned in Japan Daito Ryu Aikijujitsu His initial students and their students etc adapted these techniques to their own needs and added techniques from other Korean and nonKorean styles forming Hapkido Kuksool Won Hwarangdo Tukgongmoosul Hanmudo Hanpul etc

Kim Yun Sang aka Kim YoonSang  began using the term Hapkiyusul in 1987 a year after Choi Yong Sul died in order to differentiate what he had learned from Choi YongSul and was teaching from mainstream Hapkido Kim was authorized by Choi Yong Sul to use Chois own name Yong Sul as the name of his kwan Yong Sul Kwan  Hapkiyusul members practice the original techniques and learningteaching process as taught to Kim Yun Sang by Choi Chois students were told that all of these techniques including the kicks and hand strikes taught by Choi were Daito Ryu Aikijujitsu The use of hapki better known as aiki in Japanese traditions is greatly emphasized

Outside of Korea there are a few dedicated people who actively train in Hapkiyusul At the moment there at least 30 nonKoreans who hold a black belt in Hapkiyusul Schools or practice groups exist in the US Texas Australia Brazil England Germany Italy and the Netherlands

Kim Yun Sang holds seminars in Australia at least every other year and visited several European countries in February 2008 teaching seminars in Germany England and Italy

Marshal Gaspard de Tavannes superior in cavalry crossed the Charente by the bridge at Chteauneuf and was successful in defeating the Huguenots due to his execution of surprise attacks coming unexpectedly from the south The Huguenots made a last stand at Triac and were ultimately defeated with both their leaders captured in the fray and murdered in the aftermath Under the leadership of Gaspard de Coligny however a significant portion of the Huguenot army managed to escape

Minor participants on the Huguenot side were the English volunteer Walter Raleigh and Louis of Nassau

AMC straight4 engine
The American Motors Corporation straight4 engine was used by a number of AMC Jeep and Dodge vehicles from 1984 to 2002

American Motors devoted three years to the development of a new fourcylinder engine The brand new engine was designed to use AMCs existing spacing between the cylinder bores so that the tooling remained the same The location of other major components such as the distributor oil filter and starter were also kept the same so as to use the machine tools for the AMC straight6 engine

According to Jeeps chief engineer Roy Lunn unlike most engines available today it was not designed for passenger cars and then adapted for trucks We specifically developed it with our Jeep vehicles and Eagle in mind Thats the reason that performance and durability were of such prime consideration from the very beginning Although some of components were interchangeable between the AMC sixcylinder and the new engine the fourcylinder was not a cut down version of the big six Noted Roy Lunn There are some common parts but the 4cylinder includes many unique items such as its own electronics systems It also has a shorter stroke and larger bore The valves are larger and the pistons are new Roy Lunn recalled We wanted as much displacement  for power and torque  as possible within the confines of bore centers of the tooling The only parameter we could influence substantially was stroke So we picked the largest bore and stroke in order to get 25 Liters

The AMC engine has a bore x stroke of  The head features a combustion chamber and port design that was later used on the 40L  the 25L I4 head lost two cylinders in its center opposed to the sixcylinder engines The 25 engine also features five main bearings and eight overhead valves

Instead of the standard AMC bell housing bolt pattern AMCJeep engineers adopted the General Motors small V6 and fourcylinder bolt pattern commonly used with GMs transversemounted powerplants for their new engine because the new AMC 25 replaced the fourcylinder engines that had been purchased from GM and because AMC continued to buy the 28 L V6 from GM until the 40L I6 was introduced in 1987 The fourcylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 40L The 25L also shared an 18mm threaded oil filter used with the GM 28L ACDelco PF47 or equivalent to 1986 when the 40L was phased into production with the XJ the oil filter was changed over to a 20mm thread size shared with Renaults until 1991 

The AMC I4 first appeared in 1984 model year with the new XJ Cherokee In 1986 the head went under a minor revision the head bolts were increased from 716 to 12 inch From 1997 to 2002 it was marketed as the PowerTech I4 It was produced through 2002 for the Jeep Wrangler as well as for the Dodge Dakota pickup that also featured the AMCJeep designed fourcylinder as its standard engine from 1996 through 2002

This lightweight engine is similar to its big brother 40L and although not powerful it is durable with no reliability issues

Output the final year was at 5400rpm and of torque at 3250rpm using sequential multipleport fuel injection MPFI For comparison the 258 I6 provided at 3200rpm and of torque at 2000rpm in its final year with the computercontrolled carburetor

For several years the engine was detuned for the Wrangler from at least 19921995 it produced and of torque with 921 compression ratio in the Cherokee and Comanche

Note that the TBI system was made by Renix and used from mid1986August 1990

The AMC engine was used in the following vehicles

Originally designed for use on beaches and marshes for erosion and flood control the HESCO MIL quickly became a popular security device in the 1990s HESCO barriers continue to be used for their original purpose They were used in 2005 to reinforce levees around New Orleans in the few days between Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita During the June 2008 Midwest floods of HESCO barrier wall were shipped to Iowa In late March 2009 of HESCO barrier were delivered to Fargo North Dakota to protect against floods In late September 2016 10 miles of HESCO barriers were used in Cedar Rapids Iowa for the fall flood of 2016

Specifically the brand name for the barrier is Concertainer a portmanteau of concertina and container with HESCO Bastion being the company that produces it

The HESCO MIL was originally developed by Jimi Heselden a British entrepreneur and excoal miner who founded HESCO Bastion Ltd in 1989 to manufacture his invention

Assembling the HESCO MIL units entails unfolding it and filling it with sand soil or gravel usually using a front end loader The placement of the barrier is generally very similar to the placement of a sandbag barrier or earth berm except that room must generally be allowed for the equipment used to fill the barrier The main advantage of HESCO barriers strongly contributing to their popularity with troops and flood fighters is the quick and easy setup Previously people had to fill sandbags a slow undertaking with one worker filling about 20 sandbags per hour Workers using HESCO barriers and a front end loader can do ten times the work of those using sandbags

The HESCO barriers come in a variety of sizes Most of the barriers can also be stacked and they are shipped collapsed in compact sets Example dimensions of typical configurations are to 

A new system of HESCO MIL Concertainer developed specially for military use is deployed from a container which is dragged along the line of ground where the barrier is to be formed unfolding up to several hundred metres of barrier ready for filling within minutes

Trevor N Dupuy
Trevor Nevitt Dupuy May 3 1916  June 5 1995 was a colonel in the United States Army and a noted military historian

Born in Staten Island New York the son of accomplished illustrator and artist Laura Nevitt Dupuy and noted military historian R Ernest Dupuy Trevor Dupuy followed in his fathers footsteps

Trevor Dupuy attended West Point graduating in the class of 1938 During World War II he commanded a US Army artillery battalion a Chinese artillery group and an artillery detachment from the British 36th Infantry Division He was always proud of the fact that he had more combat time in Burma than any other American and received decorations for service or valour from the US British and Chinese governments After the war Dupuy served in the United States Department of Defense Operations Division from 1945 to 1947 and as military assistant to the Under Secretary of the Army from 1947 to 1948 He was a member of the original Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe SHAPE staff in Paris under Generals Dwight D Eisenhower and Matthew Ridgway from 1950 to 1952

It is as a military historian and a theorist that Trevor Dupuy would make a lasting mark on the world He is perhaps best known for his massive book The Encyclopedia Of Military History cowritten like many of his books with his father R Ernest Dupuy Starting from the beginning of history and going up the present day the book tries to cover all the major and minor military conflicts in world history Usually each entry arranged chronologically and by region gives little more than the names of the commanders and often very rough estimates for the size of the forces involved in the campaigns Dupuy was not afraid of expressing an opinion and he classified some of his subjects as Great Captains such as Alexander the Great Hannibal Julius Caesar Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden Frederick II of Prussia and Napoleon The book focuses mainly on the American and Western European experiences but offers some coverage of other regions of the world The Encyclopedia Of Military History has been revised and updated several times most recently in 1993 It can be found in the reference section of most American libraries

After Dupuy left active service in the Army in 1952 Harvard University appointed him as a Professor of Military Science and Tactics where he helped found the Harvard Defense Studies Program directed from 1958 to 1971 by Henry Kissinger He left Harvard in 1956 to become director of the program in military studies at The Ohio State University After retiring from active military duty in 1958 he served as a visiting professor in the International Relations Program at Rangoon University now Yangon University in Burma From 1960 to 1962 Dupuy worked for the Institute for Defense Analyses a governmentfunded think tank

In 1962 he formed the first of his research companies dedicated to the study and analysis of armed conflict the Historical Evaluation and Research Organization HERO and served as President and Executive Director until 1983 From 1967 to 1983 he was also President of T N Dupuy Associates Inc TNDA which became the parent organization for HERO In 1983 TNDA sold its assets including HERO to a new corporation he formed called Data Memory Systems Inc DMSI Trevor was the president and largest stockholder in DMSI In 1990 Dupuy resigned from DMSI sold his stock and reactivated TNDA In 1992 TNDA was closed out and he established the nonprofit The Dupuy Institute TDI

Dupuys main contribution to military operation analysis is the assessment method Quantified Judgment Method or QJM where the outcome of a battle is predicted using a fairly complicated multiplicativeadditive formula in which various factors relating to the strength and firepower of the fighting parties as well as the circumstances are taken into account Dupuy and his associates adjusted the parameters of his model by using known statistical facts of several recorded battles

Dupuy committed suicide by gunshot at his home in Vienna Virginia on June 5 1995 he had learned three weeks earlier that he had terminal pancreatic cancer He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery During his lifetime he wrote or cowrote more than 50 books

When he died he had been married five times He fathered nine children  six boys and three girls

The second version of the video is the most wellknown and received heavy rotation airplay at MTV It is a magical fantasy concept video set in the 1940s the heyday of dance halls The video begins in black and white with Jack Hues stopping in front of a closeddown hall setting down the suitcase he carries and picking up a flyer The scene shifts to colour featuring the band performing in the packed hall with the backing of a big band as couples dance played by heavily madeup children from a local dancing school Later a disco ball descends to the floor and breaks open allowing a mirrorcovered dancer to emerge The video ends in black and white with Hues walking past the hall and down the street he leaves his suitcase behind but it sprouts legs and hurries off after him

This version was nominated for Best New Artist at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards losing to Sweet Dreams Are Made of This by Eurythmics

Edict of Boulogne
The Edict of Boulogne also called the Edict of Pacification of Boulogne and the Peace of La Rochelle was signed in July 1573 by King Charles IX of France in the Chteau de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne It was officially registered by the Parlement of Paris on 11 August 1573 The treaty officially ended the fourth phase of the French Wars of Religion set off by the St Bartholomews Day massacre in August 1572 this phase of the wars included the siege of La Rochelle 15721573 and the Siege of Sancerre

The treaty severely curtailed many of the rights granted to the French Protestants in the previous Peace of SaintGermainenLaye Based on the terms of the treaty all Huguenots were granted amnesty for their past actions and the freedom of belief However they were permitted the freedom to worship only within the three towns of La Rochelle Montauban and Nmes and there only privately within their own residences Protestant nobles with the right of highjustice were permitted to celebrate marriages and baptisms but only before an assembly limited to ten persons outside of their family Outside of the three mentioned cities Protestantism worship was forbidden completely
Due to pressure from the Catholic League Henry III of France had to cancel the Peace of La Rochelle recriminalizing Protestantism and beginning a new chapter in the French Wars of Religion which did not conclude until Henry IV issued the Edict of Nantes in 1598

Karigane joined the Nihon Kiin when it was founded in 1926 but shortly afterwards broke away to form the Kiseisha splinter group Rivalry would persist between the two groups until 1991 when the Keiinsha the eventual offshoot of the Kiseisha was finally dissolved with the death of its last member During the first quarter of the twentieth century Karigane was one of the two strongest Japanese players and his major opponent was Honinbo Shusai of the Nihon Kiin The two rivals each backed by distinct organisations finally agreed to play one another in what would become a famous and much anthologised game lasting sixteen hours

Karigane who was a 7 dan at the time played as black Shusai the only 9 dan at the time took white and won on time The marked stone representing move 211 was played shortly before Karigane conceded Edward Lasker in his book Go and Go Moku wrote

This game was also replayed in Hikaru no Go Season 1 Episode 4 up to a point where Hikaru Shindo failed to heed Fujiwara no Sais advice and deviated from Kariganes play and lost the group much earlier to arrogant Shogi captain Kaga But then Fujiwara managed to keep the loss down to a mere 12 point after komi

Karigane was promoted to 8 dan in 1933 and founded the Keiinsha as a replacement for the Kiseisha in 1941 Later that year he played against Go Seigen one of the strongest emerging Go players as part of a jubango a series of ten games during which players alternate colours though when losing the opponent is typically forced to take black Of these matches only five were played Seigen having won four before the jubango was cancelled to avoid further embarrassment for Karigane

On 1 January 1959 the Keiinsha promoted Karigane to 9 dan He died shortly after on 21 February

Walpole Island New Caledonia
Walpole Island French le de Walpole is a small and uninhabited French island east of New Caledonia in the South Pacific Although it is geographically part of the Loyalty Islands administratively it belongs to the Isle of Pines municipality of New Caledonia

There is evidence that the island had prehistoric inhabitants Graves shell and bone tools as well as stone markers indicate the presence of a permanent population at some point The island is the topic of several oral traditions from Mar and the Isle des Pines the two closest inhabited islands Speculation amongst the overseers of the Guano mining operation suggested that shipwreck or other castaways had also occupied the island British captain Butler discovered the island in 1794 and named it after his ship Walpole

From 1910 through 1936 guano was mined on the island and about 150000 tonnes were exported to New Zealand

The island is only visited by scientific naturalist research missions

As the easternmost island of the Loyalty Islands arc Walpole is located east of New Caledonia 168 57 E 22 36 S It is long NorthSouth and wide with an area of about 

Walpole is a coral island of volcanic origin During the last glaciation cycles the island was submerged and rose several times creating a coral capping The island is bordered by eroding cliffs On the eastern shore is a narrow plain The island has no source of surface fresh water

Tefkat
Tefkat is a Model Transformation Language and a model transformation engine The language is based on Flogic and the theory of stratified logic programs The engine is an Eclipse plugin for the Eclipse Modeling Framework EMF

Tefkat was one of the subprojects of the Pegamento project at the Distributed Systems Technology Centre DSTC Australia Although the project was already underway the most active research occurred for the submission of a response to the OMGs MOF 20 Queries  Views  Transformations Request for Proposals

Tefkat was opensourced before the closure of the DSTC in June 2006

Tefkat defines a mapping from a set of source metamodels to a set of target metamodels A Tefkat transformation consists of rules patterns and templates Rules contain a source term and a target term Patterns are simply named composite source terms and templates are simply named composite target terms These elements are based on Flogic and pure logic programming however the absence of function symbols means a significant reduction in complexity

Tefkat has two more significant language elements trackings and injections Trackings allow arbitrary relationships to be preserved in a trace model Injections allow the identity of target objects to be specified in terms of a function symbol Thus injections are similar but more powerful to QVTs keys which specify a target objects identity to be a function of its type and some of its properties

The declarative semantics of a Tefkat transformation is the perfect model of traces and targets that satisfies all the rules A more imperative semantics of a Tefkat transformation is the iterated least fixedpoint of the immediate consequence of each rule Due to stratification these semantics are equivalent and unambiguous Tefkat does not use explicit rulecalling all nonabstract rules fire independently from all others however rules can be loosely coupled using trackings injections rule extension andor rule superseding

Tefkat has an SQLlike concrete syntax designed to concisely convey the intent of each rule pattern or template

The Tefkat language is defined in terms of EMOF 20 however the engine is implemented in terms of Ecore the EMOFlike metametamodel at the centre of EMF The language is very similar to the Relations package of QVT however it is not strictly compliant

Connecticut Valley Hospital
Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown Connecticut is a public hospital operated by the state of Connecticut to treat people with mental illness It was historically known as Connecticut General Hospital for the Insane It is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985

The historic district includes late 19th and 20th century revival and late Victorian architecture When listed on the National Register the district included 27 contributing buildings Also included were 25 noncontributing buildings

The Connecticut Hospital for the Insane was formally opened in Middletown in 1868 Two years earlier Middletown had granted the site to the State for the establishment of an asylum to accommodate Connecticuts mentally ill By 1896 four groups of buildings had been erected and the institution was one of the largest of its kind in the country

The site is still used as a psychiatric care facility operated by the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services The State has indicated that it wishes to demolish up to 24 buildings on the campus

Located in the South Farms district Connecticut Valley Hospital consists of a large concentration of early and contemporary buildings The site landscaped with broad lawns and large shade trees is at the top of a hill and offers panoramic views of the city Silver Street and Bow Lane pass thorough the property which is bordered by Eastern Drive to the west Small drives leading from these streets traverse the propertys grounds

The hospital consists of approximately eighty structures complemented by south and east of the main site It includes large institutional buildings constructed of brick and brownstone frame and brick residences and a number of maintenance buildings The majority of these form a large group centered on Shew Hall This site contains approximately 200 acres It comprises many distinctive structures that evidence different periods of the institutions development

Shew Hall the original hospital structure was built in 1867 It functions as the administrative building and is the focal point of the institution This large structure is named in honor of the hospitals first superintendent Dr Abram M Shew Designed by Addison Hutton of Philadelphia it was constructed in the Second Empire style The building was remodeled in 1939 when the interior was updated and a flat roof bordered by a parapet was installed on the main section The three large wings display mansard roofs and details that are indicative of the main sections former appearance

Stanley Hall built around 1879 was also designed in the Second Empire style It was the hospitals maximum security facility in prior years Stanley Hall was dismantled and removed some time after 1999

Woodward Hall erected around 1886 is in the Queen Anne style It has an irregular profile that is accentuated by many ells The structure exhibits multiple roofs capped by numerous chimneys wide turrets and large gabled dormers The interior has been recently remodeled The Queen Anne style section of Woodward Hall was torn down in 2007 and there are tentative plans to develop a garden where it once stood The newer section of Woodward Hall built in the early 20th century at the same time Weeks Hall was built still stands and houses the geriatric wards

Weeks Hall built in 1896 was also constructed in the Queen Anne and in addition had features that suggested the influence of the Jacobethan Revival Its appearance similar to that of Woodward Hall was highlighted by prominent steeply pitched gables and floral designs in terra cotta The interior sections and roofs of the western side of Weeks Hall collapsed in the 21st century but the exterior walls remained standing until the structure burned on September 21 2010

Smith Home constructed about 1909 is designed in the Colonial Revival style It has a crossgabled roof crowned by a slender distinctive tower The main entrance displays fluted pilasters and a large fan in relief above the door Currently unoccupied the structure once housed hospital employees

Other notable early buildings are located on the grounds The police station a distinctive cottage was erected in 1895 Shepherd Home and Russell Hall are two similar structures that were built in the 1920s they exhibit large ornate porticoes which are classical in design There are also a number of small residences constructed during the late nineteenth century that have served as living quarters for the staff Smith Home and Shepard Home once provided housing for nursing staff Russell Hall once was used as the oncampus medical hospital

This site reflects the history associated with the care and treatment of the mentally ill in Connecticut The buildings reminiscent of different eras of the hospitals past document its progressive growth and comprise a diverse collection that contributes to the architectural variety of Middletown

Asteiidae
Asteiidae is a small but widespread family of acalyptrate flies or Diptera About 130 species in 10 genera have been described worldwide They are rarely collected

For terms see Morphology of Diptera

Adult asteiids are minute to small 13 millimeters thinbodied and delicate often weakly sclerotized flies with yellowblack or dark coloursThe wings are relatively long and transparent The head is rounded the male almost always with distinct interfrontal stripes The arista may be bare or pubescent but usually has a zigzag of longer and shorter alternating rays The postvertical bristles are weakly developed divergent or parallel or totally absent Ocellar bristles may be present or absent There is one orbital bristle on each side of the frons Shtakelberg 02 pairs of frontal bristles Interfrontal bristles may be present as may scattered interfrontal setulae Vibrissae may be absent or present On the mesonotum are one to two pairs of dorsoscentral bristles The costa is entire without interruptions the subcosta is reduced posterior basal wing cell and discoidal wing cell are fused anal cell of wing and anal vein of wing are absent Tibiae lack a dorsal preapical bristle

See 

Adults are often found on flowers and low vegetatation but have been collected at windows indoors and on tree wounds In one genus Leiomyza adults are found on mushrooms and bracket fungi Adults of the species Astiosoma rufifrons Duda are attracted to wood ash after bonfires especially at evening Larval biologies are unknown but adults have been reared from fungi Leiomyza stalks of Cannabis sativa flower buds and dried reed stems Sabrosky 1987 suggested that the larvae may be scavengers in the frass of other insects

<doc id="7726532" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7726532" title="Fhnlein">
Fhnlein
The Fhnlein in Swedish fnika was a military unit approximately equivalent to the company or battalion which was used in parts of Europe during the Middle Ages The size of the unit varied originally a Fhnlein could consist of as many as 1000 soldiers but numbers were generally less around 500 It was subdivided into sections or Rotten singular Rotte of between 6 and 12 men

The Fhnlein meaning small banner consisted of small number of soldiers that were organized under a single banner hence the units name Rotte comes from the Middle Latin word rupta which means dispersed troop The word company which was used throughout Europe superseded Fhnlein in the 17th century even in Germanspeaking regions It was later used by the scouts and Wandervgel as well as by the Deutsches Jungvolk during the Nazi era Rotte was later also used in the organisational structure of the SS and has survived into the Bundeswehr

By the Middle Ages the Fhnlein was already the administrative unit with military forces especially in the infantry It initially had 400 to 600 men sometimes up to 1000 In France it usually consisted of 300 men Georg von Frundsberg had 380 Landsknechte However these numbers were target strengths which were almost never attained Thus the actual strength of the French Fhnlein for a long time was no more than 100 to 200 men

The regiments of different armies had very different numbers of Fhnlein

The Fhnlein consisted of a mix of archers pikemen and halberdiers

In the 17th century some Fhnleins or fnikor would have a strength of only 100 to 200 men and it was at this time that the designation company came into widespread use

In Germany a Fhnlein was the subordinate formation within a Landsknecht regiment Each Fhnlein consisted of several Rotten singular Rotte As a formed unit a Fhnlein consisted of around 400 Landsknechte commanded by a captain Feldhauptmann Hauptmann or Kapitn

A Rotte consisted of eight to twelve Landsknechte or six Doppelsldner and was led by a Rottmeister It equates roughly to the modern section or fireteam
At the beginning of the 17th century ie before the Thirty Years War a Fhnlein in Germany was supposed to have the following strength

Under Charles V the staff of a German Fhnlein was as follows
This structure was also called the prima plana Latin for first sheet because these appointments were on the first page of the muster lists

Roughly the same organization was used in Sweden where each province raised a number of fnikor which were organized into a provincial regiment Many of the regiments of the Swedish Army of today trace their origins back to the fnikor of the 16th century The fnika was led by a Kapten the equivalent of a Captain

The military rank of Fhnrich Germany or Fnrik Sweden was held by the ensigns or low ranking officer who carried the banner German Fahne Swedish Fana of the Fhnlein or fnika The Spanish army has a similar formation called a Bandera flag banner

Edict of Amboise
The Edict of Amboise also known as the Edict of Pacification was signed at the Chteau of Amboise on 19 March 1563 by Catherine de Medici acting as regent for her son Charles IX of France The treaty officially ended the first phase of the French Wars of Religion Moreover the treaty restored peace to France by guaranteeing the Huguenots religious privileges and freedoms

Though the Edict was not as generous as the Edict of SaintGermain January 1562 it still allowed open and unregulated Protestant services in the private households of nobles and in one suburb of a predetermined town in each baillage or snchausse

The Parlement of Paris which had expelled its Huguenot members resisted registering the Edictas did the provincial parlements but capitulated after remonstrances adding the proviso that the Edict was to have limited application until the King should achieve his majority when a national council would decide the religious question When the King announced his majority 17 August 1563 shortly after his thirteenth birthday he chose the provincial Parlement of Rouen as the unprecedented site of his lit de justice and published at the same time a more comprehensive version of the Edict

The Braford is primarily used for beef but sometimes used for rodeo Brafords were developed both in Australia in 1946 and in Florida in 1947

Brafords have heat and insect resistance because of the increased number of sweat glands and oily skin inherited from their Brahman heritage They have been known to be of an ornery disposition though this may be due to their raising any predisposition toward being difficult is still a subject of debate They are often used in Rodeos due to their massive bulk and bone density hardiness heat endurance and arguably their ornery disposition They do well in warm climates though they have been raised in northern climates and seem to do well there as well likely due to their great bulk

The original Kilmory Shinty Club was founded in 1914 and had success in the 1930s After the Second World War the club reformed as Kilmory United and played until 1955 The club reformed in 1977 the players being school leavers and some more experienced players who had come to live in the Mid Argyll area This team disbanded in 1994 due to team raising difficulties The present Kilmory Camanachd Club was reformed in 1998 Kilmory have won the following major trophies since 1977 Division Two Fraser Cup in 197879 198586 198889 199192 and 199900 Bullough Cup in 1979 and 1992 After the reformation of the club in 1977 the club also formed a second team which took the name Furnace one of the most famous names in shinty

Furnace won the Camanachd Cup in 1923 without conceding a goal to any team a feat not repeated until Newtonmore in 2013 It was also an example of Furnace using early sports science to deduce that their final opponent Newtonmores stamina was due to their backgrounds as gameskeepers and shepherds Furnace started doing road running to build up their leg strength
Furnace joined with Inveraray as Lochfyneside and twice reached but lost in Camanachd Cup Finals  1949 and 1953 However Furnace had gone into abeyance many years before the resurrection of the name 
The use of the name Furnace ceased in the mid 1990s the last Kilmory reserve team playing as Kilmory The clubs second team restarted in 2008 and will compete in the Bullough Cup

The club won South Division One in 2004 but lost to Strathglass in a playoff for promotion to the National League The club struggled in the 2011 season avoiding relegation by beating Aberdour in the penultimate game of the season This was a disappointing year after a successful 2010 that saw them reach third in the league The 2018 season has been fairly good with only 2 defeats 90518 so far this season But the highlight of the season for Kilmory was beating there local rivals Inveraray 54 in a derby match at the winterton in Inveraray Kilmory are definitely a better team

Eyes of the Insane
Eyes of the Insane is a 2006 song by the American thrash metal band Slayer taken from their 2006 album Christ Illusion The lyrics explore an American soldiers mental anguish following his return home from the second Gulf War and are based on an article entitled Casualty of War in Texas Monthly magazine Eyes of the Insane was written by vocalist Tom Araya during preproduction for the album The song was generally well received by critics and also peaked 15 on the Danish singles charts

The accompanying music video by the Tehranborn Armenian director Tony Petrossian was recorded in the Los Angeles area in August 2006 The film is presented as a closeup of the soldiers pupil and iris which reflect disconcerting images of warthemed horrors flashbacks of his home wife and children and ultimately images of his death Eyes of the Insane was used on the soundtrack to Saw III and won an award for the Best Metal Performance at the 49th Grammy Awards

While walking through an airport vocalist Tom Araya picked up a March 2006 issue of Texas Monthly with a soldiers helmet on the front cover Seeing the article Casualty of War he was interested enough to purchase a copy The issue explored the involvement of military personnel from Texas in the Iraq War and included a list of Texan soldiers who had died in the conflict The feature was accompanied by photographs of some of the dead while a further article dealt with the anguish of surviving soldiers on their return home Araya later said that the article blew his mind

Araya read the article during his flight back to Los Angeles Preproduction for Slayers ninth studio album Christ Illusion had just begun and the band was about to undertake a threeday rehearsal with producer Josh Abraham Araya left his baggage at the hotel to attend the rehearsals then returned to reread the article Finding it to be very profound he woke up in the middle of the night and wrote down the lyrics He said that his treatment of the topic is sincere and that he believes it to be one that the military doesnt want you to know They sweep it under the rug but its a story that needs to be told The bands guitarist Kerry King has said that these new songs from the Christ Illusion album arent political at all Jihad Eyes of the Insane  its whats spewing out at us from the TV

Eyes of the Insane is 3 minutes 23 seconds long A slow drum pattern played by Dave Lombardo opens the track over which Hanneman and King play angular and descending scales on guitar These guitar riffs evolve from verse to verse and have been described by Allmusic as intensely harrowing The song gradually builds over the course of the verses refrain and bridge before resolving with a towering chorus

Some reviewers paid particular attention to Arayas vocal contribution Zach Hothorn of Prefix magazine said the song allows Araya to show his vocal range deepening to build up tension and creating a wonderfully chilling 3 and a half minutes while Ian Robinson of musicOMH felt the track is a distinct but welcome change of pace Dave Lombardos machinegun rhythms forming the backbone for Tom Arayas impressively intact scream

By the time Slayer decided that a music video should be filmed touring commitments prevented their involvement in the actual shoot Instead others were contacted to produce the film Director Tony Petrossian presented Slayer with the first draft and the group made a few suggestions for improvement Never having met him King recalled Petrossian had a treatment and we all dug the treatment so we just turned him loose Eyes of the Insanes warthemed music video was filmed on August 13 2006 in the Los Angeles area Casting company Tolley Casparis Casting sought a male Caucasian between the ages of 18 and 26 to appear in the clip with auditions held on August 10 2006 The official project notes deemed that This guy must be a serious actor capable of emoting everything through his eyes He was innocent a few months ago now he is scarred by seeing so much fighting Strong eyebrows that do not overpower the face Scars or large veins actually a plus
The video was shot as a firstperson narrative about the horrors leading up to the final moments of a soldier at war and was described as a single long and tight closeup of the soldiers eye with images clearly reflected within his pupil and iris and perfectly choreographed with the rhythm of the music Reflected are disconcerting images of para trooping into enemy territory gunfire helicopters and tanks explosions poignant flashbacks of his wife and child and home and the images of his death Two endings were shot one in which the soldier is killed as the result of sustained combat wounds and another in which the soldier commits suicide by hanging  the latter one was used Jeff Hanneman confirmed that the band loved the eye concept and personally felt that the video was pretty amazing when he first viewed it King admitted that the film is pretty cool  I thought it was neat idea  very different especially for us because we usually do performance based videos The video was exclusively posted on mp3com late in October 2006 In 2007 the video earned a Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards nomination for Best Video but eventually lost to Avenged Sevenfolds Seize The Day

Critics were generally positive when reviewing Eyes of the Insane Stylus magazines Cosmo Lee described the track as a dark midpaced exploration of a soldiers psyche and remarked that its memorable and would be a good breather between the usual barnburners Peter Atkinson of KNACcom felt that Eyes of the Insane offers a posttraumatic sequel to Mandatory Suicide again with a soundtrack that recalls the original but boasting a couple truly mammoth hooks that do shake things up Don Kaye of Blabbermouth made a comparison to a different Slayer track than Atkinson and commented that Eyes of the Insane and Catatonic both have that slow grinding feeling of doom that the band has done so well before on classics like Dead Skin Mask

The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards When asked for his thoughts on the nomination King revealed that he did not even care and noted that Slayer fans dont give a shit and thats the most important thing to me The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayers inflammatory lyrics to which King replied That would be the coolest thing you know To win with the shit we write about The ceremony was held on February 11 2007 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles with Slayer competing against Mastodon Lamb of God Ministry and Stone Sour Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus Ohio Jeff Hanneman and I put a lot into Eyes of the Insane so were thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it and then vote for it Were out here on the road and were all really really happy King disagreed deeming the song one of the poorest representations of us Slayer on the record Christ Illusion He further said that if given the decision he would have chosen the controversial track Jihad to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion Critical of the Recording Academy King said Realistically I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name  And thats what we are

The soundtrack to the 2006 horror film Saw III included Eyes of the Insane and was released on October 24 2006 by Warcon Enterprises The track was one of six songs performed by Slayer during their first US network television appearance on ABCTVs Jimmy Kimmel Live January 19 2007 and was the only song broadcast in its entirety
However King dislikes playing Eyes of the Insane live commenting Its just dull to play good song just dull to play on guitar

John Prince biographer
Rev John Prince 16431723 vicar of Totnes and Berry Pomeroy in Devon England was a biographer He is best known for his Worthies of Devon a series of biographies of Devonborn notables covering the period before the Norman Conquest to his own era He became the subject of a sexual scandal the court records of which were made into a book in 2001 and a play in 2005

John Prince was born in 1643 in a farmhouse now called Princes Abbey on the site of Newenham Abbey in the parish of Axminster Devon He was the eldest son of Bernard Prince died 1689 to whom John erected a monument in Axminster Church by his first wife Mary Crocker daughter of John Crocker of the ancient Crocker family seated at Lyneham House in the parish of Yealmpton Devon Lyneham was After Hele the second earliest known home of the Crocker family one of the most ancient in Devon according to the traditional rhyme quoted by Prince himself which he called that old saw often used among us in discourse
poemCrocker Cruwys and Coplestone
When the Conqueror came were at homepoem
John Prince had a family connection to his great contemporary John Churchill 1st Duke of Marlborough 16501722 Princes father Bernard Prince had married secondly as her second husband to Jane Drake a daughter of Philip Drake of Salcombe third in descent from John Drake of Axmouth father of John Drake died 1558 of Ash in the parish of Musbury Jane was thus 3rd cousin of Sir John Drake died 1636 of Ash the father of Sir John Drake 1st Baronet died 1669 whose sister was Elizabeth Drake mother of John Churchill 1st Duke of Marlborough 16501722 Sir John Drake 1st Baronet died 1669 was John Princes godfather and one of Princes Worthies was Sir Bernard Drake died 1586 of Ash son of John Drake died 1558

He was educated at Brasenose College Oxford and became curate of Bideford He then became minister of St Martins Church in Exeter He was vicar of Totnes from 1675 until 1681 when at the invitation of the Duke of Somerset he was made vicar of Berry Pomeroy a post he held for over forty years Here he seems to have authorised much building work as the church and vicarage have several period features

While at Berry Pomeroy Prince worked on his magnum opus a biography of his home countys many notable figures which he probably finished in 1697 The book ran to 600 pages with woodcuts to illustrate the 191 biographies and he struggled to get it published because most publishers able to handle such a large book were based in London or Oxbridge Funding was also a problem as a scandal see below had temporarily deprived him of his living The printer was forced to advertise for subscribers while the book languished for four years It was first published in 1701 under the title no doubt inspired by the Worthies of England 1662 by Thomas Fuller 16081661 
Danmonii Orientales Illustres or the Worthies of Devon A work wherein the lives and fortunes of the most famous divines statesmen swordsmen physicians writers and other eminent persons natives of that most noble province from before the Norman Conquest down to the present age are memorised in an alphabetical order out of the most approved authors both in print and manuscript In which an account is given not only of divers very deserving persons many of which were never hitherto made publick but of several antient and noble families their seats and habitations the distance they bear to the next great towns their coats of arms fairly cut with other things no less profitable than pleasant and delightful

The Dumnonii Danmonii or Dumnones were a British Celtic tribe which inhabited Dumnonia the peninsula now containing in its west the county of Cornwall and in its east Devon Princes Latin title signifies Illustrious Eastern Dumnonii

It is evident that Prince was overambitious in his work The alphabetical entries from A to H fill half the book while L to Z are squeezed into the final quarter as money problems took their toll on his inclusions A second volume detailing 115 entries chosen by Prince to redress the balance was never published though a manuscript exists in the Devon Record Office This manuscript was discussed and its biographies listed by J BrookingRowe in an article in the 1900 volume of the Transactions of the Devonshire Association

A further edition was published in 1810 by Edward Upham Exeter and Longman and Hurst Rees and Orme London printed for Rees and Curtis Plymouth It was inscribed to The Right Hon Hugh Earl Fortescue Viscount Ebrington and Baron Fortescue of Castle Hill LordLieutenant and Custos Rotulorum of the County of Devon whose ancestors claim a distinguished place in the work It was funded by subscription with a list of subscribers included after the list of contents

Prince married Gertrude Salter 16441725 youngest daughter of Anthony Salter a physician of Exeter by his wife Gertrude Acland a daughter of John Acland died 1641 of the parish of St Olave Exeter Mayor of Exeter in 1627 Prince included in his Worthies an uncle and a greatuncle of his wife John Acland was the 2nd son of Baldwin Acland died 1572 of Hawkridge Chittlehampton a junior branch of the later prominent Acland family which originated at Acland Landkey North Devon later seated at Killerton Gertrude Aclands eldest brother was Baldwin Acland 16071672 Treasurer of Exeter Cathedral whom Prince made one of his Worthies of Devon which biography he termed a slender monument to the memory of a good man and a worthy divine Gertrudes mother was Elizabeth Duck sister of Nicholas Duck 15701628 Recorder of Exeter whom Prince also made one of his Worthies whose biography also contained a substantial biography of her other younger brother Arthur Duck 15801649 a lawyer and MP

In 2001 Todd Gray published the court depositions of Princes church trial as The Curious Sexual Adventure of the Reverend John Prince which awakened interest in Prince It was while serving as vicar of Berry Pomeroy that a scandal occurred In April 1699 Prince arranged a meeting with a local woman Mary Southcote in the back room of an inn Their dalliance was witnessed through a broken window they were interrupted and a court case followed later that year However despite many statements against him Prince was allowed to keep his post from which he had been suspended as the main witnesses were deemed to be unreliable He returned to Berry Pomeroy and lived out his years as vicar A plaque in St Marys Church in Totnes states that he was well connected and it is possible that the trial was set up by his enemies The records of the trial were hitherto unpublished partly due to the coarse language used by some of the witnesses it was not until the modern age that such language became less shocking and could be included in a popular work In 2005 the book was adapted as a play The Tale of John Prince which was performed by the South Devon Players theatre company in 2006 at two venues relevant to the story The Seven Sisters Hotel in Totnes next door to the former site of Angels inn and also in Berry Pomeroy Church

Knutsford Academy
Knutsford Academy formerly known as Knutsford High School is a secondary school in Knutsford Cheshire England It has Specialist School Status in the areas of English and Humanities As of 2014 it also includes a Studio school site

The upper school on Bexton Rd was opened as a secondary modern school for boys and girls on 13 November 1953 The lower school on Westfield Drive was built as a separate school for girls and opened on 26 April 1966 In 1973 the two schools combined to form one comprehensive coeducational establishment known as Knutsford County High School Over 201112 work was being performed on the lower site to remove asbestos that was built into the walls

Knutsford High School became Knutsford Academy on 1 April 2012 after gaining Academy status This brought with it a complete uniform change Instead of the previous Blue polo shirt and jumper the current uniform is a plain and simple black businessstyle suit for years 910 and 11 Students are free to choose their own tie design For years 7 and 8 a Blue Blazer is worn with a stripey blue clipon tie

The school has a full traditional sixthform facility running alongside or as an alternative to the Studio

There are two main sites to the school lower and upper school The Upper Site also has the new Studio School building Between the two sites there is a public walkway known as the link path Students in years 7 to 8 are taught in the lower school building At year 9 the students begin at upper school Lower school was once known as middle school as it was considered the middle stage of education back when students were expected to find work after their final year at the school  upper school being the last stage of education The upper school building is joined to the Knutsford Leisure Centre providing sporting facilities for the PE department Outside both buildings are fields with multiple football pitches and multiple tennis courts and a threepitch astroturf pitch
As of 2014 the Upper Site features a Studio School  headed by Nicola Hall who was brought in especially for the job George Osborne member of Parliament for Tatton was there to officially start the construction of the new site The site was opened officially on 22 January 2015 by George Osborne

Knutsford Academy offers technology available for CAD Computer Aided Design Computer Graphics and physical construction design with hardware including over 100 individual Apple macs Those available to all upper students and most teachers have white mac books most running OSX Tiger or Windows XP or Notebooks These were replaced 201314 with Toshiba Laptops For students there are over two hundred general use ICT computers across both sites Most computers are able to use industrystandard software such as Adobe Creative Suite 6 or CS6 In 2014 Microsoft Office 365 was in the process of starting to replace the existing Office 2013 software The school also has laser cutters for cutting out CAD work and numerous other wood working devices

Old Middletown Post Office
The Old Middletown Post Office in Middletown Connecticut also known as the US Post Office was built in 1916 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places NRHP in 1982 The building is also on the NRHP as a contributing property of the Main Street Historic District

The building is made of limestone using a structural system of load bearing masonry It was designed by the Office of the Supervising Architect under James A Wetmore and built by W H Frissell  Co of New York City

This fine twostory example of the Renaissance Revival style is located on the south west corner of Court and Main Streets facing the Connecticut River Across Court Street to the north is the massive Liberty Bank building and to its south across a parking lot is the Bank of America building Together these three buildings give this section of the central business district a solid and classical look

In 1911 the United States Government decided to build a new post office facility in Middletown Preparations for construction began shortly thereafter The selection of the buildings location was a topic of much controversy The government finally chose this location federally owned since 1841 in the center of Middletowns commercial and financial district

Contemporary sources indicate that the new post office was a source of civic pride for the citizens of Middletown Its facade of smooth limestone distinguished it in a city center where brick and Portland brownstone were the common building materials The classical facade displays a twostory arrangement of arched windows and pilasters supporting an elaborate entablature The interior features a large two story open lobby

The old post office ceased operation in 1977 ending 136 years of federal use of that site

Liberty Bank uses this building as office space and keeps the building in good condition

<doc id="7726829" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7726829" title="Oxyfuel combustion process">
Oxyfuel combustion process
Oxyfuel combustion is the process of burning a fuel using pure oxygen instead of air as the primary oxidant Since the nitrogen component of air is not heated fuel consumption is reduced and higher flame temperatures are possible Historically the primary use of oxyfuel combustion has been in welding and cutting of metals especially steel since oxyfuel allows for higher flame temperatures than can be achieved with an airfuel flame

There is currently research being done in firing fossilfueled power plants with an oxygenenriched gas mix instead of air Almost all of the nitrogen is removed from input air yielding a stream that is approximately 95 oxygen Firing with pure oxygen would result in too high a flame temperature so the mixture is diluted by mixing with recycled flue gas or staged combustion The recycled flue gas can also be used to carry fuel into the boiler and ensure adequate convective heat transfer to all boiler areas Oxyfuel combustion produces approximately 75 less flue gas than air fueled combustion and produces exhaust consisting primarily of CO and HO see figure

The justification for using oxyfuel is to produce a CO rich flue gas ready for sequestration Oxyfuel combustion has significant advantages over traditional airfired plants Among these are


Economically speaking this method costs more than a traditional airfired plant The main problem has been separating oxygen from the air This process needs lots of energy nearly 15 of production by a coalfired power station can be consumed for this process However a new technology which is not yet practical called chemical looping combustion can be used to reduce this cost In chemical looping combustion the oxygen required to burn the coal is produced internally by oxidation and reduction reactions as opposed to using more expensive methods of generating oxygen by separating it from air

At present in the absence of any need to reduce CO emissions oxyfuel is not competitive However oxyfuel is a viable alternative to removing CO from the flue gas from a conventional airfired fossil fuel plant However an oxygen concentrator might be able to help as it simply removes nitrogen

In industries other than power generation oxyfuel combustion can be competitive due to higher sensible heat availability Oxyfuel combustion is common in various aspects of metal production

The glass industry has been converting to oxyfuel since the early 1990s because glass furnaces require a temperature of approximately 2800 degrees F which is not attainable at adiabatic flame temperatures for airfuel combustion unless heat is regenerated between the flue stream and the incoming air stream Historically glass furnace regenerators were large and expensive high temperature brick ducts filled with brick arranged in a checkerboard pattern to capture heat as flue gas exits the furnace When the flue duct is thoroughly heated air flow is reversed and the flue duct becomes the air inlet releasing its heat into the incoming air and allowing for higher furnace temperatures than can be attained with airfuel only Two sets of regenerative flue ducts allowed for the air flow to be reversed at regular intervals and thus maintain a high temperature in the incoming air By allowing new furnaces to be built without the expense of regenerators and especially with the added benefit of nitrogen oxide reduction which allows glass plants to meet emission restrictions oxyfuel is cost effective without the need to reduce CO emissions Oxyfuel combustion also reduces CO release at the glass plant location although this may be offset by CO production due to electric power generation which is necessary to produce oxygen for the combustion process

Oxyfuel combustion may also be cost effective in the incineration of low BTU value hazardous waste fuels It is often combined with staged combustion for nitrogen oxide reduction since pure oxygen can stabilize combustion characteristics of a flame

There are pilot plants undergoing initial proofofconcept testing to evaluate the technologies for scaling up to commercial plants including

One case study of oxyfuel combustion is the attempted White Rose plant in North Yorkshire United Kingdom The planned project was an oxyfuel power plant coupled with air separation to capture two million tons of carbon dioxide per year The carbon dioxide would then be delivered by pipeline to be sequestered in a saline aquifer beneath the North Sea However in late 2015 and early 2016 following withdrawal of funding by the Drax Group and the UK government construction was halted The unforeseen loss of the federal CCS Commercialisation Programme along with decreased subsidies for renewable energy left the White Rose Plant with insufficient funds to continue development

AlFawwar spring
AlFawwar spring  Nab alFawwar is a spring found in northern Syria in a town called Zweitina which is administratively belonging to the Homs Governorate

It is one of the most important landmarks in the town because of its religious significance as it is located near the Saint George Monastery AlFawwar is basically a small grotto which is entered by going down a few steps where water is released from a few openings The spring is known for flowing sporadically with random time intervals the spring might not flow in days or even months Loud sounds emitted from the underground would usually signal that the spring will flow and are heard minutes before the it starts flowing The water would usually keep on flowing for a few hours sometimes a day or two and the water would spread to smaller springs This phenomenon is explainable though the water at the opening traps the air and under high pressure the air pushes the water and causes this random strong flow of water People regard this event as a good sign of good luck and are always happy when this happens The spring is surrounded with many restaurants cafeterias and hotels Thousands visit the AlFawwar spring every year mainly tourists and visitors visiting the monastery

This spring was called Sabte during the reign of the Roman emperor Titus in Syria

Query complexity
In descriptive complexity a query is a mapping from structures of one signature to structures of another vocabulary Neil Immerman in his book Descriptive Complexity uses the concept of query as the fundamental paradigm of computation p 17

Given signatures formula1 and formula2 we define the set of structures on each language formula3 and formula4 A query is then any mapping

formula5

Computational complexity theory can then be phrased in terms of the power of the mathematical logic necessary to express a given query

A query is orderindependent if the ordering of objects in the structure does not affect the results of the query In databases these queries correspond to generic queries Immerman 1999 p 18 A query is orderindependent iff formula6 for any isomorphic structures formula7 and formula8

Mimi le Duck is a musical with book and lyrics by Diana HansenYoung and music by Brian Feinstein Mimi Le Duck premiered at the Adirondack Theater Festival in 2004 followed by a run at the Fringe Festival that same year The musical opened on November 6 2006 OffBroadway at New World Stages Directed by Tom Caruso the cast featured Tom Aldredge Candy Buckley Robert DuSold Allen Fitzpatrick Annie Golden Ken Jennings Marcus Neville and Eartha Kitt with musical staging by Matt West The production closed on December 3 2006 after 28 previews and 30 regular performances

The musical had scenic design by Tony Awardwinner John Arnone costume design by Tony Awardwinner Ann HouldWard lighting design by David Lander and sound design by Tony Smolenski IV and Walter Trarbach

The plot follows Miriam Golden a discontented Mormon housewife from Ketchum Idaho who in a moment of desperate inspiration and a visit from the ghost of Ernest Hemingway packs her bags and moves to Paris leaving behind her husband and her successful career as a painter of duck canvases for QVC

The show received some of the worst reviews of the 200607 season Neil Genzlingers review in the New York Times was dismissive focusing on the legendary status of Eartha Kitt who plays but a minor role stating that she was really the only one character worth mentioning The review went on to say that 
assorted other characters materialize all laboriously wacky Diana HansenYoung who wrote the book and lyrics the music is by Brian Feinstein may be the kind of person whose idea of outrageous doesnt go much further than Milton Berle

Frank Scheck of the New York Post wrote 
As has become depressingly common lately in musicals the score by Brian Feinstein music and Diana HansenYoung book and lyrics is utterly generic and forgettable failing to bring any life to the insipid scenario
Larry Worth of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Accordingly in the spirit of a show where bad puns and hoary platitudes rule maybe it is fitting that Mimi le Duck brings new meaning to foul play

Varietys was similarly unimpressed stating How do you say vanity production in French

Mimi le Duck has inspired a small cult following at colleges and universities around America with some students reporting little rubber duckies with mimi written on them left on their seats in classes

Fred Ellis cartoonist
Fred C Ellis 18851965 was an American editorial cartoonist He is best remembered as one of the leading radical artists of the 1920s and 1930s as an artist for various publications of the Communist Party USA CPUSA including stints on the staff of the CPUSAs daily newspaper

Fred Ellis was born in Chicago Illinois in 1885 He left school after eighth grade to take a job as an office boy for Frank Lloyd Wright He worked later in an engraving shop and an ice cream factory before becoming a trucker at a meat factory transporting prepared meat from refrigerators to railway cars for shipment around the country

In 1905 the 20yearold Ellis was among 20000 Chicago packinghouse workers who went out on strike with the truckers seeking a pay raise from the 198 the workers were then averaging per 12hour day The strike proved to be a failure ended by the economic pressure exerted through the hiring of strikebreakers and Ellis and his mates ultimately returned to work only to see their pay cut further

Despite the poor rate of pay Ellis nevertheless managed to save 100 over a threeyear period which he chose to invest in his education Having a proclivity for drawing Ellis enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts where he studied art for two months quitting after his finances were depleted

After leaving school Ellis became a sign painter specializing in the painting of large outdoor signs He ultimately worked for 21 years at this trade

In 1919 while working as a sign painter for the General Outdoor Advertising Company Ellis slipped and fell five stories from a scaffold outside of a Chicago building breaking 32 bones when he hit the asphalt below Elliss convalescence proved to be extensive including six weeks in the hospital followed by two years during which he was forced to use crutches and a cane During this period of recovery Ellis became familiar with a new weekly magazine published by the Chicago Federation of Labor called The New Majority  a publication which reprinted radical drawings by such leading political artists of the day as Art Young and Boardman Robinson The injured sign painter began to work as a cartoonist submitting his first political art to The New Majority

Prominent communist labor leader William Z Foster was the circulation manager of The New Majority at this time and it was through him that Ellis made contact with the Workers Party of America which he joined in 1924 Ellis drew extensively for the Communist movement from 1923 onward contributing material to The Daily Worker The Liberator the Labor Herald and other publications

In 1927 Ellis moved to New York City to become staff cartoonist of the Workers Communist Partys official newspaper The Daily Worker

From 1930 to 1936 Ellis lived and worked in Berlin and Moscow where he drew for Pravda Izvestiya and the Englishlanguage Moscow Daily News

In 1936 he returned to his job at the Daily Worker and taught at the American Artists School a progressive independent art school directed by Harry Gottlieb whose board included many prominent left wing artists such as William Gropper as well as photographer Margaret BourkeWhite

Ellis retired in 1955

Fred Ellis died in 1965

Elliss papers are held by Syracuse University in Syracuse New York The material includes more than 250 original cartoons a sketchbook with more than 200 sketches letters newspaper clippings photographs and other material

Literary adaptation
Literary adaptation is the adapting of a literary source eg a novel short story poem to another genre or medium such as a film stage play or video game It can also involve adapting the same literary work in the same genre or medium just for different purposes eg to work with a smaller cast in a smaller venue or on the road or for a different demographic group such as adapting a story for children Sometimes the editing of these works without the approval of the author can lead to a court case

It also appeals because it obviously works as a story it has interesting characters who say and do interesting things This is particularly important when adapting to a dramatic work eg film stage play teleplay as dramatic writing is some of the most difficult To get an original story to function well on all the necessary dimensionsconcept character story dialogue and actionis an extremely rare event performed by a rare talent

Perhaps most importantly especially for producers of the screen and stage an adapted work is more bankable it represents considerably less risk to investors and poses the possibilities of huge financial gains This is because

Works of literature have been adapted for film from the dawn of the industry Some of the earliest examples come from the work of Georges Mlis who pioneered many film techniques In 1899 he released two adaptationsCinderella based on the Brothers Grimm story of the same name and King John the first known film to be based on the works of Shakespeare The 1900 film Sherlock Holmes Baffled directed by Arthur Marvin featured Arthur Conan Doyles detective character Sherlock Holmes intruding upon a pseudosupernatural burglary The film considered the first detective movie ran for only 30 seconds and was originally intended to be shown in handcranked Mutoscope machines

Mlis 1902 original sciencefiction feature A Trip to the Moon was based loosely on two popular novels of the time Jules Vernes From the Earth to the Moon and H G Wells The First Men in the Moon The first of many adaptations of the Brothers Grimm tale Snow White was released in 1902 while the earliest surviving copy is the 1916 version 1903 saw the release of Alice in Wonderland directed by Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow the first movie adaptation of Lewis Carrolls childrens book Alices Adventures in Wonderland

The first featurelength film to be shot entirely in Hollywood was Cecil B DeMilles first assignment The Squaw Man in 1914 which was the first of three movie versions all directed by DeMille based on Edwin Milton Royles play of the same name Since the early days of the genre major films have been largely adapted
The most celebrated of the early adaptations is Erich von Stroheims Greed a 1924 adaptation of the 1899 novel McTeague by naturalist writer Frank Norris The director intended to film every aspect of the novel in great detail resulting in a 9hour epic feature At studio insistence the film was cut down to two hours and was considered a flop upon its theatrical release It has since been restored to just over four hours and is considered one of the greatest films ever made 

One book that has been adapted very frequently in one form or another is Charles Dickens Christmas story A Christmas Carol which has around 20 film adaptations to date

From a legal standpoint when a literary source has not passed into the public domain rights must be arranged for the adaptation to be performed legally Plagiarism occurs in every genre and throughout history but such literary rights violations can be challenged in court In the case of Hollywood films judgments for the plaintiff can run into the millions of dollars but these have typically been for outright theft of a screenplay idea rather than for fraudulent adaptations see Buchwald v Paramount

Because of the importance of telling a story with a limited number of characters short stories often make better sources for adaptable material than do novels For the stage in addition theater audiences tend to accept and prefer works of a more conceptual thoughtbased nature meaning their preferences need to be considered when selecting a work for adaptation but also when determining how best to adapt it The stage imposes physical limits of size and technology Not every illusion that can be made to appear real on the movie screen can be made to appear so on stage

<doc id="7727103" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7727103" title="Selfbuild">
Selfbuild
Selfbuild is the practice of creating an individual home for oneself through a variety of different methods The selfbuilders input into this process varies from doing the actual building work to contracting out all the work to an architect or building package company

People build individual homes for all sorts of reasons An important reason above all in poor countries is that they might not be able to afford their housing on the open market Another motivation of selfbuilders can be the wish to create something tailored to their familys requirements andor their lifestyle

Selfbuilders create their homes through a variety of methods  and seldom build it entirely themselves In rich countries a lot of them employ an architect to come up with the design of the new home and contract a builder to construct it others use socalled package companies to provide a onestop solution Many others find themselves managing building sites and dealing directly with planners tradespeople and materials suppliers

Selfbuild in its wider meaning is an ordinary practice in many developing countries It is also common among certain religious communities like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints LDS Church or subcultures such as hippies Usually ecovillages are realised through self building techniques In most developed countries selfbuild is regulated by the public administration while in developing countries selfbuild is sometimes supported by NGOs or international organisations like for instance United Nations Volunteers

In 2010 the World Bank estimated that selfbuild housing also described as selfhelp or selfprovided housing was supplying more than 95 of Ghanas total housing stock and that it was contributing with around 300 billion USDs per annum to the national economy Selfbuild is not just practised by the poorer households but also by middleincome citizens Most of Ghanas postcolonials governments like Nkrumahs have been implementing staterun housing schemes because their socialistoriented agendas avoided to promote selfhelp housing in order not to boost private ownership by individuals or families In 2009 the Government of Ghana in its Draft National Shelter Policy recognized the importance of selfhelp and selfbuild housing and other nonconventional approaches to housing even if not as a priority

In Italy selfbuild has been fore some decades after World War II a common practice among the lower class widely used in squatting areas like the Borgate Romane Rome or the suburbs in the north of Naples and around Palermo Nowadays selfbuild is rather used as a partial support to house building where the construction of the structural parts foundation walls roof  is committed to professionals companies
Another application field for selfbuild in Italy is the support to disadvantaged ethnic groups like Sinti In some middlesized cities like Ravenna and Padova masonry classes and build materials were offered to people living in gypsies equipped areas in order to help them to improve their huts
In the early 1980s selfbuild also entered the Italian university programmes in the architecture faculty of Politecnico di Torino Giorgio Ceragioli introduced in his course of Architectural technology the Laboratorio tecnologico di autocostruzione Latec a laboratory where students were allowed to practice several selfbuild techniques

In Mexico a very rapid urbanization occurred between 1940s and 1970s attracting lots of people from rural areas During this period government programmes were not able to ensure enough housing and also the private production was unattractive due the low wages of a large part of the population Is estimated that even after the creation of two national housing funds FONHAPO and INFONAVIT just 15 of the effective demand was satisfied In this difficult situation many irregular settlements developed and some researcher and politician started to sustain that supporting and improving selfbuild processes rather to fight them was a possible solution to the popular housing issue So during 1970s public policy started to support lowincome selfbuilder offering them services core units and in some cases landownership regularization These schemes were criticised by orthodox Marxists persuaded that ensuring proper housing to people was a government duty and that lack of houses was a structural product of capitalism Anyway selfbuilt accommodation became the most common form of housing and in Mexico city area it increased from 14 in 1952 to 60 in 1990 Later on the public policy priority shifted from house production to enhancement of realestate market local infrastructures and improvement of existing houses

The term self build is specifically used in the UK and Ireland when an individual obtains a building plot and then builds their own home on that plot The term doesnt necessarily refer to completing the work yourself  more usually selfbuild is defined as the act of commissioning a bespoke home

Its estimated that there are between 10000 and 20000 self builds in the UK every year This is less than 10 of all the homes built annually but may constitute as much as 1 in 3 new detached homes built in the UK Over the years selfbuilders have been at the forefront of advances inhouse design and technology being responsible for the dramatic uptake in recent years in ecofeatures such as solar power and heat pumps underfloor heating open plan design and smart home technology These are features that take many years to filter through to commercial housing developments There is also an increasing drive for people to selfbuild overseas either as investments holiday homes retirement homes or relocation

Individual houses can take all forms from the traditional to the radically modern and the term is also used to refer to people who create individual homes out of old buildings

The main impediment to the UK selfbuild market is the shortage of building plots available to the selfbuilder high land prices and the restrictive planning regime in 2008 the National Self Build Association NaSBA was established to order to put pressure on relevant bodies including the Government to remedy this situation The founding members of NaSBA are Bath and District Self Build Association Build It magazine BuildStore PottonKingspan Architecture Verte and Ecomotive
The Association changed its name to the National Custom  Self Build Association NaCSBA in July 2014  borne out of a desire to officially welcome the custom build community

Ensi Sumerian
Ensi cuneiform  lord of the plowland Emesal dialect umunsik  was a Sumerian title designating the ruler or prince of a citystate Originally it may have designated an independent ruler but in later periods the title presupposed subordinance to a lugal

For the Early Dynastic Period about 28002350 BCE the meaning of the titles en ensi and lugal cannot be differentiated clearly see lugal ensi and en for details Ens may have originally been a designation of the ruler restricted to Lagash and Umma The ensi was considered a representative of the citystates patron deity In later periods an ens was normally seen as subordinate to a lugal Nevertheless even the powerful rulers of the Second Dynasty of Lagash c 2100 BCE such as Gudea were satisfied with the title ens

During the Third Dynasty of Ur about 21002000 BCE nsi referred to the provincial governors of the kingdom These exercised great powers in terms of government tax revenue and jurisdiction but they were supervised installed and dismissed by the lugal of Ur Although the office could be inherited all ens had to be endorsed by the lugal No independent foreign policy or warfare was allowed

In the citystate of Assur the hereditary ruler bore the Akkadian language version of the title ens while the patron deity was regarded as arrum king

<doc id="7727149" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7727149" title="Separated shoulder">
Separated shoulder
A separated shoulder also known as acromioclavicular joint injury is a common injury to the acromioclavicular joint The AC joint is located at the outer end of the clavicle where it attaches to the acromion of the scapula Symptoms include pain which may make it difficult to move the shoulder and often a deformity
It is most commonly due to a fall onto the front and upper part of the shoulder when the arm is by the side They are classified as type I II III IV V or VI with the higher the number the more severe the injury Diagnosis is typically based on physical examination and Xrays In type I and II injuries there is minimal deformity while in a type III injury the deformity resolves upon lifting the arm upwards In type IV V and VI the deformity does not resolve with lifting the arm
Generally types I and II are treated without surgery while type III may be treated with or without surgery and types IV V and VI are treated with surgery For type I and II treatment is usually with a sling and pain medications for a week or two In type III injuries surgery is generally only done if symptoms remain following treatment without surgery
A separated shoulder is a common injury among those involved in sports especially contact sports It makes up about half of shoulder injuries among those who play hockey football and rugby Those affected are typically 20 to 30 years old Males are more often affected than females The injury was initially classified in 1967 with the current classification from 1984

Separated shoulders often occur in people who participate in sports such as football soccer horseback riding hockey parkour combat sports rowing rugby snowboarding skateboarding crack the whip cycling roller derby and wrestling The separation is classified into 6 types with 1 through 3 increasing in severity and 4 through 6 being the most severe The most common mechanism of injury is a fall on the tip of the shoulder or also a fall on an outstretched hand In falls where the force is transmitted indirectly often only the acromioclavicular ligament is affected and the coracoclavicular ligaments remain unharmed In ice hockey the separation is sometimes due to a lateral force as when one gets forcefully checked into the side of the rink

The acromion of the scapula is connected to the clavicle by the superior acromioclavicular ligament The coracoclavicular ligaments connect the clavicle to the coracoid process The two ligaments that form the coracoclavicular ligaments are the trapezoid and conoid ligaments These three ligaments add support to the shoulder joint

There are four types of soft tissue disruptions that may cause acromioclavicular separation


Diagnosis is based on physical examination and an xray A physical examination can identify point tenderness pain at the AC joint with crossarm adduction and pain relief with an injection of a local anesthetic The crossarm adduction will produce pain specifically at the AC joint and will be done by elevating the arm to a 90 angle flexing the elbow to a 90 angle and adducting the arm across the chest The pain in the shoulder is hard to pinpoint of the innervation of the AC joint and the glenohumeral joint An injury to the AC joint will result in pain over the AC joint in the anterolateral neck and in the region in the anterolateral deltoid

Xray indicates a separated shoulder when the acromioclavicular joint space is widened it is normally 5 to 8 mm

It can be classified into 6 types

A Type I AC separation involves direct trauma to the shoulder causing the injury to ligaments that form the joint but no severe tearing or fracture It is commonly referred to as a sprain

A Type II AC separation involves complete tearing of the acromioclavicular ligament as well as a partial tear of the coracoclavicular ligaments This often causes a noticeable bump on the shoulder This bump is permanent The clavicle is unstable to direct stress examination On radiographs the lateral end of the clavicle may be slightly elevated by pressing on the sternal aspect of the clavicle forcing the acromial end down and by releasing it may pop back up eliciting a piano key sign due to the tearing of the AC Severe pain and loss of movement are common

In a Type III AC separation both acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments are torn without significant disruption of the deltoid or trapezial fascia A significant bump resulting in some shoulder deformity is formed by the lateral end of the clavicle This bump caused by the clavicles dislocation is permanent The clavicle can be moved in and out of place on the shoulder A radiographic examination will show the results as abnormal Pain with motion can be severe

This is a type III injury with avulsion of the coracoclavicular ligament from the clavicle with the distal clavicle displaced posteriorly into or through the trapezius and may tent the posterior skin A displaced clavicle is easily seen on a radiograph It is important to evaluate the sternoclavicular joint also because there can be an anterior dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint and posterior dislocation of the AC joint This injury is generally acknowledged to require surgery

This is a more severe form of a type III injury with the trapezial and deltoid fascia stripped off of the acromion as well as the clavicle This is type III but with exaggeration of the vertical displacement of the clavicle from the scapula Distinguishing between Type III and Type V separations based on radiographs is difficult and often unreliable between surgeons Type V is manifested by a 2 to 3fold increase in the coracoclavicular distance The shoulder manifests as a severe droop secondary to downward displacement of the scapula and humerus due to loss of the clavicular strut This injury generally requires surgery

This is type III with inferior dislocation of the distal end of the clavicle below the coracoid This injury is associated with severe trauma and frequently accompanied by multiple other injuries The mechanism is thought to be severe hyperabduction and external rotation of the arm combined with retraction of the scapula The distal clavicle is found in 2 orientations either subacromial or subcoracoid With the subcoracoid dislocation the clavicle becomes lodged behind the intact conjoined tendon The posterior superior AC ligaments which often remains attached to the acromion get displaced into the AC interval making anatomic reduction difficult The tissue needs to be surgically cleared and then reattached after reduction Most patients with type VI injuries have paresthesia that resolves after relocation of the clavicle It is extremely rare and generally only involved with motor vehicle collisions This requires surgery
Treatment of a separated shoulder depends on the severity of the injury When beginning treatment the first steps should be to control inflammation and to rest and ice the joint Antiinflammatories such as Advil or Motrin may also relieve pain and inflammation The joint should be iced every four hours for fifteen minutes at a time One can wear a sling until the pain subsides then simple exercises can be started

Type I and type II shoulder separation are the most common types of separated and rarely need surgery However the risk of arthritis with type II separations is greatly increased If it becomes severe the Mumford procedure or distal clavicle excision can be performed

Most nonsurgical treatment options include physical therapy to build up the muscles and help stabilize the joint Literature regarding longterm followup after surgical repair of type III injuries is scarce and those treated nonoperatively generally do quite well
Many studies 
have come to the conclusion that nonsurgical treatment is as good as or better than surgical treatment or that anything attained because of surgery is quite limited It appears that after a while the body remodels the joint either expanding the distal clavicle or causing it to atrophy There may also be the potential that surgical repair may be less painful in the long run

Once the pain has eased rangeofmotion exercises can be started followed by a strength training program The strength training will include strengthening of the rotator cuff and shoulder blade muscles With most cases the pain goes away after three weeks Although full recovery can take up to six weeks for type II and up to twelve weeks for type III

Those who do have a separated shoulder will most often return to having full function although some may have continued pain in the area of the AC joint With the continued pain there are some things that maybe causing it It may be due to an abnormal contact between the bone ends when the joint is in motion the development of arthritis or an injury to a piece of the cushioning cartilage that is found between the bone ends of this joint

Type IV V and VI shoulder separations are very uncommon but always require surgery There is some debate among orthopedic surgeons however about the treatment of type III shoulder separation Many with type III shoulder separation who do not undergo surgical treatment recover just as well as those who do receive it and avoid the added risks that surgery may present Those who opt out of surgery also have faster recovery times and are able to return to work or sports sooner Some studies suggest early surgical treatment of type III separation may benefit laborers and athletes who perform overhead motions The potential benefit of surgical treatment for type III remains unproven

There have been many surgeries described to fix complete acromioclavicular separations including recently arthroscopic There is no consensus on which surgery is best Several surgeries have been described with pins or hooks Another surgery performs muscle transfer

A common surgery is some form of Modified WeaverDunn procedure which involves cutting off the end of the clavicle portion partially sacrificing the coracoacromial ligament and suturing the displaced acromial end to the lateral aspect of the clavicle for stabilization then often some form of additional support is introduced to replace the coracoclavicular ligaments Variations of this support includes grafting of tendons from the leg or the use of synthetic sutures or suture anchors Other surgeries have used a Rockwood screw that is inserted initially and then removed after 12 weeks Physical therapy is always recommended after surgery and most patients get flexibility back although possibly somewhat limited

After one does have surgery a sling should be worn to support and protect the shoulder for a few days For the first couple physical therapy visits the treatment will focus on controlling the pain and swelling Type of treatment can include ice and electrical stimulation massage or other hand on treatment to help ease the pain and muscle spasm After about four weeks range of motion exercises can be started Passive exercises are done which the shoulder joint is moved but the muscles stay relaxed After about six to eight weeks active therapy is started Such exercises can include isometric strengthening which works the muscles without straining the healing of the joint After about three months more active strengthening will be incorporated which focus on improving the strength and control of the rotator cuff muscles and the muscles around the shoulder blade The exercises that the therapist gives the patient to be done at home should be done to be able to get a better recovery in the long run

Some physical therapy exercises that can be performed to help rehab the shoulder are
While standing and using a theraband you can perform 
Y T and Is 
Internal shoulder rotation 
External shoulder rotation 
Shoulder extensions and 
Scapula squeezes 
While lying on your side you can perform internal rotation and external rotation with a light weight The light weight can be any type of object such as a 15lb dumbbell weight or a soup can Also you can foam roll the pectorals With the foam roller you can also lie on your back on top of it and do snow angels

<doc id="7727159" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7727159" title="Innerplatform effect">
Innerplatform effect
The innerplatform effect is the tendency of software architects to create a system so customizable as to become a replica and often a poor replica of the software development platform they are using This is generally inefficient and such systems are often considered to be examples of an antipattern

Examples are visible in pluginbased software such as some text editors and web browsers which often have developers create plugins that recreate software that would normally run on top of the operating system itself The Firefox addon mechanism has been used to develop a number of FTP clients and file browsers which effectively replicate some of the features of the operating system albeit on a more restricted platform

In the database world developers are sometimes tempted to bypass the RDBMS for example by storing everything in one big table with three columns labelled entity ID key and value While this entityattributevalue model allows the developer to break out from the structure imposed by an SQL database it loses out on all the benefits since all of the work that could be done efficiently by the RDBMS is forced onto the application instead Queries become much more convoluted the indexes and query optimizer can no longer work effectively and data validity constraints are not enforced Performance and maintainability can be extremely poor

A similar temptation exists for XML where developers sometimes favor generic element names and use attributes to store meaningful information For example every element might be named item and have attributes type and value This practice requires joins across multiple attributes in order to extract meaning As a result XPath expressions are more convoluted evaluation is less efficient and structural validation provides little benefit

Another example is the phenomenon of web desktops where a whole desktop environmentoften including a web browserruns inside a browser which itself typically runs within the desktop environment provided by the operating system A desktop within a desktop can be unusually awkward for the user and hence this is generally only done to run programs that cannot easily be deployed on end user systems or by hiding the outer desktop away

It is normal for software developers to create a library of custom functions that relate to their specific project The innerplatform effect occurs when this library expands to include general purpose functions that duplicate functionality already available as part of the programming language or platform Since each of these new functions will generally call a number of the original functions they tend to be slower and if poorly coded less reliable as well

On the other hand such functions are often created to present a simpler and often more portable abstraction layer on top of lower level services that either have an awkward interface are too complex nonportable or insufficiently portable or simply a poor match for higher level application code

An inner platform can be useful for portability and privilege separation reasonsin other words so that the same application can run on a wide variety of outer platforms without affecting anything outside a sandbox managed by the inner platform For example Sun Microsystems designed the Java platform to meet both of these goals

Clan Hannay
Clan Hannay is a Lowland Scottish clan

The Hannays are from the ancient princedom of Galloway The name appears to have originally been spelt Ahannay but its origin is uncertain It could derive from the Scottish Gaelic OHannaidh or Ap Shenaeigh

In 1296 Gilbert de Hannethe appears on the Ragman Rolls submitting to Edward I of England This could be the same Gilbert who acquired the lands of Sorbie The Hannays were suspicious of Robert the Bruces ambitions and instead supported the claim of John Balliol Balliol was descended from the Celtic Princes of Galloway through his mother Lady Devorgilla

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the Hannays extended their influence over the surrounding area including the building of Sorbie Tower which remained the seat of the Clan Chief until the seventeenth century

At the beginning of the 17th century the Clan Hannay was locked in a deadly feud with the Clan Murray of Broughton It resulted in the Hannays being outlawed The consequences of this were that many Hannays emigrated to Ulster where the name is still found in large numbers in County Antrim County Down and County Armagh

Patrick Hannay had a distinguished military career and was patronised by Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia daughter of James VI of Scotland and sister of Charles I of England After the death of Queen Anne who was the wife of James VI in 1619 Patrick Hannay composed two eulogies and in return had many published on his own death one of which said Go on in virtue aftertimes will tell none but Hannay could have done so well

Possibly the best known Hannay was James Hannay the Dean of St Giles in Edinburgh who had the claim to fame of being the target of Jenny Geddes stool In an infamous incident in 1637 the Dean had begun to read the new liturgy when with a cry of Thou false thief dost thou say Mass at my lug was heard and a stool came flying from the congregation thrown by an incensed Jenny Geddes The incident began a fullscale riot which took the town guard to control

Sir Robert Hannay of Mochrum was created a Baronet of Nova Scotia In 1630 From the Sorbie roots the Hannays of Grennan Knock Garrie and Kingsmuir also evolved

In 1582 Alexander Hannay a younger son of the chief Hannay of Sorbie purchased the lands of Kirkdale which were in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright His son was John Hannay of Kirkdalewho established the line which is today recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as the chief of the name and arms of Hannay

A younger son of Hannay of Kirkdale was Alexander Hannay who was a professional soldier administrator and adventurer who amassed a substantial personal fortune in 18th Century India rising to the rank of colonel His elder brother was Sir Samuel Hannay of Kirkdale who succeeded to the title and estates of his kinsman Sir Robert Hannay of Mochrum Baront The next Baronet was Sir Samuel Hannay who entered the service of the Habsburg Emperors and built himself a mansion on his family lands It is this mansion which is said to have provided the inspiration for Walter Scotts novel Guy Mannering Sir Samuel died in 1841 and the estate passed to his sister Mary and from her to her nephew William Ransford Hannay from whom the present chief is descended

Clan chief Chief Ramsay William Rainsford Hannay Died 10 January 2004  GatehouseofFleet Scotland and was succeeded by his son Dr David R Hannay

In 1965 the ancient clan seat Sorbie Tower was presented to the clan trust and a maintenance scheme was put in place

<doc id="7727353" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7727353" title="Malagueas flamenco style">
Malagueas flamenco style
Malagueas  is one of the traditional styles of Andalusian music flamenco derived from earlier types of fandango from the area of Mlaga classified among the Cantes de Levante Originally a folksong type it became a flamenco style in the 19th century It is not normally used for dance as it is generally interpreted with no regular rhythmic pattern as a cante libre It has a very rich melody with virtuous flourishes and use of microtones Its guitar accompaniment is normally played in open position first inversion giving E for the tonic which can be transposed by using a capo

Malagueas derive from local variety of the Fandangos a type of dance that with different regional variations and even different names became very popular in great part of Spain in the 18th century Although nowadays malagueas are a typical instance of cante libre performed at libitum and normally not used for the dance folkloric fandangos were originally sung and played at a fast speed with a rhythmic pattern in  to accompany dance Some of these primitive fandangos from Mlaga called Verdiales are still performed nowadays at folkloric gatherings by large nonprofessional groups called Pandas which use a high number of guitars bandurrias a sort of mandoline violins and tambourines

Towards the second half of the 19th century some interpreters gave the first steps in transforming this folkloric songs into real flamenco They slowed it down although still keeping the eastern fandango rhythm pattern known as abandolao they enriched the melody with flourishes and ornaments and reduced accompanying instruments to a single guitar In this process they were probably influenced by other flamenco styles but modern research also suggests that the influence of Opera Zarzuela and other classical music styles also played a part in this development

The oldest malaguea of this type that has been preserved to our days is probably the Jabera  This was first mentioned by writer Serafin Estbanez Caldern probably in the 1840s According to this contemporary witness this type of malaguea would have been created by an artist known as La Jabera This early malaguea type still preserved a rhythmic pattern as those of later artists like Juan Breva Most of the malaguea types were created in the last decades of the 19th century

The third step in the evolution was the total loss of a rhythmic pattern This development was brought forward by singers like Antonio Chacn Enrique el Mellizo and guitarists like Ramn Montoya none of whom had been born in the area of Mlaga so they had not grown in contact with the original folkloric fandangos They were in a sense creators of a completely new style fashioned by professional or semiprofessional artists

Some of the traditional malaguea styles melodic schemes more frequently performed are listed below Many though have been omitted as they are rarely performed or are just variations of other main styles

1 Juan Breva He recorded three of his malaguea styles personally in the early 20th century

2 Enrique el Mellizo It is often said that he derived his malaguea from the preface to the catholic mass After his influence the rhythmic pattern of the malaguea guitar accompaniment was lost and it became a cante libre Among the interpreters of this style who helped to establish it we may mention El Nio de la Isla Aurelio Sell Manolo Caracol and Pericn de Cdiz Each of them has added personal touches to the Malaguea so it is difficult to know which one resembles the original model most

3 El Canario He created one style of Malaguea

4 Antonio Chacn He was the most prolific creator of malagueas and the styles he created are probably the most frequent in recordings The number of the malagueas he created varies though as some have been attributed to him only by tradition Some of these styles can often be seen as simple variations Most of these styles were already recorded by him between 1909 and 1928

5 La Trini Her legacy was preserved by singers like Sebastin el Pena Antonio Chacn created a personal variation of one of her styles

Originally the guitar was together with other instruments already part of the accompaniment of folkloric fandango of Mlaga At that time its function was merely rhythmic and limited to the use of one technique the strumming pattern called abandolao As malagueas slowed down their tempo and professional guitarists came into place short solos and ornaments were incorporated The great revolution of the malaguea guitar playing came together with its transformation into a cante libre flamenco virtuosos like Ramn Montoya started introducing classical guitar techniques like arpeggio scales tremolo and enriched it with a wider variety of chord positions They also started introducing short guitar solos in between verses called falsetas in the flamenco jargon following the model of other flamenco songs

Malaguea is rarely performed as a guitar instrumental piece and very rarely danced

The singing develops on a major mode tonic subdominant dominant resolving in the corresponding Phrygian mode of the same scale The Phrygian mode is used for the short interludes after of before verses The usual progression is the typical of all fandangos


To this typical progression other transition chords can be added For example D7 is often used in the transition to G Major A minor often appears in guitar interludes or even during the singing as in the case of the Malaguea del Mellizo These chords can also be transported by using a capo on the guitar maintaining the same chord positions

Its melodies are normally lyric in style and very ornate Malaguea has traditionally been favoured by mellow voices but there are many exceptions to this rule Quite often flamenco singers after singing a several verses of malaguea in cante libre style link directly with the more vivid styles of Fandangos abandolaos

Guerguerat
Guerguerat     is a small village in the far south west of Western Sahara 11km from the border with Mauritania and 5km from the Atlantic Ocean The village is under the control of Morocco The Moroccan passport control stamp bears the name of Bir Gandouz a nearby village
Morocco sees this frontier post as the southernmost barrier protecting the European Union

The area between the Moroccan frontier post and the Mauritanian frontier is seen by Morocco as a no mans land and by the Polisario as part of the RASD

In January 2015 the Polisario established a military presence in La Gera on the seaside but apparently did not yet start controlling passports of people transiting to Mauritania

Since February 2017 the Gendarmerie Nationale   started to hoist flags and turn back Moroccan lorries showing the contour of Morocco including Western Sahara
The importance of Guerguerat to Morocco lies in two aspects Moroccan exports of vegetables to Mauritania especially to Nouadhibou run through this border station and it is the only way for Moroccans to leave their country by land without a visa to another country
The importance of Guerguerat to the SADR lies in the fact that this is the only location where it can exert pressure on Morocco by isolating it from Mauritania

Black and White Ball
The Black and White Ball was a masquerade ball held on November 28 1966 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City Hosted by author Truman Capote the ball was in honor of The Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham

Truman Capote decided in June 1966 to throw a lavish party He was at the height of his popularity as an author and as a public figure following the publication of his nonfiction novel In Cold Blood earlier that year For the first time Capote had the financial resources to host a party he deemed worthy of the friends he had cultivated in high society

According to Capotes friend the writer and editor Leo Lerman Capote had declared in 1942 on a journey to the writers colony Yaddo that when he Capote became rich and famous he would throw a party for his rich and famous friends Capote always discounted the story but through constant repetition it became part of the balls legend

Capotes friend author Dominick Dunne had given a black and white ball in 1964 for his tenth wedding anniversary Capote attended with Alvin Dewey and others he had met while researching In Cold Blood Capote was also inspired by the Ascot scene from the film My Fair Lady in which the women were all dressed in black and white

After deciding to throw the party Capote had to select a guest of honor Throwing the party for himself would have been viewed by his society friends as vulgar Rather than selecting from amongst his stable of beautiful society women he called his swans Capote chose The Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham Truman called me up that summer and said I think you need cheering up And Im going to give you a ballI wassort of baffledI felt a little bit like Truman was going to give the ball anyway and that I was part of the props

For his venue Capote chose the Grand Ballroom of the Plaza Hotel in New York City Capote had long held a deep affection for the Plaza even setting the opening scene of his attempted first novel Summer Crossing in a Plaza dining room Capote enlisted Evie Backer who had decorated his apartment at United Nations Plaza for the events decor Initially Capote planned to cover the ballrooms white and gold walls with heavy red drapes but Backer and Capotes friend Babe Paley convinced him to abandon this idea Instead he brought in the color with red tablecloths Rather than flowers Capote had the tables adorned with gold candelabra wound with smilax and bearing white tapers The nights menu to be served at midnight consisted of scrambled eggs sausages biscuits pastries spaghetti and meatballs and chicken hash a specialty of the Plaza and one of Capotes favorite dishes To drink Capote laid in 450 bottles of Taittinger champagne

Capote spent a total of 16000 on the ball

Capote purchased a blackandwhite composition book and spent most of July sitting by his friend Eleanor Friedes pool compiling his initial guest list Capote carried the book with him everywhere he went for the next three months constantly adding and deleting names

Before the ball many of the guests attended one of sixteen small private dinner parties that Capotes friends had been drafted to host

The Black and White Ball was credited with starting an immediate upsurge in masquerade and costume parties It has been described as a pinnacle of New Yorks social history Six days after the ball on the December 4 episode of the television panel show Whats My Line panelist Arlene Francis wore the mask she had worn at the party transformed into a blindfold The wearing of blindfolds during the shows special Mystery Guest segment was customary on the part of the panel

Princess Yasmin Aga Khan hosted a Black and White Ball in 1991 commemorating the 25th anniversary of the original The ball held in a tent outside Tavern on the Green was a charity event that raised 14 million for the Alzheimers Association

In anticipation of selling the contents of the Plaza Hotel Christies Auction House recreated the Black and White Ball in 2006 at Rockefeller Center The event followed Capotes dress code schedule and menu exactly and the Peter Duchin Orchestra which had played the original played the recreation

TV chef Ina Garten recreated a scaleddown version of the event for a themed dinner party on her daytime cookery show Barefoot Contessa She served chicken hash followed by French toast and truffles for dessert in keeping with the black and white theme of Capotes party

Continuous positive airway pressure
Continuous positive airway pressure CPAP is a form of positive airway pressure ventilator which applies mild air pressure on a continuous basis to keep the airways continuously open in people who are not able to breathe spontaneously on their own It is an alternative to positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP Both modalities stent the lungs alveoli open and thus recruit more of the lungs surface area for ventilation but while PEEP refers to devices that impose positive pressure only at the end of the exhalation CPAP devices apply continuous positive airway pressure throughout the breathing cycle Thus the ventilator itself does not cycle during CPAP no additional pressure above the level of CPAP is provided and patients must initiate all of their breaths

CPAP typically is used for people who have breathing problems such as sleep apnea CPAP also may be used to treat preterm infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed For example physicians may use CPAP in infants with respiratory distress syndrome It is associated with a decrease in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia In some preterm infants whose lungs have not fully developed CPAP improves survival and decreases the need for steroid treatment for their lungs In resourcelimited settings where CPAP improves respiratory rate and survival in children with primary pulmonary disease researchers have found that nurses can initiate and manage care with once or twice daily physician rounds

CPAP therapy utilizes machines specifically designed to deliver a constant flow of pressure Some CPAP machines have other features as well such as heated humidifiers CPAP is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in which the mild pressure from the CPAP prevents the airway from collapsing or becoming blocked

Although delivery of CPAP through a nasal mask is the most common modality of treatment other systems exist for interfacing with adults and children Nasal CPAP is frequently used in infants though its use is controversial Studies have shown nasal CPAP reduces ventilator time but an increased occurrence of pneumothorax was also prevalent Oral masks and nasooral masks are often used when nasal congestion or obstruction is an issue Devices that combine nasal pressure with maxillary advancement devices MAD also exist

The result was in doubt until the last game was finished on 5 August 1962 the first games had been on 18 January 1961 The sponsors had held back the key games in the scheduling to maintain the tension The result was in the end something few could have predicted Under the competition rules komidashi was 5 points if that made the game a jigo it would be awarded to White This has the same effect as komi of 55 except that as a tiebreak Whites jigo wins were to count less than full wins The final day featured the games between Fujisawa Hideyuki and Hashimoto Shoji and Go Seigen and Sakata Eio Fujisawa lost and disappeared from the Nihon Kiin building in Fukudaya where the other game was in progress When the only result that could have made Fujisawa the winner a jigo win with White for Go Seigen actually happened Fujisawa had to be sought out to inform him that he was after all the first Meijin since Honinbo Shusai had died in 1940 According to Go Review Fujisawa had to be brought back from a bar where he was drowning his sorrows

SS City of Columbus
The passenger steamer City of Columbus ran aground on Devils Bridge off the Gay Head Cliffs in Aquinnah Massachusetts in the early hours of January 18 1884 She was owned by Boston  Savannah Steamship Company and was built in 1878 by John Roach and Sons at Chester Pennsylvania City of Columbus made regular runs from Boston Massachusetts to Savannah Georgia

On January 17 1884 the steamer City of Columbus left Boston with a crew of 45 under the command of Captain Schuler E Wright Wright was very familiar with the area as he had made numerous trips through the reefs and sound of Marthas Vineyard The captain left the City of Columbuss bridge in the hands of his Second Mate Edward Harding and went below to sleep While off Marthas Vineyard at 345 am on January 18 the lookout yelled to the second mate that the Devils Bridge buoy was off the port bow rather than where it should have appeared off the starboard bow just before the ship struck a double ledge of submerged rocks Harding ordered the Quartermaster Roderick A McDonald to go port followed by Captain Wrights order to hard port and once again the City of Columbus smacked against the reef Wright attempted in vain to free the ship Attempts to use the sails only pushed the boat further into the reef After these attempts he decided to go over the obstruction This just made things worse The captain gathered the 87 passengers from below and was in the midst of explaining their situation when a rush of water into the cabin forced all to the top deck where a giant wave struck the boat and swept all women and children and many of the men into the frozen waters

Two lifeboats were launched from the City of Columbus only to have the ocean waves smash them against the iron sides of the ship Passengers and crew attempted to stay afloat in the rough seas by holding onto the rigging of the ship Lighthouse keeper Horiatio N Pease and a complement of Gay Head Wampanoag Indians braved the waves in two lifeboats to save passengers that had held on The sea was so rough that the Indians feared approaching the steamer would cause their own boat to get smashed so they called to the men to dive off the rigging and come to the lifeboats Most of those who attempted this were saved by the Indians

The rescue effort was then continued when the revenue cutter Dexter skippered by Captain Eric Gabrielson came to their aid The Dexter being a smaller ship was able to move about the wreckage and pull survivors off the rigging and masts Two of the survivors were unconscious Second Lieutenant John U Rhodes saved them by tying himself to a rope and swimming to the wreck Even after being hit with a piece of wreckage he continued climbing the rigging to bring the men back to safety The City of Columbus had left Boston with 45 officers and crew and 87 passengers only 17 crew members and 12 passengers survived the ordeal This incident was reported as one of the worst ocean disasters of its time

The shipwreck was later purchased by the Boston Towboat Company in 1886 and some parts were salvaged

Automated cash handling
Automated cash handling is the process of dispensing counting and tracking cash in a bank retail check cashing payday loan  advance casino or other business environment through specially designed hardware and software for the purposes of loss prevention theft deterrence and reducing management time for oversight of cash drawer till operations

The hardware consists of one or more of the following devices


In an automated cash handling environment a cashier or teller opens a cash drawer till at the start of shift by dispensing cash from the automated cash handling equipment At the end of the shift the cashier or teller deposits cash into the automated cash handling equipment which counts the cash and deposits it back into the safe A manager sets permissions for each teller or cashier for dispensing and counting cash A few automated cash handling systems allow for networking and remote operation dispensing counting reporting Remote operation of automated cash handling equipment facilitates cost savings and efficiency by centralizing all cashrelated activity to one location that can remotely monitor and control cash operations


There are several different roles Automatic cash handling systems play in an everyday economy With few setbacks these systems do much more than dispense money read checks transfer money through bank accounts etc Automatic cash handling systems are now found in prisons to help inmates relatives transfer money to prisoners This process is done electronically and is much more efficient and faster than previously manual money transfers These systems also help prisoners psyche by dissuading prisoners from committing fraud or stealing money In 1987 automated cash handling systems started to become a favorite among retailers nationwide The effectiveness and quick checkouts by customers encouraged to use debitcredit cards acted as an attractant for customers It would not be long until most businesses had installed automated cash handling systems as way to keep customers satisfied
In states such as Oregon and New Jersey where pumping your own gas is outlawed automated cash handling has played an important role as a crime deterrent and economical sound system Gas attendants now do not have to worry about being burglarized With automated cash systems in place at these gas stations everything is used by computer making transactions faster than ever These systems also allow petroleum companies to save money and ensure a higher level of security

Automated cash systems have been changing the way society operates since becoming popular in the 1980s Banks have evolved the way they operate around these advanced systems Bankers are finding themselves less physically dealing with money rather they are finding themselves more in a sales position than a traditional banker who handles money These automated systems now count most of the money and dispense the proper amount to bankers

Bykivnia graves
The Bykivnia graves  is a National Historic Memorial on the site of the former village of Bykivnia    on the outskirts of Kiev During the Stalinist period in the Soviet Union it was one of the unmarked mass grave sites where the NKVD the Soviet secret police disposed of thousands of executed enemies of the Soviet state

The number of dead bodies buried there is estimated between dozens of thousand to 30000 to 100000 though some estimates place the number as high as 200000

From the early 1920s until late 1940s throughout the Stalinist purges the Soviet government hauled the bodies of tortured and killed political prisoners to the pine forests outside the village of Bykivnia and buried them in a grave that spanned  So far 210 separate mass graves have been identified by Polish and Ukrainian archaeologists working at the site During the Soviet retreat in the early stages of the Operation Barbarossa the Red Army troops levelled the village to the ground The mass grave site was discovered by the Germans along with many other such sites throughout the Soviet Union However following the discovery of the Katyn massacre the burial sites of Bykivnya was no longer part of German propaganda After the Soviet recapture of the area in the course of the Second Battle of Kiev in 1943 the site was yet again classified by the NKVD In the 1950s the village was reconstructed as a suburb of Kiev In the 1970s the Soviet authorities planned to construct a large bus station on the mass grave site but the plan was abandoned

A document attesting to the origins of the Bykovnia victims was found by the Polish migr historians in Nazi German archives after the war Polish researchers estimate that apart from the Soviet victims of the Great Terror the site might be the final resting place of 3435 Polish officers captured by the Red Army during the Soviet invasion of Poland together with Nazi Germany in 1939 most of whom were executed in the spring of 1940 with over 20000 Polish officers and intellectuals in the Katyn massacre However as the Soviet authorities denied responsibility there was no way to confirm that the victims of the Stalinist purges were indeed buried there During the Soviet era the existence of the site was brought up to authorities numerous times with the most famous incident occurring in 1962 The Ukrainian poet Vasyl Symonenko was beaten up by law enforcement agents and died in hospital from kidney failure soon after

It was not until the 1990s that the authorities of independent Ukraine confirmed the burial of thousands of victims there On April 30 1994 a large memorial to the victims of communism was opened in Bykivnia Around the same time archaeological works started with both Ukrainian and Polish scientists taking part In 2001 the government of Viktor Yanukovych proclaimed the will to convert the Bykivnia woods into a State HistoricalMemorial Complex Graves of Bykivnia The plan was brought to life by Viktor Yushchenko on May 17 2006 In a step toward uncovering this part of Ukraines history Viktor Yushchenko became the first Ukrainian president to take part in the annual Day of Remembrance ceremony on May 21 to honor the estimated 100000 people buried in the mass grave on the outskirts of Kiev We must know the truth Why did our nation lose more than 10 million people without a war Yushchenko said during the 2006 event

Since 2006 Polish researchers have found a number of bodies of Poles prisoners killed in spring 1940 during the Katyn massacre Apart from bodies Polish researchers found everyday use things such as a comb on which the owner an unknown Polish officer carved several names such as Franciszek Strzelecki Ludwik Dworak and Szczyrad  this potentially might be referring to Colonel Bronisaw Mikoaj Szczyradowski deputy of commandant of Lwws defense in September 1939 Also a dog tag belonging to Sergeant Jzef Naglik soldier of the Skalat Battalion of the Border Defence Corps was found at the same spot All the names belong to the Ukrainian list of Katyn massacre victims and serve as proof that Bykivnya is connected to the Katyn crime

2006 Catalan regional election
The 2006 Catalan regional election was held on Wednesday 1 November 2006 to elect the 8th Parliament of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia All 135 seats in the Parliament were up for election

The November 2006 Catalan parliament election was an early one the original election date was due for the Fall of 2007 roughly one year after the actual early election took place This was mostly a result of the uneasy and controversial drafting of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia which further expanded the authority of the Catalan Government

The Statute amendment was approved in a referendum on June 18 2006 in which 7324 of voters were in favour of the new Statute 2057 of the votes were against This referendum was noted for its huge abstention only 4885 of the electorate participated in it

Since the 2003 elections a coalition of three leftwing parties Socialists Party of Catalonia PSC Republican Left of Catalonia ERC and Initiative for Catalonia GreensUnited and Alternative Left ICVEUiA had been in power with Pasqual Maragall as President However in May 2006 ERC following internal tensions left the coalition due to its disagreement on the final draft of the Statute of Autonomy which they themselves had partially drafted thus leaving Maragall without a majority and forcing him to call for this early election On June 21 2006 Maragall announced his intention to personally step down at the upcoming election arguably due to the political erosion his government had suffered after an uneasy relationship with ERC

Besides the issue of Catalan nationalism the main issues of the campaign were taxes social security housing and immigration

Unlike the previous 2003 election when Convergence and Union CiU achieved a plurality of seats in the autonomous Parliament but did not get the highest number of votes PSC achieved a narrow lead in votes the discrepancy between votes number and seats being explained by the electoral law in this occasion CiU won the elections both in seats and votes numbers Still those werent enough to have an absolute majority Then after coalition negotiations the PSC ERC and ICVEUiA agreed to renew the threeparty coalition that had been in power which made PSCs leader Jos Montilla President

This election saw a new party CitizensParty of the Citizenry entering the autonomous parliament which has increased the already high diversity of this parliament from five political parties with representation to now six which contrasts with the increasingly bipartisan Spanish and European in general political scenario

The Parliament of Catalonia was the devolved unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Catalonia having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Catalan Statute of Autonomy as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a President of the Government Voting for the Parliament was on the basis of universal suffrage which comprised all nationals over eighteen registered in Catalonia and in full enjoyment of their political rights

The 135 members of the Parliament of Catalonia were elected using the DHondt method and a closed list proportional representation with a threshold of 3 percent of valid voteswhich included blank ballotsbeing applied in each constituency Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution Additionally the use of the DHondt method might result in an effective threshold over three percent depending on the district magnitude Seats were allocated to constituencies corresponding to the provinces of Barcelona Girona Lleida and Tarragona Each constituency was allocated a fixed number of seats 85 for Barcelona 17 for Girona 15 for Lleida and 18 for Tarragona

The electoral law provided that parties federations coalitions and groupings of electors were allowed to present lists of candidates However groupings of electors were required to secure the signature of at least 1 percent of the electors registered in the constituency for which they sought election Electors were barred from signing for more than one list of candidates Concurrently parties and federations intending to enter in coalition to take part jointly at an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election being called

The term of the Parliament of Catalonia expired four years after the date of its previous election unless it was dissolved earlier The President of the Government was required to call an election fifteen days prior to the date of expiry of parliament with election day taking place within from forty to sixty days after the call The previous election was held on 16 November 2003 which meant that the legislatures term would have expired on 16 November 2007 The election was required to be called no later than 1 November 2007 with it taking place up to the sixtieth day from the call setting the latest possible election date for the Parliament on Monday 31 December 2007

The President of the Government had the prerogative to dissolve the Parliament of Catalonia and call a snap election provided that no motion of no confidence was in process and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since a previous one under this procedure In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional President within a twomonth period from the first ballot the Parliament was to be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called

I Rivers is the pen name of an anonymous Singaporeborn Malaysian author whose first novel Black Magic Woman  Zero Point Negro was published in 2004 by Fugue State Press

Although biographical details are scant an article by Thor Kah Hoong states that Rivers actual first name is Joe and that he studied economics in the United States in the early 1990s he may be presumed to have been born around 1970 He is married and is the father of one child

His first novel was described by Arnold Skemer of ZYX Magazine as follows Certainly hallucinatory and oft breaking into song this novel goes in many directions with names of characters from the realm of fantasy such as Mother Mary Wild Flowers Fire Worm with verbiage of popular music sprinkled in Word play is rampant Greek choruses of extravagant supplications summonings of imagery evocations Q  A of acute tension The reader wanders on a sea of rhetoric drifting into ever more colorful tempests of verbal fantasy In this sea of verbiage the next plot twist is the next verbal conundrum and spasm of preachment the next dollop of mad invocation It goes on from page to page a neverending kaleidoscope of story in labyrinths of twists and turns of utterance In the background is the mad laughter of the funhouse in the foreground the strange declamations of disembodied voices that take center stage then rapidly disappear into the variegated swarm of verbal encounter

Jersey Shore Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway
The Jersey Shore Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway was a railroad built in the early 1880s to give the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad access to the coal regions around Clearfield Pennsylvania United States It was originally planned as part of a connecting line between the East Coast of the United States and Buffalo New York

The railroad was incorporated on February 17 1870 to run from the vicinity of Williamsport to Jersey Shore up Pine Creek and down the Allegheny River to Port Allegany as part of a route to Buffalo
On December 1 1871 Sobieski Ross one of the JSPCBs promoters wrote to George B McClellan extolling the advantages of the route McClellan was then president of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad which shipped petroleum to New York City over the Erie Railway The Eries service was felt to be unsatisfactory and the AGW potentially interested in a new partner The eastern end of the AGW was at Salamanca New York about from Port Allegany along the Allegheny River and could easily be extended along the river to connect with the JSPCB At Newberry near Williamsport traffic could be routed onto the Catawissa Railroad and then the Central Railroad of New Jersey to reach the New York area

Rosss letter gives a good idea of the route planned He says that it would descend on the western side via Mill Creek which meets the Allegheny River at Coudersport The closest approach to the Pine Creek watershed would leave Mill Creek to climb along Nelson Run A summit tunnel long was planned which would suffice to carry a line from the headwaters of Nelson Run into Splash Dam Hollow then down Lyman Run to the West Branch Pine Creek reaching the main stream of Pine Creek at Galeton

Besides the JSPCBs value as a trunk line Ross hopefully anticipated the development of traffic along the line from lumbering coal mining and iron manufacturing In the end only lumbering and tanning would play a significant role in the industry of the area The coal beds along the Allegheny River west of Coudersport were proclaimed worthless by the State Geological Survey in 1885 nor could the local iron ore deposits be economically worked

While grading of the JSPCB began on June 12 1873 the Panic of 1873 soon brought a halt to construction The unfinished line appeared in other grandiose rail schemes the Gaines and State Line Rail Road incorporated 1875 would have built north from the JSPCB at Gaines as part of a line to Hornellsville and Geneva New York

During the early 1880s the New York Central Railroad NYC and a consortium of coal companies from Tioga County Pennsylvania and New York State embarked upon a bold venture The coal companies were plagued by labor disputes and the deposits they mined were diminishing The NYC feared that its rival the Pennsylvania Railroad would use its control over coal shipments from central Pennsylvania to inflate the price of that fuel The solution decided upon was that the coal companies backed by the NYC would build a new rail line into the Clearfield Coalfield and open new mines there Coal would move north over the new line to the NYC The JSPCB would be a key link in the new extension It would also link the NYC to its ally the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad via the latters Catawissa Railroad subsidiary at Newberry

Gaining control of the JSPCB the NYC exploited a provision of the railroads charter allowing for branches of up to thirty miles in any county traversed by the main line The new connection would leave the Corning Cowanesque and Antrim Railroad at Stokesdale Junction near Wellsboro and follow Marsh Creek to Pine Creek and the original route at Ansonia and then pass downstream to Jersey Shore and the Reading connection at Newberry

The remainder of the grading was sold off and in fact was the first part of the route to operate the Coudersport and Port Allegany Railroad opened on the old grade between the two towns in its name in 1882 The JSPCB continued construction on the route from Newberry to Stokesdale Junction which ran through the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania below Ansonia The new line began regular service on June 4 1883 and was opened over its whole length on July 1 1883 However the New York Central did not choose to operate the JSPCB directly On December18 1882 it was leased to the Fall Brook Coal Company from the date of completion officially June 30 1883 for twenty years The companys name was changed to the Pine Creek Railway on February 6 1884

Most of the rest of the planned route between Ansonia and Coudersport saw track laid by the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad and dependent logging lines However it was not connected so as to form a through route and the summit tunnel was never built

As the Pine Creek Railway the new line formed an important part of the Fall Brooks system The Fall Brook already leased the Corning Cowanesque  Antrim and a series of NYCcontrolled lines in New York giving it a continuous line from Tioga County to the NYC main line at Lyons New York On July 1 1892 the Fall Brook Coal Company separated its railroad and coal interests transferring the Pine Creek Ry lease to the new Fall Brook Railway However the independent operation of these lines by the Fall Brook was not to last In 1895 the NYC began to investigate buying out the Fall Brook which now formed a vital link between the New York Central main line and the NYCcontrolled Beech Creek Railroad at Jersey Shore The NYC ultimately succeeded in buying up the Fall Brook Railway and took over the Pine Creek Railway lease on May 1 1899 On February 4 1909 the Pine Creek was merged with other elements of the former Fall Brook system to form the Geneva Corning and Southern Railroad which in turn was merged into the New York Central on December 22 1914

After the 1899 takeover the former Fall Brook lines were operated by the NYC as the Fall Brook District Pennsylvania Division The Pine Creek line was one of those taken over by Conrail in 1976 but the last train ran on the route on October 7 1988 After the removal of the tracks the rightofway was converted to the Pine Creek Rail Trail

<doc id="7727938" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7727938" title="Mexican Train">
Mexican Train
Mexican Train is a game played with number dominoes The object of the game is for a player to play all the dominoes from his or her hand onto one or more chains or trains emanating from a central hub or station The games most popular name comes from a special optional train that belongs to all players However the game can be played without the Mexican Train such variants are generally called Private Trains or Domino Trains It is related to the game Chicken Foot

A doubletwelve set of dominoes is marketed as the standard for Mexican Train and accommodates up to 8 players Other sets are commonly used as well The following alternate sets are common depending on the number of people playing

In addition to dominoes the game also requires

Many sets of dominoes include a station and special trainshaped tokens for markers and packaged games with a central station and custom tokens are available However the station piece is not strictly needed and anything from coins to poker chips to even pieces of candy or slips of paper can be used as markers

The object of all Trains games is to be the first player to place all of their dominoes Dominoes may be placed onto the players train onto the Mexican train if available or on the trains of other players under special circumstances The middle tile counts as the start of a players multiple tile train

At the start of each round the dominoes are placed face side down shuffled and drawn by players to form their hands Using the doublenine set 
players draw dominoes as follows

Any remaining dominoes are placed to one side forming the boneyard

With a standard doubletwelve set the double twelve is placed in the station In each successive round the next lower double is used until all doubles are used The doubleblank is the final round

Play continues to the left Each person lays one legally placed domino per turn or two if the players first domino is a double If they are unable to they must draw a domino from the boneyard If they are able to lay that domino they must do so immediately Otherwise their turn is over and play continues to the left each player trying to place all their dominoes by playing matching dominoes one at a time end to end

A train can be as long as the players can make it it only ends when all dominoes that could match its endpoint have already been played As a result trains can become quite long especially with an extended domino set It is acceptable to bend the train 90 or 180 to keep the train on the playing surface as long as it does not interfere with the endpoints of other trains

All trains begin the game as public and all players may play on them When a player plays a domino on their train it then becomes private When a player draws a domino and is unable to play it they must mark their train as public by placing a marker on their train If a player is deemed to have made a strategic error the highest score of that round is added to theirs

Players have the option whether they can play on their own train or not of playing a domino on any train currently marked public When a player with a public train adds a domino to it it becomes private again and may not be played on except by the trains owner

The Mexican Train is an additional train that anyone may play on during their turn They can start the train by playing a domino matching the engine ie the double played at the beginning of the round or add to the train Mexican trains can be added as long as a space remains

When a double is played it is placed perpendicular to the train Subsequently adding a domino to the double is called finishing satisfying the double or covering the double

The player who played the double must take another turn This additional turn follows exactly the same rules as any normal turn They may play anywhere they like and do not have to finish the double on this turn They may play elsewhere and provided they make a legal play do not have to mark their train for not finishing the double unless the double was played on their own train Blanks are wild Like any other turn if they cannot play they must draw a domino and mark their train as public

If a double remains unfinished after it has been played the train becomes a public train No other train can be added to by any player until someone finishes the double Play passes to the next player who can legally play on this train if the train is theirs or if they can legally play on public trains If they cannot finish the double they must draw a domino and if they cannot play it on the double their own train becomes public Play continues like this until someone finishes the double Single and double blanks are considered wilds

Branching on doubles as in Chicken Foot is allowed as an option see Variations below

At the end of each round the player going out receives 0 points while all other players receive the sum of all pips dots on their dominoes The person with the fewest points after all thirteen rounds have been played is the winner In the case of a tie the person with the most 0point rounds is the winner If this is still a tie the person with the lowest round total other than 0 is the winner

With four six or eight players the game can be played in teams of two with partners sitting opposite each other Rules are identical except that a players train and their partners train are considered one and the same they will usually extend from opposite sides of the station and thus a player can play on their own end or their partners and neither end becomes public until neither partner can play a tile Scoring is also handled in pairs with the player who went out scoring zero for their team even though their partner will have dominoes remaining and other teams summing their scores for a team score


There are a number of other versions of the rules for Mexican Train varying the number of dominoes drawn by each player the rules for playing doubles or the number of tiles that can be played during one turn For example

Fast Game variation After the starting double has been placed turns are ignored and each player focuses on making their own train as long as possible Once everyone has made as long of a train as they can play reverts to turns using the rules listed above This speeds up the game but eliminates some of the strategies of playing doubles

Delayed First Turn variation Similar to the Fast Game variation listed above instead of simultaneously each person takes turns playing as many dominoes on their train as possible Any player that is unable to play on their first turn draws a domino and may then begin their first turn or pass When a player who has passed finally starts their train they may play as many dominoes as they can string together After starting their train players are only permitted to play one domino at a time as usual unless playing a double This version allows a player to save their first turn string of dominoes for when they have a chance instead of being stuck with all dominoes from the beginning

Branching Doubles variation Once a double has been satisfied players may continue to branch off of the double in two more directions meaning the double will have a matching endpoint on all four sides Often players like to angle these branches at a 45degree angle to accommodate for more room This variant gives players more choice and speeds up the game

Swan Drive variation A player who can play on their own train may also play one tile on each subsequent public train in clockwise order Each public train must be played on in order to continue in this manner and only one tile per train may be played unless a double must be finished Once a player cannot play on the next public train or has looped around to their own train their turn ends While playing on each public train the player may choose to play on the Mexican train or skip it when he comes to it making the placement of the train somewhat strategical This version makes for a much faster game

York Mystery Plays
The York Mystery Plays more properly the York Corpus Christi Plays are a Middle English cycle of 48 mystery plays or pageants covering sacred history from the creation to the Last Judgment They were traditionally presented on the feast day of Corpus Christi a movable feast on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday between 23 May and 24 June and were performed in the city of York from the midfourteenth century until their suppression in 1569 The plays are one of four virtually complete surviving English mystery play cycles along with the Chester Mystery Plays the TowneleyWakefield plays and the NTown plays Two long composite and late mystery pageants have survived from the Coventry cycle and there are records and fragments from other similar productions that took place elsewhere A manuscript of the plays probably dating from between 1463 and 1477 is still intact and stored at the British Library

There is no record of the first performance of the mystery plays but they were recorded as celebrating the festival of Corpus Christi in York in 1376 by which time the use of pageant wagons had already been established The plays were organised financed and performed by the York Craft Guilds Mystery is a play on words representing a religious truth or rite and its Middle English meaning of a trade or craft The wagons were paraded through the streets of York stopping at 12 playing stations designated by the city banners

The cycle uses many different verse forms most have rhyme a regular rhythm with fairly short lines and frequent alliteration The balance of critical opinion is in favour of several clerics being responsible for their authorship one of whom is conventionally known as the York Realist It comprises 48 pageants that were originally presented on carts and wagons dressed for the occasion In some accounts there are as many as 56 pageants They told stories from the Old and New Testaments from the Creation to the Last Judgement The plays continued after the Reformation when in 1548 the feast of Corpus Christi was abolished in England The plays were accommodated in to the new religious orthodoxy by cutting scenes honouring the Virgin but were suppressed in 1569

Traditionally an individual guild took responsibility for a particular play

The authorship of the plays is unknown but analysis of the style allows scholars to recognise where authorship changes One group of plays concerned with the Passion has been attributed to a writer called The York Realist and the name has come into general use The eight plays concerned are
They are all written in vigorous alliterative verse as are other plays in the cycle The distinctive feature apart from the high quality of the writing is the attention to incidental detail in the storytelling and in the subtle portrayal of the negative characters Pilate Herod Annas and Caiaphas Playwright Peter Gill expressed the view that If it hadnt been for the York Realist Shakespeare would have been a second rate writer like Goethe

After their suppression in Tudor times the plays remained little known until Lucy Toulmin Smith obtained permission from the Earl of Ashburnham to study the manuscript of the plays in his possession and publish her transcription together with an introduction and short glossary in 1885

In 1909 the York Historic Pageant included a parade of guild banners accompanying a wagon representing the Nativity through the streets In December the same year a selection of six plays was performed as a fundraising venture for St Olaves Church York The play cycle was revived on a much larger scale in 1951 in the York Festival of the Arts part of the Festival of Britain celebrations It was performed on a fixed stage in the ruins of St Marys Abbey in the Museum Gardens and directed by E Martin Browne The music written for the occasion by James Brown was directed by Allan Wicks The part of Jesus was played by Joseph OConor although to preserve mystique he was not named in the programme and other roles were taken by amateurs In the interests of comprehensibility the text was abbreviated and modernised by Canon Purvis who went on to lead the Borthwick Institute at the University of York and produced a modernisation of the complete text

Following the success of the 1951 production said to be the most widely applauded festival event in the country with over 26000 people witnessing the Plays selections from the cycle were staged in the same location at threeyear intervals lengthening to fouryear intervals until 1988 They have aroused academic interest and publications Usually directed by a professional and with a professional actor playing Jesus the rest of the cast were local amateurs Ian McShane played LuciferSatan in 1963 Some amateur actors such as Judi Dench became professionals Directors included E Martin Browne again 1954 1957 1966 David Giles 1960 William Gaskill 1963 Edward Taylor 1969 1973 Jane Howell 1976 Patrick Garland 1980 Toby Robertson 1984 and Steven Pimlott 1988
The role of Jesus was played a second time by Joseph OConor 1954 then by Brian Spink 1957 Tom Criddle 1960 Alan Dobie 1963 John Westbrook 1966 John Stuart Anderson 1973 local York man David Bradley 1976 Christopher Timothy 1980 Simon Ward 1984 and Victor Banerjee 1988

In 1992 the production was moved in a modern production to the York Theatre Royal with Robson Green playing Christ and a script adapted by Liz Lochhead The 1996 production in the same place was allamateur with the part of Jesus played by local solicitor Rory Mulvihill and the script shortened by Lochhead For 2000 the interest of the Dean of York Very Rev Raymond Furnell led him to offer the use of York Minster for the most ambitious production so far

In 2000 a largescale performance was staged in York Minster as The York Millennium Mystery Plays Directed by Gregory Doran with a script adapted by Mike Poulton and with Ray Stevenson in the role of Christ the production was the most expensive and widereaching project in the history of the plays modern revival The first half began in heaven with the story of the fall of Lucifer followed by the creation of the world the fall of Adam and Eve Noahs Ark with impressive and memorable representations of the animals and the flood and the story of Abraham and Isaac From the New Testament there came the annunciation and nativity of Jesus the massacre of the innocents Christs childhood baptism temptation and ministry and his entrance into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday The second half concentrated on the capture and trial of Christ and his crucifixion resurrection and ascension The production ended as is traditional with the Last Judgement

The production ran for a month with a total audience of 28000 Aside from the professional director and actor Ray Stevenson the cast was made up of amateurs mainly from the York area More than fifty children also took part Original music was written for the production by local composer Richard Shephard

For 2012 the Mystery plays returned to the Museum Gardens their home until 1988 The script was adapted by Mike Kenny and direction was by Damian Cruden of York Theatre Royal and Paul Burbridge of Riding Lights Theatre Company The show involved more than 1000 local volunteers working alongside theatre professionals in all areas of the production including 500 amateur actors organised into two casts who shared the 30performance run The combined role of Jesus and God the Father was played by Ferdinand Kingsley and LuciferSatan by Graeme Hawley Reviews for the production were generally positive with praise for the spectacle and stage design as well as the efforts of the volunteers

In 2016 the plays were performed in York Minster from 26 May the feast of Corpus Christi until 30 June The director Phillip Breen had previously directed for the Royal Shakespeare Company Writer Mike Poulton and composer Richard Shepard repeated their millennium production roles The cast had about 150 amateur actors and the sole professional Philip McGinley played Jesus except for the last four performances when owing to his sudden illness the role was taken by his understudy Toby Gordon

An experimental production using horsedrawn brewers drays and market stalls was performed around Leeds University in 1975

In 1994 the Leedsbased historian Jane Oakshott worked alongside the Friends of York Mystery Plays the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of York and the York Early Music Festival to direct the first processional performance of the plays in modern times in York The production involved nine amateur drama groups each taking one plays and touring it to five playing stations in central York using pageant waggons

A production in similar format in 1998 featured eleven plays and for the first time the modern York Guilds were involved with some of the plays either directly or as sponsors

Following the production in York Minster in 2000 the Waggon Plays were the only regular cycle performed in the city until 2012 when the static plays were revived The Waggon Plays also used the Museum Gardens as a performance station maintaining the link between St Marys Abbey and the plays established in the 1950s

For the 2002 production management transferred to a committee of the Guilds of York the York Guild of Building the Company of Merchant Taylors the Company of Cordwainers the Gild of Freemen the Company of Butchers the Guild of Scriveners and the Company of Merchant Adventurers Ten plays were produced with the assistance of local drama groups

In 2006 twelve waggons performed in the streets in conjunction with the York Early Music Festival

The 2010 production featured twelve waggons performing at four stations At the same time the only known surviving manuscript of the plays was displayed in York Art Gallery

Two plays Creation and Noahs Ark were performed on waggons at two stations in the York 800 celebrations in 2012

The performances on waggons were performed by the Guilds in 2014 continuing the established fouryearly cycle 2018 will see the plays return to the streets of York with a selection of 11 plays

Modern performances use some degree of modernisation of the text either by a radical policy of replacing all obsolete word and phrases by modern equivalents or at least by using modern pronunciations An exception is the productions of the Lords of Misrule a dramatic group composed of students and recent graduates of the Department of Medieval Studies at the University of York Their presentations use authentic Middle English both in the words used and in their pronunciation They have regularly contributed to one of the waggon play productions

Anatoli Bugorski
Anatoli Petrovich Bugorski  born 25 June 1942 is a Russian scientist who was struck by a particle accelerator beam in 1978

As a researcher at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Protvino Bugorski worked with the largest Soviet particle accelerator the U70 synchrotron On 13 July 1978 Bugorski was checking a malfunctioning piece of equipment when the safety mechanisms failed Bugorski was leaning over the equipment when he stuck his head in the path of the 76 GeV proton beam Reportedly he saw a flash brighter than a thousand suns but did not feel any pain

The left half of Bugorskis face swelled up beyond recognition and over the next several days the skin started to peel revealing the path that the proton beam moving near the speed of light had burned through parts of his face his bone and the brain tissue underneath As it was believed that he had received far in excess of a fatal dose of radiation Bugorski was taken to a clinic in Moscow where the doctors could observe his expected demise However Bugorski survived and even completed his PhD There was virtually no damage to his intellectual capacity but the fatigue of mental work increased markedly Bugorski completely lost hearing in the left ear replaced by a form of tinnitus The left half of his face was paralyzed due to the destruction of nerves He was able to function well except for the fact that he had occasional complex partial seizures and rare tonicclonic seizures

Bugorski continued to work in science and held the post of coordinator of physics experiments Because of the Soviet Unions policy of maintaining secrecy on nuclear powerrelated issues Bugorski did not speak about the accident for over a decade He continued going to the Moscow radiation clinic twice a year for examinations and to meet with other nuclearaccident victims He was described as a poster boy for Soviet and Russian radiation medicine In 1996 he applied unsuccessfully for disabled status to receive free epilepsy medication Bugorski showed interest in making himself available for study to Western researchers but could not afford to leave Protvino
Bugorski is married to Vera Nikolaevna and they had a son Peter

Eugendus
Saint Eugendus also Augendus  449  January 1 510 was the fourth abbot of Condat Abbey at SaintClaude Jura He was born at Izernore

He was instructed in reading and writing by his father who had become a priest and at the age of seven was given to Saint Romanus and Saint Lupicinus to be educated at Condat Abbey Thenceforth he never left the monastery Eugendus acquired much learning read the Greek and Latin authors and was well versed in the Scriptures He led a life of great austerity including being said to have never laughed supposedly in respect to a passage in the Rule of St Benedict not to take pleasure in unrestrained or raucous laughter despite the fact that St Benedict was born thirty years after him and would scarcely have been known at the time of Eugendus death He also refused ever to be ordained a priest 

Abbot Minausius made him his coadjutor and after the formers death about 496 Eugendus became his successor After the monastery which Saint Romanus had built of wood was destroyed by fire Eugendus erected another of stone and improved the community life thus far the brethren had lived in separate cells after the fashion of the Eastern ascetics He built an abbey church in honour of the holy Apostles Peter Paul and Andrew and enriched it with precious relics the church was the predecessor of the rebuilt abbey church that is now SaintClaude Cathedral

The order which had been founded on the rules of the Oriental monasteries now took on more of the active character of the Western brethren the rule of Tarnate is thought to have served as a model Condat began to flourish as a place of refuge for all those who suffered from the misfortunes and afflictions of those eventful times a school of virtue and knowledge amid the surrounding darkness an oasis in the desert When Eugendus felt his end approaching he had his breast anointed by a priest took leave of his brethren and died quietly after five days at the age of sixtyone

A few years after his death his successor Saint Viventiolus erected a shrine over his tomb in the abbey church to which numerous pilgrims travelled The village that grew round Condat Abbey came to be called after the saint SaintOyand de Joux a name it retained as late as the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries while the abbeys former name of Condat passed into oblivion the abbey was secularised in 1742

The feast of Saint Eugendus was at first transferred to 2 January in the dioceses of Besanon and SaintClaude it is now celebrated on 4 January

<doc id="7728139" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7728139" title="Naive T cell">
Naive T cell
A naive T cell T0 cell is a T cell that has differentiated in bone marrow and successfully undergone the positive and negative processes of central selection in the thymus Among these are the naive forms of helper T cells CD4 and cytotoxic T cells CD8 A naive T cell is considered mature and unlike activated or memory T cells has not encountered its cognate antigen within the periphery

Naive T cells are commonly characterized by the surface expression of Lselectin CD62L and CC Chemokine receptor type 7 CCR7 the absence of the activation markers CD25 CD44 or CD69 and the absence of memory CD45RO isoform They also express functional IL7 receptors consisting of subunits IL7 receptor CD127 and common chain CD132 In the naive state T cells are thought to require the commongamma chain cytokines IL7 and IL15 for homeostatic survival mechanisms While naive T cells are regularly regarded as a developmentally synchronized and fairly homogeneous and quiescent cell population only differing in T cell receptor specificity there is increasing evidence that naive T cells are actually heterogeneous in phenotype function dynamics and differentiation status resulting in a whole spectrum of naive cells with different properties For instance some nonnaive T cells express surface markers similar to naive T cells Tscm stem cell memory T cells Tmp memory T cells with a naive phenotype some antigennaive T cells have lost their naive phenotype and some T cells are incorporated within the naive T cell phenotype but are a different T cell subset Treg regulatory T cells RTE Recent Thymic emigrant It is important to appreciate these differences when assessing naive T cells Majority of human naive T cells are produced very early in life when infants thymus is large and functional Decrease in naive T cell production due to involution of the thymus with age is compensated by so called peripheral proliferation or homeostatic proliferation of naive T cells which have emigrated from the thymus earlier in life The homeostatic proliferation causes change to naive T cell gene expression and ie is manifested by acquisition of CD25 surface protein expression

Naive T cells can respond to novel pathogens that the immune system has not yet encountered Recognition by a naive T cell clone of its cognate antigen results in the initiation of an immune response In turn this results in the T cell acquiring an activated phenotype seen by the upregulation of surface markers CD25 CD44 CD62L CD69 and may further differentiate into a memory T cell

Having adequate numbers of naive T cells is essential for the immune system to continuously respond to unfamiliar pathogens

When a recognized antigen binds to the T cell antigen receptor TCR located in the cell membrane of Th0 cells these cells are activated through the following classical signal transduction cascade

An alternative nonclassical pathway involves activated Zap70 directly phosphorylating the p38 MAPK that in turn induces the expression of the vitamin D receptor VDR Furthermore the expression of PLC1 is dependent on VDR activated by calcitriol Naive T cells have very low expression of VDR and PLC1 However activated TCR signaling through p38 upregulates VDR expression and calcitriol activated VDR in turn upregulates PLC1 expression Hence the activation of naive T cells is crucially dependent on adequate calcitriol levels

In summary activation of T cells first requires activation through the nonclassical pathway to increase expression of VDR and PLC1 before activation through the classical pathway can proceed This provides a delayed response mechanism where the innate immune system is allowed time 48 hrs to clear an infection before the inflammatory T cell mediated adaptive immune response kicks in

He eventually returned to Nigeria to become the Editor in Chief of the Daily Times of Nigeria and he was subsequently appointed to its board as the Executive Director of Manpower and Development He retired from newspaper journalism in 1994 as the Executive Director of Publications Ugochukwu remained active as a media consultant for the Dow Jones Financial News Service Throughout his distinguished career as a journalist Ugochukwu has met and interviewed numerous Heads of States  including then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
South African President Nelson Mandela Jamaican Prime Minister P J Patterson French President Jacques Chirac Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Cuban President Fidel Castro Nigerian presidents Ibrahim Babangida Muhammadu Buhari Sani Abacha and Abdusalami Abubakar  and presented papers on African economic and political development at various forums including Oxford University England and Uppsala University

With Nigerias return to democracy in 1998 Ugochukwu became the Director of Publicity at the Obasanjo for President Campaign Organisation and contributed immensely to the election of Olusegun Obasanjo as the President of Nigeria Ugochukwu was appointed as the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Orientation and Public Affairs He spearheaded a National Rebirth campaign aimed at instilling patriotic virtues into a national psyche ravaged by years of political instability and corruption It was on this platform that Ugochukwu launched The Nigerian Declaration of Human Responsibilities which declares in part This Character on Human Responsibilities Seeks to bring freedom and responsibility into a better balance to highlight and increase awareness of the obligation which we owe each other and to our nation

To soothe the political unrest in the oilrich Niger Delta region of southern Nigeria President Obasanjo signed the Niger Delta Development Commission NDDC act of 2000 into law Ugochukwu was appointed as the pioneer chairman of the newly created commission charged with developing the nine oil producing states of the country with excess oil revenues

Ugochukwu helped to articulate the presidents vision of sustainable development in the Niger Delta region and developed a policy which encouraged partnership amongst its stakeholdersNigerdelta communities and their tribal chiefs youth militia oil companies and their executives the Nigerian government and NonGovernment Organizations and international organisations like the United Nations Development Programme UNDP and the World Bank During Ugochukwus tenure the NDDC focused mainly on economic revival and prosperity environmental rehabilitation and the development of social and physical infrastructure

At the end of his fouryear tenure at NDDC Ugochukwu returned to Abuja and continued to serve as the Presidents Special Adviser on Communications He took an interest in state politics and resigned from office to join the Abia State gubernatorial race In 2006 the Campaign for Abia Rebirth CARE was launched with a promise to rebuild the state On 13 December 2006 Ugochukwu emerged as the Peoples Democratic Party PDP candidate for the 2007 Abia State gubernatorial elections The hotly contested race was marred by allegations of electoral malpractice and violence all of which culminated in the election of Ugochukwus rival Theodore Orji of the Progressive Peoples Alliance PPA

There was an attempt on Ugochukwus life during the Abia State Gubernatorial elections on 14 April 2007 The assailants fired shots at his motorcade fatally wounding one of his State Security Service SSS bodyguards who suffered gunshot wounds through his head and hands Ugochukwu the PDP candidate and frontrunner in the election blamed the attack on his political opponents in the All Nigeria Peoples Party ANPP and Progressive Peoples Alliance PPA

Ugochukwu sought redress at the Abia State Election Petition Tribunal Governor Theodore Orjis election was annulled on 25 February 2008 on the grounds that he was ineligible to contest for the office Orji and his deputy had failed to resign their respective positions in the Abia State government 30 days prior to the election as stipulated in the 1999 Constitution The Tribunal also cited Governor Orjis failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his affiliation with a secret cult

Ugochukwu was thus declared the lawful winner of the April 2007 gubernatorial election and Governorelect of Abia State  pending the outcome at the Port Harcourt Appeals Court
However on 11 February 2009 an appeal court in Port Harcourt overturned the ruling declaring that Theodore Orji of the PPA had in fact won the election

Ad hoc testing
Ad hoc testing is a commonly used term for software testing performed without planning and documentation but can be applied to early scientific experimental studies

The tests are intended to be run only once unless a defect is discovered Ad hoc testing is the least formal test method As such it has been criticized because it is not structured and hence defects found using this method may be harder to reproduce since there are no written test cases However the strength of ad hoc testing is that important defects can be found quickly

It is performed by improvisation the tester seeks to find bugs by any means that seem appropriate Ad hoc testing can be seen as a light version of error guessing which itself is a light version of exploratory testing

Tock
Tock also known as Tuck in some English parts of Quebec is a board game similar to Ludo Aggravation or Sorry in which players race their four tokens or marbles around the game board from start to finishthe objective being to be the first to take all of ones tokens home Like Sorry it is played with playing cards rather than dice

Tock is a Cross and Circle game in the style of Pachisi an Indian game played since the first millennium BC Tocks exact origins are unclear but traditionally it is believed that it originated with the early settlers of Quebec Canada

From Quebec the game Jeu du Toc Tock moved to France where it is also known as Jeu des petits chevaux canadiens Tock is also similar to the French game Jeu des petits chevaux where moves are determined by throwing dice instead of playing cards

Some versions of the game use pawns or men as tokens other versions use marbles instead which advance on a wooden board with circular indentations in it to hold the marbles While the game is designed on the basis of a French deck of cards with jokers removed there are some versions that do use the jokers 54Cards Game or that come with cards specially made for the game that depict the actions they allow

At the beginning of each round players are dealt a number of cards which they play in turns to move their tokens around the board If at any time a token lands exactly on the field occupied by another token then the moved token replaces the resting one which is placed back into the corresponding players starting area If a player on his turn has no cards he can play with his tokens or which he cant play against the other players like a 5 10 or Queen in some variations then he must discard his entire remaining hand and wait for the next hand to be dealt

A starter is a card that allows a player to move a new token to the starting field Aces and Kings and Jokers in some variations are starters

A token at the starting field is immune to capture or swaping by an opponent and additionally it creates a blockade No players can pass a token that is on its starting field either forward or backwards with a 4with the exception of a Joker

In the simplest form of the game the cards only provide a single specific number of fields to move forward However Tock has many even more popular variations where some cards have special functions that make the game more challenging and interesting

Any combination of card functions can be used in play Just ensure every player is aware of all the options to be used in play prior to the game



Aside from a Free for all play style the game also supports a variety of team based modes Common to all team based variations is that once a team member has managed to bring all of his tokens home he helps move his partners tokens If the first player to get all marbles home plays a seven the remainder can be used to move the partners marbles Also after every hand is dealt the team members exchange one card with each other

William Montgomery Brown
William Montgomery Brown 18551937 sometimes called Bad Bishop Brown was an Episcopal clergyman and author Brown of Galion Ohio was consecrated a bishop of the Episcopal Church but is best remembered as the first Episcopal bishop to be tried for heresy since the Reformation and the first of any creed in America to be deposed for heretical teachings He later became a bishop in the Old Catholic Church

William Montgomery Brown was born on September 4 1855 on a farm west of Orrville Ohio the son of a Joseph Morrison and Lucina Elzina Cary Brown His father was a tenant farmer who moved the family to Michigan in 1858 and later enlisted in the Union Army during the Civil War Joseph Brown served in Tennessee before becoming ill and was sent home to recuperate He died on August 1 1862 His mother moved the family back to Ohio and Willy was hired out to a farmer who did not treat the boy well and neglected to provide for his education

When Willy was 15 the county placed him with a farmer named Jacob Gardner a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church Gardners piety greatly influenced young Brown During this time he became seriously ill with typhoid fever Years later Brown recalled making a bargain with God to devote his life to the ministry if his life would be spared His health improved and he saved enough from the money his foster parents paid him to leave Ohio just after his 21st birthday In 1876 Brown traveled to Omaha Nebraska and got a job driving a carriage for a judge who arranged for Brown to enter public school After graduating Brown returned to Ohio and worked in a tannery

Philanthropist Mary Scranton Bradford agreed to underwrite his education at the Episcopal Seminary Bexley Hall at Kenyon College in Gambier Ohio Mrs Bradford sent him to Seabury Divinity School in Minnesota from 1879 to 1880 so he could prepare for the seminary course He finished his studies in 1883 but because he did not take all of his courses at Kenyon he never received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Bexley Brown was ordained and in 1883 became vicar of Grace Church in Galion Ohio In 1891 he became the archbishop for missionary work in the Diocese of Ohio and wrote his popular The Church for Americans which explained the beliefs of the Episcopal Church This placed him in the national spotlight He was consecrated assistant bishop of Arkansas in 1898 and succeeded to the bishopric after the death of Henry Niles Pierce Also in 1898 he received an honorary Doctor of Divinity from Kenyon College

His 1907 book The Crucial Race Question which supported the segregation of the races greatly angered the Northerners who usually contributed substantial sums to support his poor diocese Brown created the Helen Dunlap School for Mountain Girls and a seminary to train a local ministry in Arkansas From 1909 to 1910 he engaged in a sharp conflict with Trinity Cathedral in Little Rock Pulaski County over the issue of control over the cathedral and the refusal of the dean to read and compliment the bishops new book The Level Plan of Church Union This dispute further alienated many in Arkansas The Level Plan rejected many practices of the Episcopal Church and angered many supporters who promptly insisted that he leave In 1911 he returned to Galion Ohio and formally resigned as bishop of Arkansas in 1912 although he remained a bishop without a diocese He was succeeded as Bishop of Arkansas by James Rideout Winchester

Brown began reading Charles Darwin Karl Marx and other authors promoting a materialistic view of the world Two years later Brown announced his conversion to science in July 1913 He wrote to Episcopal bishops informing them of his new position He rejected the historical Jesus I no longer believed in a personal God nor in a sixday creation nor in a literal heaven and hell Brown wrote Creeds he decided were merely symbolical

Browns evolution from Bishop of Arkansas 18991912 to finding an interest in Marxism socialism and Communism during the 1910s to author of Communism and Christianism 1920 dramatically increased and challenged his influence in the church It led to his heresy trial by the House of Bishops in 192425 There he tried to prove to his fellow bishops that they did not believe in a strict interpretation of the Bible any more than he then did Nonetheless Brown was deposed and excommunicated However while awaiting the final verdict on his deposition as bishop in October 1925 he was offered a place in both the Russian Orthodox Church which was heavily influenced by Soviet authorities at the time and the Old Catholic Church He opted for the latter and was consecrated an Old Catholic bishop in a ceremony conducted in his own study in Galion Because Old Catholic orders were accepted as valid by the Episcopal Church in the United States Bishop Browns position as a bishop in apostolic succession could not be challenged by his former church Many Old Catholic churches count Bishop Brown in the line of succession of their bishops

Brown felt that his real ministry began at age 71 when he started lecturing to the working class and writing a wider variety of books When he encountered difficulty in finding a publisher he published himself under the Bradford Brown Educational Company Inc He continued to write until his death in 1937 at the age of 82 Bishop Brown is buried beside his wife in Galions Fairview Cemetery His will left bequests to the Galion hospital and to Kenyon College


In December 1882 William Brown married Ella Scranton Bradford adopted niece of Mary Scranton Bradford Mrs Bradford had Brownella Cottage built across the street from Grace Church as a wedding present for the couple A brick structure from 1866 that had originally been used as St Joseph Roman Catholic Church was preserved on the site to serve as Williams study Brownella Cottage was completed in 1887 The house reflected both the Bradford wealth and the high style of 1880s architecture in the United States Ella Brown died in 1935 the bishop on October 31 1937

Brownella Cottage is owned by the Galion Historical Society which operates it as part monument to Brown part museum for the town of Galion The ghosts of both Ella and William Brown are purported to haunt Brownella Cottage It has been said that every Halloween night one can see the ghost of the bishop walking the glass causeway between the house and the study One individual taking the guided tour reported smelling pipe smoke even though there were no pipe smokers present The building has had many visitors particularly around Halloween who are drawn to the story of ghosts allegedly inhabiting the building

The My Ghost Story television program ran an episode on Brownella Cottage offering accounts of several people claiming encounters with what they thought may have been a ghost

The Great Snow of 1717
The Great Snow of 1717 was a series of snowstorms between February 27 and March 7 1717 Gregorian calendar that blanketed the colony of Virginia and the New England colonies with five or more feet 15 or more meters of snow and much higher drifts Snowfall may have occurred elsewhere but settler population was sparse outside of New England at that time The Great Snow is considered one of the benchmark storms in New England often compared to the Great Blizzard of 1888 in severity

The winter even prior to the Great Snow had been the worst in memory The temperatures had not been unusually cold but in December 1716 there had already been snow to the depth of  By the end of January there were drifts high in a few places overwhelming the people living in New England at the time

There had been a series of volcanic eruptions circa 1716 Ash circulating the globe in the upper atmosphere from the eruptions of Mount Kirishima in Japan Kelud in Indonesia and Taal Volcano in the Philippines likely contributed to the exceptional New England snowfall

The great snow depending on the source began on February 27 or March 1 On February 27 a typical New England noreaster passed through with snow falling on some areas and other places receiving a mix of snow sleet and rain The first major snowstorm occurred on March 1 with another on the 4th and a third the worst among the three on the 7th At some points the snow would lighten and stop but the sky would remain cloudy showing no signs of clearing

Some of the oldest Native Americans had said that even their ancestors never spoke of a storm of this magnitude Boston received around of snow while some places north of the city reached up to  In Hampton Massachusetts the snow was so deep that people could only leave their houses from the second floor on the lee side of the house implying actual snow depths of as much as or more Many singlestory homes were buried completely without even the chimney showing On the larger residences drifts reached the thirdstory window on the windward side Large expanses of snow were deep with some significant drifts deep

The post roads were impassable until at least March 15 with the mailmen describing snow drifts from Boston to Portsmouth more than a week after the storm Travel was also impossible for a time from New York City to Boston

The geographic scope of the storm is unknown due to the scarce population and poor recordkeeping of the day Most information is known only from private diaries The snow was known to be several feet deep around Philadelphia New York City New London Connecticut Boston and Portsmouth New Hampshire

Many livestock lost their lives either starving or freezing to death under tremendous drifts of snow As many as 9095 of the deer in the area died either from starvation or predators leading to many towns appointing deerreeves to ensure their preservation Many orchards were damaged since the snow covered even the tops of many trees and animals would graze among the upper branches where they usually could not

List of Christian mystics
Christian mysticism refers to the development of mystical practices and theory within Christianity It has often been connected to mystical theology especially in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christianity both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox traditions

The attributes and means by which Christian mysticism is studied and practiced are varied They range from ecstatic visions of the souls mystical union with God to simple prayerful contemplation of Holy Scripture ie Lectio Divina

The experiences of mystics are often framed within theological approaches to God such as Quietism Pietism etc therefore in order to aid in the understanding of Christian mysticism this list includes some philosophers theologians anonymous theological books religious groups and movements whose ideas and practices have had an influence on Christian mystics and the Christian mystical experience

<doc id="7728392" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7728392" title="Entropy order and disorder">
Entropy order and disorder
In thermodynamics entropy is commonly associated with the amount of order disorder or chaos in a thermodynamic system This stems from Rudolf Clausius 1862 assertion that any thermodynamic process always admits to being reduced reduction to the alteration in some way or another of the arrangement of the constituent parts of the working body and that internal work associated with these alterations is quantified energetically by a measure of entropy change according to the following differential expression

In the years to follow Ludwig Boltzmann translated these alterations into that of a probabilistic view of order and disorder in gasphase molecular systems

In recent years in chemistry textbooks there has been a shift away from using the terms order and disorder to that of the concept of energy dispersion to describe entropy among other theories In the 2002 encyclopedia Encarta for example entropy is defined as a thermodynamic property which serves as a measure of how close a system is to equilibrium as well as a measure of the disorder in the system
In the context of entropy perfect internal disorder is synonymous with equilibrium but since that definition is so far different from the usual definition implied in normal speech the use of the term in science has caused a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding

Locally the entropy can be lowered by external action This applies to machines such as a refrigerator where the entropy in the cold chamber is being reduced and to living organisms This local decrease in entropy is however only possible at the expense of an entropy increase in the surroundings

This molecular ordering entropy perspective traces its origins to molecular movement interpretations developed by Rudolf Clausius in the 1850s particularly with his 1862 visual conception of molecular disgregation Similarly in 1859 after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Clausius Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range This was the firstever statistical law in physics

In 1864 Ludwig Boltzmann a young student in Vienna came across Maxwells paper and was so inspired by it that he spent much of his long and distinguished life developing the subject further Later Boltzmann in efforts to develop a kinetic theory for the behavior of a gas applied the laws of probability to Maxwells and Clausius molecular interpretation of entropy so to begin to interpret entropy in terms of order and disorder Similarly in 1882 Hermann von Helmholtz used the word Unordnung disorder to describe entropy

To highlight the fact that order and disorder are commonly understood to be measured in terms of entropy below are current science encyclopedia and science dictionary definitions of entropy


Entropy and disorder also have associations with equilibrium Technically entropy from this perspective is defined as a thermodynamic property which serves as a measure of how close a system is to equilibrium  that is to perfect internal disorder Likewise the value of the entropy of a distribution of atoms and molecules in a thermodynamic system is a measure of the disorder in the arrangements of its particles In a stretched out piece of rubber for example the arrangement of the molecules of its structure has an ordered distribution and has zero entropy while the disordered kinky distribution of the atoms and molecules in the rubber in the nonstretched state has positive entropy Similarly in a gas the order is perfect and the measure of entropy of the system has its lowest value when all the molecules are in one place whereas when more points are occupied the gas is all the more disorderly and the measure of the entropy of the system has its largest value

In systems ecology as another example the entropy of a collection of items comprising a system is defined as a measure of their disorder or equivalently the relative likelihood of the instantaneous configuration of the items Moreover according to theoretical ecologist and chemical engineer Robert Ulanowicz that entropy might provide a quantification of the heretofore subjective notion of disorder has spawned innumerable scientific and philosophical narratives In particular many biologists have taken to speaking in terms of the entropy of an organism or about its antonym negentropy as a measure of the structural order within an organism

The mathematical basis with respect to the association entropy has with order and disorder began essentially with the famous Boltzmann formula formula2 which relates entropy S to the number of possible states W in which a system can be found As an example consider a box that is divided into two sections What is the probability that a certain number or all of the particles will be found in one section versus the other when the particles are randomly allocated to different places within the box If you only have one particle then that system of one particle can subsist in two states one side of the box versus the other If you have more than one particle or define states as being further locational subdivisions of the box the entropy is larger because the number of states is greater The relationship between entropy order and disorder in the Boltzmann equation is so clear among physicists that according to the views of thermodynamic ecologists Sven Jorgensen and Yuri Svirezhev it is obvious that entropy is a measure of order or most likely disorder in the system In this direction the second law of thermodynamics as famously enunciated by Rudolf Clausius in 1865 states that

Thus if entropy is associated with disorder and if the entropy of the universe is headed towards maximal entropy then many are often puzzled as to the nature of the ordering process and operation of evolution in relation to Clausius most famous version of the second law which states that the universe is headed towards maximal disorder In the recent 2003 book SYNC  the Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order by Steven Strogatz for example we find Scientists have often been baffled by the existence of spontaneous order in the universe The laws of thermodynamics seem to dictate the opposite that nature should inexorably degenerate toward a state of greater disorder greater entropy Yet all around us we see magnificent structuresgalaxies cells ecosystems human beingsthat have all somehow managed to assemble themselves 

The common argument used to explain this is that locally entropy can be lowered by external action eg solar heating action and that this applies to machines such as a refrigerator where the entropy in the cold chamber is being reduced to growing crystals and to living organisms This local increase in order is however only possible at the expense of an entropy increase in the surroundings here more disorder must be created The conditioner of this statement suffices that living systems are open systems in which both heat mass and or work may transfer into or out of the system Unlike temperature the putative entropy of a living system would drastically change if the organism were thermodynamically isolated If an organism was in this type of isolated situation its entropy would increase markedly as the onceliving components of the organism decayed to an unrecognizable mass

Owing to these early developments the typical example of entropy change S is that associated with phase change In solids for example which are typically ordered on the molecular scale usually have smaller entropy than liquids and liquids have smaller entropy than gases and colder gases have smaller entropy than hotter gases Moreover according to the third law of thermodynamics at absolute zero temperature crystalline structures are approximated to have perfect order and zero entropy This correlation occurs because the numbers of different microscopic quantum energy states available to an ordered system are usually much smaller than the number of states available to a system that appears to be disordered

From his famous 1896 Lectures on Gas Theory Boltzmann diagrams the structure of a solid body as shown above by postulating that each molecule in the body has a rest position According to Boltzmann if it approaches a neighbor molecule it is repelled by it but if it moves farther away there is an attraction This of course was a revolutionary perspective in its time many during these years did not believe in the existence of either atoms or molecules see history of the molecule According to these early views and others such as those developed by William Thomson if energy in the form of heat is added to a solid so to make it into a liquid or a gas a common depiction is that the ordering of the atoms and molecules becomes more random and chaotic with an increase in temperature

Thus according to Boltzmann owing to increases in thermal motion whenever heat is added to a working substance the rest position of molecules will be pushed apart the body will expand and this will create more molardisordered distributions and arrangements of molecules These disordered arrangements subsequently correlate via probability arguments to an increase in the measure of entropy

In the quest for ultracold temperatures a temperature lowering technique called adiabatic demagnetization is used where atomic entropy considerations are utilized which can be described in orderdisorder terms In this process a sample of solid such as chromealum salt whose molecules are equivalent to tiny magnets is inside an insulated enclosure cooled to a low temperature typically 2 or 4 kelvins with a strong magnetic field being applied to the container using a powerful external magnet so that the tiny molecular magnets are aligned forming a wellordered initial state at that low temperature This magnetic alignment means that the magnetic energy of each molecule is minimal The external magnetic field is then reduced a removal that is considered to be closely reversible Following this reduction the atomic magnets then assume random lessordered orientations owing to thermal agitations in the final state

The disorder and hence the entropy associated with the change in the atomic alignments has clearly increased In terms of energy flow the movement from a magnetically aligned state requires energy from the thermal motion of the molecules converting thermal energy into magnetic energy Yet according to the second law of thermodynamics because no heat can enter or leave the container due to its adiabatic insulation the system should exhibit no change in entropy ie S  0 The increase in disorder however associated with the randomizing directions of the atomic magnets represents an entropy increase To compensate for this the disorder entropy associated with the temperature of the specimen must decrease by the same amount The temperature thus falls as a result of this process of thermal energy being converted into magnetic energy If the magnetic field is then increased the temperature rises and the magnetic salt has to be cooled again using a cold material such as liquid helium

In recent years the longstanding use of term disorder to discuss entropy has met with some criticism

Tristram JonesParry
Tristram JonesParry born 23 July 1947 is a British teacher of mathematics He was headmaster of Emanuel School 19941998 and Westminster School 19982005 two independent schools in the UK and is currently the head of the sixth form at Hampton Court House School He was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church Oxford

Upon his departure from Westminster JonesParry received a great amount of attachment and approval from staff and pupils He was depicted as an excellent leader and educator who devoted his time entirely for the sake of education rather than to building excessive relationship with external highsociety figures who bears a warm heart under a stern appearance who will always be remembered for picking up rubbish from the Little Deans Yard ground There was rumour that he was in argument with the school council over issues concerning the allocation of funds gathered from benefactors The council thought the fund should be used for improving school facilities while he was of the opinion that the money should be provided to smart students unable to afford fees

He became involved in media and political controversy in 2004 when on retiring from independent schools at the age of 58 after 30 years teaching experience applied to teach in a state school in order to give a bit back but was rejected by the General Teaching Council on the basis that he had not completed the PGCE teacher training course which is obligatory for teachers in the state sector but not in the independent schools insisting also that they were obliged to apply this rule rigidly
Critics of the decision labelled it totally absurd given JonesParrys long teaching experience in leading independent schools and as Headmaster of Westminster  frequently cited as the most academically successful school in the country The growing media controversy surrounding the issue further spotlighted what many saw as a particularly onerous example of bureaucratic pedantry leading to pressure on the then Education Secretary Charles Clarke from his own advisers to change the rules Following a decision that the rules were necessary in order to preserve standards the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT endorsed it and the Teacher Training Agency stated that a fasttrack route for qualified teachers already exists

JonesParry is now head of the innovative independent Sixth Form at Hampton Court House School In 2015 Tristram JonesParry was interviewed on BBC Breakfast where he highlighted the benefits of later start times for teenagers

American Beverage Association
The American Beverage Association ABA is a trade organization that represents the beverage industry in the United States Its members include producers and bottlers of soft drinks bottled water and other nonalcoholic beverages

The organization was founded in 1919 and originally named the American Bottlers of Carbonated Beverages In 1966 it renamed itself the National Soft Drink Association Then in November 2004 it changed to its current name to better reflect the expanded range of nonalcoholic beverages the industry produces

The associations leaders include Chair Larry Young president and CEO of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Vice Chair Hugh Johnson president of PepsiCola North America and President Susan Neely president of the American Beverage Association 
Its members are bottling companies and other beverage industry firms including
Bulldog Americas Corporation several CocaCola and PepsiCola bottlers PepsiAmericas Inc and Royal Crown Bottling Corporation

The American Beverage Associations lobbying efforts have recently skyrocketed largely to finance the industrys opposition to legislators considering increased taxes on soft drinks given their impact on Americans health The Association annual spent about 391000 to more than 690000 annually on lobbying from 2003 to 2008 In the 2010 election cycle its lobbying grew more than 1000 percent to 867 million These funds are helping to pay for 25 lobbyists at seven different lobbying firms

In September 2009 a New England Journal of Medicine study called for taxes on sugarsweetened beverages saying that these actions would cut rates of dietrelated diseases and health care costs Written by experts in nutrition public health and economics the study called for an excise tax of a penny per ounce on soft drinks and other beverages that have added sweeteners such as sucrose high fructose corn syrup or fruitjuice concentrates The expectation is that such a tax could reduce calorie consumption from sweetened beverages by 10 and create revenue that governments could use to pay for health programs A report on the New England Journal of Medicine study can be read here

To counter these protax efforts the American Beverage Association and other beverage industry companies have established an Americans Against Food Taxes coalition and website Their efforts include national advertising and other actions positioning the proposed taxes as taxing hardworking families This groups actions have been opposed by protax organizations including the Center for Science in the Public Interest

To date 33 states have taxes on soft drinks but they are too low to affect consumption and the revenues are not earmarked for health programs according to the New England Journal of Medicine study

Rameses mascot
Rameses is the ram mascot of the North Carolina Tar Heels Three versions of Rameses appear at UNC sporting events One is a member of the UNC cheerleading team in an anthropomorphic ram costume the second is also an anthropomorphic ram costume and the third is a live Dorset Horn sheep named Rameses who attends Carolina football games with his horns painted Carolina blue

The origin of a ram as North Carolinas mascot dates back to 1924 In 1922 the star fullback Jack Merritt was given the nickname the battering ram for his performance on the field as well as for an initiation ritual he created for male freshman students Vic Huggins North Carolinas head cheerleader at the time suggested the idea of a ram mascot to the athletic business manager Charles T Woollen and had the idea approved Charles gave Vic 25 to purchase a ram Rameses the First was shipped from Texas just in time for the pep rally

The first appearance of Rameses was at a pep rally before the football game against Virginia Military Institute on November 8 1924 After the pep rally the ram was taken to Emerson Field Through three quarters the game was scoreless Late in the fourth quarter Bunn Hackney was called out to attempt a field goal Before stepping out on the field he rubbed Rameses head Just a few seconds later Hackney kicked a 30yard field goal that eventually won the game for the Tar Heels the final score was 30 Rameses has been a fixture on the sidelines at UNC football games ever since The current Rameses ram is under the care of the Hogan family of Chapel Hill

The origin of the costumed version of Rameses dates back to the 198788 season Auditions were held and a senior Eric Chilton from Mount Airy North Carolina was given the honor to be the first mascot Since auditions were held in the middle of the school year he only served for half a year and only showed up in a few basketball games in early 1988 The costume was made locally and looked different from the one used today

On the evening of October 26 2015 Rameses Jr or RJ for short made his debut during Late Night with Roy North Carolina Tar Heels mens basketballs annual Midnight Madness event Brown Walters the director of spirit programs at UNC Chapel Hill told The Daily Tar Heel it took a year to come up with the concept of RJ RJ was conceived in part to expand the reach of UNC Chapel Hills spirit program RJs design featuring a less muscular body Carolina blue horns blue eyes and Jordanbrand apparel was also developed to appeal to children Walters said small children were frightened by the current version of the Rameses costume

In February 1996 Rameses XXIII was killed in his pasture at the Hogan farm An attacker slashed the rams throat and cut off its left front leg stabbing it as many as 10 times along its chest and neck State veterinarians stated that the slash to its throat was most likely the fatal wound Police later charged 26yearold Scott Wade Wade stumbled onto the Hogan farm drunk at the time of the slaying Investigators believed Wade killed the ram because he was hungry Wade was later charged with misdemeanor animal cruelty

On March 23 2007 Jason Ray a member of the UNC Chapel Hill cheerleading squad was struck by a vehicle near a Hilton Hotel on Route 4 in Fort Lee New Jersey The Tar Heel mens basketball team had advanced to the 2007 East Regional Semifinals and the Fort Lee Hilton was the Tar Heel team hotel Ray was walking to a convenience store to buy a burrito and a soda before he was due to portray Rameses in the game against the USC Trojans Ray died on March 26 2007 at the Hackensack University Medical Center as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident

Ray was an honors student and was due to graduate that May with a degree in business administration and a minor in religious studies He was an Eagle Scout with Troop 38 in Concord NC had gone on three missionary trips Haiti Honduras and Puerto Rico to work with children had visited the Sistine Chapel ran with the bulls in Spain and spent a summer studying in Copenhagen Denmark Ray was also an active member of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship his church choir and was the lead singer in the band Nine PM Traffic

Four people received organ transplants because of Rays decision to become an organ donor

On April 16 2016 UNC Hospitals dedicated its transplant clinic to Ray An endowment fund also dedicated to Ray was started to raise funds for patients unable to pay for their transplants The Ray family pledged to raise one million dollars for this endowment fund
On September 21 2017 it was announced Rameses and RJ would wear patches commemorating honoring Rays memory for all sporting events held during the 201718 season starting with the 2017 North Carolina Tar Heels football teams game against Duke

Primatte chromakey technology
Primatte is a brand of chroma key software used in motion picture television and photographic host applications to remove solid colored backgrounds greenscreen or bluescreen usually and replace them with transparency to facilitate background replacement It uses a unique algorithm based on three multifaceted polyhedrons floating in RGB colorspace that are used to isolate color regions in the foreground image Primatte is often referred to as a compositing technology and is usually used as a plugin for host products such as Adobe After Effects Adobe Photoshop Autodesk Media and Entertainment Inferno or Flame Eyeon Fusion and several other compositing and editing software packages
Primatte is usually activated on a foreground image with a person or other foreground object filmed or digitized against a solid colored background or backing screen usually a bluescreen or a greenscreen The solid colored background area is removed and replaced with transparency This allows the user to replace the solid colored background with a background image of his choice

If the foreground object was filmed close to the backing screen or with less than ideal lighting conditions the foreground object will usually have spill somewhere on it This is most common when filming blonde people against a blue or greenscreen as their translucent hair will absorb the backing screen color Such colorspill can be removed and replaced with several options to achieve a more realistic result

Another problem is chromakeying images that were created on film stock is that some film stocks have a distinct film grain to them A large amount of film grain will often cause rough edges around the foreground object Rough edges can be minimized to achieve a smoother transition between the edges of the chroma keyed foreground object and the user selected background image

The Primatte algorithm was created by Yasushi Mishima while working at IMAGICA Corporation in Tokyo Japan in 1992 The basic algorithm utilized in Primatte was originally presented at the 8th NICOGRAPH Conference and the 23rd Imaging Technology Conference and a US patent was granted in 1994

It was initially released as a standalone product on Silicon Graphics workstations but it was later determined to be more useful as a plugin actuated from within a host application This alleviated the need to save the images exit the host compositing application start Primatte load the images create the chroma key save the images start the host application load the images and continue creating the composition Since then it has been ported to almost every major compositing and editing software application on the market The current version is the fourth generation of the Primatte technology and has features such as AutoCompute that automatically detects the backing screen color eliminates it and does cleanup on the foreground and backing screen area noise It is available on the Microsoft Windows Red Hat Linux SGI IRIX and the Apple Macintosh platforms

The Primatte chromakey algorithm is a method of color space segmentation where Primatte segments all the colors in the foreground image into one of four separate categories The result is a spill suppressed foreground image and a matte which is used to apply the modified foreground to a suitable background

Primatte works in 3D RGB color space Here is a visual representation of the Primatte algorithm after an image has been processed
The user essentially creates three concentric multifaceted polyhedrons These can be pictured as three globes or polyhedrons or polys one within the other which share a common center point The creation of these polyhedrons separates all possible foreground colors into one of four regions inside the small polyhedron 1 between the small and medium polyhedrons 2 between the medium and the large polyhedrons 3 and outside the large polyhedron 4

Beige catshark
The beige catshark Parmaturus bigus is a cat shark of the family Scyliorhinidae The first recorded specimen was a female recorded off the coast of Queensland Australia around Lord Howe Island Its length was 72cm

Recently a number of both male and female specimens unpublished data were captured in the waters off New Zealand at the edge of the EEZ exclusive economic zone To date very little is known about the ecology of this species Scientists are currently studying the sensory systems of this catshark in order to reveal information about its ecology and ultimately behaviour The reproduction is of this catshark is oviparous

United States coinage type set
United States coinage type set is a visual collection of each of the types of coins produced by the US Mints A Type set collection is enjoyed by some collectors of coins who try to collect one example of as many types of coins as they can

Due to various reasons including prohibitive cost collectors will sometimes group several different coins together as one type For example one could collect a Liberty Seated dime quarter and half dollar and call that their example of a Liberty Seated coin for each denomination Or they could choose to collect an example of subtypes within the Liberty Seated design including the with and without arrows at date and with and without mottos

Additionally delineating subtypes within a particular design is not always consistent For example almost all type collectors consider the 1909 VDB Lincoln cent to be different from the 1909 noVDB Lincoln cent where the designers initials VDB were displayed on the bottom of the reverse and removed about a month later However the VDB initials were returned to the Lincoln cent in 1918 on the bottom of the bust on the obverse and almost no type collector considers this a separate type Likewise in the Lincoln cent series the composition change in 1943 to steel and the composition change in 1982 from bronze to copperplated zinc are considered separate types by almost all but the brass composition used in 19441946 is not considered a separate type from the 1947 return to bronze The Lincoln cent series is full of other examples including modifications to the size of Lincolns bust during the early 1970s

Consequently each collector will need to decide for themselves how specific they wish to be when putting together a US coin type set though the decision is often made for them if they choose specific albums such as the very popular Dansco 7070

Arthur Paul Pedrick
Arthur Paul Pedrick 3 September 1918  15 August 1976 was a prolific British inventor who filed for 162 United Kingdom patents between 1962 and his death in 1976 or 1977 His inventions were notable for their humour and almost complete lack of practical applicability

Very little is known about Pedrick He worked for many years as a patent examiner at the United Kingdom Patent Office but that it was only after his retirement that he began filing patent applications for his inventions The Patent Office has stringent restrictions on improbable gadgets but Pedricks familiarity with the process enabled him to satisfy the requirements and get his applications granted

During this period he was resident in Selsey Sussex England according to his patents Sometimes his residence would further be listed as OneMan PhotoElectric Research Laboratories or One Man Think Tank Nuclear Fusion Research Laboratories and so forth These laboratories were staffed by himself and a ginger coloured cat sometimes referred to as Ginger although it is not clear whether this was actually his name Ginger was of great help to Pedrick in developing his inventions Unfortunately it is recounted in some of the patents how Ginger was unable to secure financing to put the inventions into practice

His patent for laser induced fusion includes these autobiographical notes

It is my personal experience based on a severe bout of Dive bombing by Stuka dive bombers in a light cruiser HMS Dido in 1941 evacuating mainly New Zealanders from Crete who had been sent in by the late Sir Winston Churchill but who after the battle with the Nazi paratroops had made the island untenable Admiral Cunningham the Naval C in C in Alexandria realised must be got out if possible that the surface warships just cannot survive attacks by large numbers of aircraft on their own and it is only the chance of fate that I happened to be in After Engine Room of the ship when a bomb came down on B turret and created a carnage of twisted steel and bodies forward that I am writing this now but the memory of the experience still gives me a nightmare at times

I have suffered all my life even from a by product of the 191418 war even if I was born after it It is a personal fact that my father was a Lieutenant E serving in the disastrous K class submarines by which the Royal Navy tried to create a Submarine which could steam on the surface at 20 knots to keep up with the Fleet and he died of a lung infection created by the appalling conditions in such submarines even before I was born If a women sic is in bad metal sic state when she is in pregnant it is obvious that she can pass on her state of mind to the foetus This has made me a nervous individual all my life and there are many times in my life I wish I had never been born There are endless arguments about the subject of abortion on the rights of the foetus and these could all be settled if in some way the future could be predicted for the foetus and it could decide whether it wanted to be born

Many of Pedricks inventions related to his cat Ginger His crowning achievement in this respect was patent GB1426698 titled Photon PushPull Radiation Detector For Use in Chromatically Selective Cat Flap Control And 1000 Megaton EarthOrbital PeaceKeeping Bomb

The idea was to detect the difference in fur colour between a ginger cat and a black cat He came up with this idea because a black cat named Blackie from next door kept trying to steal his own cats food However with Pedricks new catflap design if Blackie attempted to use the catflap he would not be allowed in Ginger was impressed with the idea and further suggested that the concept could be applied as a nuclear deterrent Gingers concern over the Cold War and the nuclear arsenals threatening the world was a regular motivator for Pedricks inventions

Pedrick was also concerned with the safety of his fellow man and thus described in GB1453920 an Apparatus For Extinguishing Fires in High Rise Block Buildings of Uniform Transverse CrossSection Or Plan

Here Pedrick suggests that fire curtains could be secured at the roof level of a highrise building When released they would envelope substantially the entire building The curtains could be provided with apertures which when the curtain is released are located opposite rooms in the building these rooms being designated as ones in which the occupants should congregate in the event of fire The concern however was that such large curtains would have prevented escape from the building as well as increase the risk of suffocation

Pedricks concern for his fellow man is again shown in GB1047735 titled Arrangements for the transfer of fresh water from one location on the earths surface to another at a different latitude for the purpose of irrigation with pumping energy derived from the effect of the earths rotation about the polar axis

In this patent Pedrick describes in extremely long detail with pages of mathematical equations how snow and ice could be passed along pipelines from the Antarctic to irrigate the dry Australian outback creating a granary of the East that could feed the burgeoning population of the world Since the flow of water from one region to the other through such pipelines would not be practicable according to Pedrick the suggestion is to instead compress the snow into hard balls that could be fired along these pipelines as projectiles

Pedrick would often discuss within his patents the problems in the world that led him to his inventions and would also recount conversations between himself and his ginger cat Some of these tangents in his patents show Pedrick to be a thoughtful if slightly eccentric man who was deeply concerned with the wellbeing of others and for the future of mankind as well as being dismissive of modern capitalism

Characteristic observations on the world around him include the following

Funny patents such as those published by Pedrick and their popularisation in the media upset many patent examiners who feel they tend to trivialise the subject

Thumelicus
Thumelicus born 15 AD died before 47 AD probably in 30 or 31 was the only son of the Cherusci leader Arminius and his wife Thusnelda daughter of the proRoman tribal leader Segestes

In May 15 AD Arminius besieged Segestes at his stronghold where Thusnelda then pregnant was staying The Roman commander Germanicus a nephew of Emperor Tiberius broke through the siege and took her prisoner Thusnelda and the infant Thumelicus were presented in Rome in the Triumph Germanicus was allowed to celebrate in May 17 AD Afterwards the captives were spared but were sent to exile in Ravenna where Thumelicus probably was raised and trained as a gladiator 

Tacitus promises to recount his fate at the proper time ie when his Annals treat the year in question  but there is no further mention in the extant copy A major gap exists for 30 and 31 AD however so it could be that Thumelicus was killed in the arena at the age of 15 or 16

Colorado Referendum J
Current law in Colorado requires school districts to set aside money from within the total budget for specific purposes such as buildings and insurance books and other school supplies and services for atrisk students These specific budgetary earmarks account on average for approximately 600 per student according to 20042005 school year figures  roughly eight percent of district operating budgets Referendum J proposes a new requirement that each school district spend a minimum of 65 of its operating budget on a set of budget items specified in the referendum

Referendum J would require that 65 of school district operating budgets be spent on the following budgetary items

Notably absent from the budgetary earmarks in Referendum J are

Schools that fall short of budgetary requirements set forth in Referendum J would be required to increase budgetary earmarks for specified items by two percent per year until minimums are met Provisions are made for districts to request a waiver for a period of one year Referendum J allows voters to exempt specific districts from its budgetary requirements and standardizes budget submission formats to the state to facilitate tracking of Referendum J compliance

The Colorado Department of Educations oversight of Referendum J requirements is expected to increase state costs by approximately 62000 annually School district costs may also be increased by requiring more detailed expenditure tracking budget planning and budget submission procedures introduced with Referendum J if it passes Referendum J does not increase funding for public education

Also on the 2006 ballot is Amendment 39 a proposed amendment to the state Constitution which also proposes changes to school district budgetary requirements Notably different is the fact that Amendment 39 does not require that any of the earmarked 65 of funding go to principals support staff or support services provided at the school level

The two ballot items also define a districts operating budget differently which can affect various districts differently Using the 20042005 school year as an example the budget expenditures on items specified in Referendum J received 83 of district operating budgets on average already well over the 65 that would be required by the new law while according to Amendment 39s budget definitions only 60 of the budget was already spent in that year on the budget items specified by Amendment 39

Aside from the average however individual school budget analyses show that at least some schools in the state failed to meet the 65 requirements set forth by each of the ballot proposals 166 school districts would have fallen short by a total of 278 million according to the requirements of Amendment 39 while three districts would have fallen short for a total of approximately one million dollars under the requirements of Referendum J if they had both been in effect for the 20042005 school year
