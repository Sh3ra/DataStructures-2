Compliance and ethics program
Since about 1970 several major business and government excesses were seen in the United States to generate subsequent legal public and political reaction The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is perhaps the legislation with the most significant influence in the development of ethics and compliance programs similar ideas are encoded in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA marked the early beginnings of compliance programs in the United States In the mid1970s United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC investigations discovered that a significant number of American companies participated in bribery overseas Over 400 US Companies admitted to making questionable or illegal payments to foreign government officials politicians and political parties United States Department of Justice 2006 One of the most infamous cases of its time was the admission by a Lockheed executive to the Multinational Corporations Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Lockheed had paid bribes in the amount of 22 million to Japanese government officials in the course of trying to sell its aircraft This revelation came on the heels of the US Government providing Lockheed with a 250 million emergency loan guarantee Hishikawa 2003

In an effort to restore faith in American business in December 1977 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law This antibribery provision makes it unlawful for a US person and certain foreign issuers of securities to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with or directing business to any person United States Department of Justice 2006 The law also requires publicly traded companies to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent the companys transactions Additionally it requires these companies to have an adequate systems of internal accounting controls United States Department of Justice 2006

Following the passage of the FCPA in 1988 the Congress became concerned that American companies were operating at a disadvantage because their foreign counterparts were as a matter of practice paying bribes to foreign officials and deducting those bribes as business expenses on their taxes United States Department of Justice 2006 Subsequently the Executive Branch began negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD a 34member nation coalition consisting of the United States and 33 other countries to enact legislation similar to FCPA In 1997 the OCED signed the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions httpwwwoecdorgdocument2102340en2649348592017813111100html

This regulation requires member nations to designate the payment of bribes to foreign offices as a crime and to follow the rules and regulations that govern bribery in international transactions The US ratified this convention and enacted implementing legislation in 1998 At this time the FCPA was amended to include territorial jurisdiction over foreign companies and nationals A foreign company or person is now subject to the FCPA if the company or person either directly or indirectly through agents engages in acts which further the facilitation of corrupt payments taking place within the territory of the United States

In response to the FCPA and its requirement to implement internal control programs in 1985 a privatesector initiative was formed called the National Committee on Fraudulent Financial Reporting commonly known as the Treadway Commission This Commission recommended that its organizational sponsors work together to develop guidance on internal controls Subsequently the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO was formed and in conjunction with the CPA firm Coopers  Lybrand COSO authored and published in 1992 the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework This framework has become the de facto standard in the accounting industry for auditing evaluating and monitoring internal control systems

The COSO Internal ControlIntegrated Framework is now widely used by most organizations as the basis for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting  15 USC  7262 and for the assessment of control effectiveness under section 404 of SarbanesOxley

In 1984 Congress passed the Sentencing Reform Act which created a set of mandatory federal sentencing guidelines Campbell  Bemporad 2006 As part of the Act the United States Sentencing Commission was formed and delegated the responsibility to provide certainty and fairness in sentencing avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities while maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentencing when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors Campbell  Bemporad 2006

On May 1 1991 as an extension of the Sentencing Reform Act the United States Sentencing Commission submitted to Congress the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations FSGO a set of standards that govern the sentences federal judges impose on organizations convicted of federal crimes Enacted on November 1 1991 core to the guidelines was the Commissions intent to prevent and deter organizational wrongdoing through its design of the organizational sentencing guidelines These guidelines describe the elements of an organizations compliance and ethics program that are required to be considered for eligibility for a reduced sentence if convicted In general the FSGO require an organization to establish standards to guide its employees and agents These standards must reflect government regulations and industry standards and apply to almost all types of organizations including corporations partnerships unions nonprofit organizations and trusts

In 2004 the United States Sentencing Commission voted to amend its existing organization guidelines to make the criteria for an effective compliance and ethics program more stringent Two major standards were identified in the amended guidelines The amended guidelines stated the need for directors and executives to take an active role in the management of its compliance and ethics program and the importance of promoting an organizational culture that is compliant with the law and demonstrates ethical culture The amended guidelines outline minimum requirements for an effective compliance and ethics program and the amended FSGO has become synonymous with an effective compliance program

The FCPA SarbanesOxley SOX and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines represent just a fraction of the standards and requirements organizations need to consider today when developing and implementing their compliance programs Since the passage of SOX the New York Stock Exchange NYSE NASDAQ and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB have all proposed and implemented new rules relating to compliance programs Martin 2004 Organizations today are increasingly accountable to mandated laws regulations and standards on a number of dimensions which include geographicalregional considerations as well as industry and functional discipline concerns These regulations and standards apply to a variety of financial and nonfinancial areas Adding to this complexity are the voluntary boundaries which organizations have individually established such as organizational commitments values and contractual obligations As a result of these dynamics organizations at the very core of their business strategy need to establish the capacity and the capability to effectively address the conditions mandated by these external requirements and internally generated operating principles while still meeting their business objectives

History set the tone for increasing regulations and rising standards Over time organizations will need to be more proactive in anticipating and addressing these considerations while simultaneously protecting and building the enterprise More and more organizations will need to translate integrate and simplify these various standards and requirements into a cohesive approach

Designing an effective compliance and ethics program requires implementing a detailed plan that will make sure the business achieves their ethics objectives The organization must have ways of managing evaluating and controlling business ethics and compliance programs There are five items which can affect the success of the compliance and ethics program 1 the content of the companys code of ethics 2 the frequency of communication regarding the ethical code and program 3 the quality of communication 4 senior managements ability to successfully incorporate ethics into the organization 5 and local managements ability to do the same

Compliance and ethics program with regulatory requirements and the organizations own policies are a critical component of effective risk management An organizations program is recommended to include monitoring and auditing systems that allow detection of criminal and other improper context to be found easily Maintaining the compliance and ethics program is one of the most important ways for an organization to maintain its ethical health support its longterm prosperity and preserve and promote its values

A compliance and ethics program supports the organizations business objectives identifies the boundaries of legal and ethical behavior and establishes a system to alert management when the organization is getting close to or crossing a boundary or approaching an obstacle that prevents the achievement of a business objective

Management should continuously improve its compliance and ethics program This will enable it to better prevent detect and respond to similar misfeasance andor malfeasance in the future

The compliance and ethics program should strive to deliver tangible benefits and outcomes to the organization Every organization is unique and has its own objectives As such several objectives of the compliance and ethics program will be unique as well There are a few universal program outcomesobjectives that a compliance and ethics capability should deliver These include an enhanced culture of trust accountability and integrity prevention of noncompliance preparation for when not if noncompliance occurs protection to the extent possible from negative consequences detection of noncompliance response to noncompliance and improvement of the program to better prevent protect prepare detect and respond to noncompliance

An important aspect of a highperforming program and one that cannot be overstated is enhancing an ethical culture A strong ethical culture that provides important benefits would including a safety net for when formal controls are weak or absent and an open environment of trust ingredients that help drive overall workforce productivity

A welldesigned compliance and ethics program is only half the picture Critical to its success and its ability to meet the challenges of constant change increasing complexity rapidly evolving threats the need for continuous improvement requires organizations to have the commitment of both senior management and the board adequate authorization and funding the appropriate tools to facilitate measurement and rollingup information comprehensive training on the measurement process and an early socialization of approach

Implementation is often the most difficult aspect of any program This is the juncture where most failure occurs However if executed well it can represent the biggest opportunity for positive influence on the organizations performance and culture

The engaged involvement of key stakeholders is critical to a successful implementation or major enhancement of a compliance and ethics program ie the dialogue and agreement up front by all the major parties regarding the objectives goals and overall purpose of the program will be critical to the projects eventual impact By working together compliance and ethics officers executive management and the board can help ensure a compliance and ethics program not only contributes to the improvement of the organizations governance practices but the success of its companys strategy as well

One of most important conditions for an ethics program to be effectively implemented is the existence of a feeling of trust from the employees toward the organization Organizations that present high levels of misconduct will experience lack of trust from its employees which possible will cause high turnover among its workforce

Integrate compliance and ethics  Address the letter of the law while promoting the spirit of the law For some companies this means making a breach of company policy as serious as breaching laws resulting in internal standards being as important as mandatory standards

Embed compliance and ethics risk management processes into the business  Organizations must systematically assess and prioritize present and emerging compliance and ethics risks Such analysis should take into account the organizations culture compliance and ethics history as well as industry issues Business processes should incorporate compliance and ethics program needs Boards should routinely discuss these risks and how they are addressed with management

Demonstrate leadership  The board should ensure senior management consistently communicates and models the organizations values and behavioral expectations identified in the compliance and ethics program

Require accountability and ownership  In order to have the compliance and ethics program make a difference it should foster a corporate culture that places responsibility on individuals for their actions and motivates everyone The board and management should ensure employees have appropriate training and information and should participate in such training themselves

Provide an open culture  Issues and problems should be and in some cases are required by law to be investigated and proactively managed to resolution Unethical or illegal behavior should be addressed promptly Employees must be required to raise and resolve violations of compliance or ethics standards To do so they must feel confident that they can take action without fear of retaliation Such fears have been reduced but not eliminated with the introduction of the whistleblower protections of the SarbanesOxley Act and the Canadian equivalents The board should inquire of management the steps they are taking to create this open culture

Measure performance and results  Compliance and ethics processes and results should be monitored and measured Objective data should support evaluations that are more subjective Evaluation results should provide the basis for continually improving the program

By using accurate timely data on the organizations performance managers know whether they are moving the entity closer to its objectives Measuring compliance and ethics program performance help organizations gauge their improvement and learn whether the companys tactics are contributing to the success of the companys strategy Keeping the board informed is a critical activity and robust performance reporting facilitates that important effort too An organizations compliance and ethics program should be measured like any other critical capability

There are numerous benefits and challenges to measuring the performance of a program A wellknown maxim is what gets measured gets done The compliance and ethics program and capability is no different

The Open Compliance and Ethics Group OCEG a nonprofit organization that provides a performance framework for integrating governance compliance risk management and culture has developed a Measurement and Metrics Guide MMG for assisting in measuring and reporting on the performance of compliance and ethics programs This measurement platform advocates that program objectives be aligned with and contribute to the enterprise objectives in a tangible way In order to achieve desired program outcomes an organization should design processes and practices that effectively measure program dimensions on three key dimensions effectiveness efficiency and responsiveness



A solid measurement system and approach should be implemented that embodies these principles 
Key metrics and indicators should be specificsimple measurable actionable relevant and timely

Performance measurement system should be reviewed and improved on an ongoing basis It is only by gaining experience measuring performance that the organization can really refine and improve the system

Compliance risk is the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of or nonconformance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of the Banks clients may be ambiguous or untested This risk exposes the institution to fines civil money penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation reduced franchise value limited business opportunities reduced expansion potential and an inability to enforce contracts

Governance Risk Management and Compliance GRC management capability is the solution to addressing increasing stakeholder expectations Solid financial results are no longer sufficient Stakeholders are demanding more They want to know about nonfinancial results and the intangibles that will ensure financial growth They want increased reporting and transparency and insight into an organizations strategy risks and operations along with an understanding of the manner in which business is conducted As with the quality movement of the mid1980s to early 1990s these stakeholder demands are becoming baseline expectations

Compliance and ethics practices can no longer be viewed in isolation of the rest of the organization as some function off to the side to keep an organization out of jail It must become part of the overall business strategy and operations pervasive throughout the entire organization Ultimately taking this integrated approach will lead to better overall performance and compliance will become less of a burden on the business

Thessaloniki Underwater Artery
The Underwater Artery  in Thessaloniki Greece is a planned multilane stretch of expressway along the seafront of the city and 
underneath the seabed Its purpose is to alleviate traffic problems within the city center

Proposals for the construction of the Underwater Artery have received heated debate since at least the early 90s Proponents suggest that the project will create a bypass for most of the EastWest car traffic which currently has to cross the congested city centre given that Thessaloniki is especially linear as a city Opponents cite the high construction cost question the efficacy of such a solution and voice concerns about effects on the urban environment

The contracts between the State and the contractor were signed on October 31 2006 They 
were ratified by the Parliament on February 8 2007

The project has a budget of 472 million euro of which 665 million are to be provided by public and the rest by private funding The operation of tolls will be granted to the contractor for a period of 30 years the toll fee has been set at 090 euro

The road is planned as a 6lane expressway with a length of 65 kilometres of which 4 kilometres will be in a tunnel The roof of the tunnel will be at least one meter underneath the seabed The western end will be at the port area and the eastern end will be close to the Makedonia Pallas hotel

Upon the completion of the works Leoforos Nikis the seafront avenue which currently receives heavy eastward traffic is to be pedestrianised

Agua Caliente Racetrack
The Agua Caliente Racetrack current name Caliente Hipdromo is a greyhound racing and former horse racing track in Tijuana Baja California Mexico It opened in December 1929 at a cost of 25 million

One year before the Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel opened in June 1928

Now the largest branch of the Caliente casino chain the renovated building houses a casino with race betting hundreds of slot machines a restaurant and a Starbucks caf The complex includes the Estadio Caliente sports and concert stadium

Like the resort the racetrack was designed by Wayne McAllister and built by wealthy Americans Baron Long a Los Angeles nightclub owner Wirt Bowman owner of the Tijuana gambling establishment The Foreign Club and James Croffroth a member of the local Tijuana horseracing establishment Some sources note the fourth partner was Abelardo L Rodrguez Military Commander and Governor of Baja California and future President of Mexico The lavish resort and racetrack on the Mexican border was popular among Americans particularly Hollywood celebrities because drinking gambling and horse racing were still illegal in most of the neighboring US states The first manager of the track was Tommy Gorman who had previously been involved in ice hockey

Although President Lzaro Crdenas outlawed gambling in 1935 and closed the resort and casino the Agua Caliente Racetrack continued to operate for many years It was the site of several industry firsts including starting gates safety helmets and pick six wagering Both Phar Lap and Seabiscuit ran and won the Agua Caliente Handicap which for a time was the richest in North America

Such riders as Aureliano Noguez Humberto Enriquez Francisco Mena Antonio Castanon and David Flores graced the jockeys quarters throughout the days of horse racing

The race track is the originator of the Pick 6 on the North American continent Then known as the 510 and later on the 49er Some racetrackers called it the Big Six

The original grandstand structure was destroyed by fire in 1971 but was rebuilt and continues to operate today though just a shadow of its opulent beginnings It is currently owned by millionaire politician Jorge Hank who renamed it Hipdromo de Agua Caliente It has not hosted horse racing since 1992 but presents greyhound races The building was renovated in the 2010s and the Estadio Caliente stadium was built in the grounds

Memory work
Memory work is a process of engaging with the past which has both an ethical and historical dimension

The premise for memory work or travail de memoire is that history is not memory We try to represent the past in the present through memory history and the archives As Paul Ricoeur argued memory alone is fallible Historical accounts are always partial and potentially misrepresent since historians do not work with bare uninterpreted facts Historians construct and use archives that contain traces of the past However historians and librarians determine which traces are preserved and stored This is an interpretive activity Historians pose questions to which the archives responds leading them to facts that can be asserted in singular discrete propositions that usually include dates places proper names and verbs of action or condition Individuals remember events and experiences some of which they share with a collective Through mutual reconstruction and recounting collective memory is reconstructed Individuals are born into familial discourse which already provides a backdrop of communal memories against which individual memories are shaped A groups communal memory becomes its common knowledge which creates a social bond a sense of belonging and identity Professional historians attempt to corroborate correct or refute collective memory Memory work then entails adding an ethical component which acknowledges the responsibility towards revisiting distorted histories thereby decreasing the risk of social exclusion and increasing the possibility of social cohesion of atrisk groups

The concept of memorywork as distinguished from historyasmemory finds a textbook case in the Vichy Syndrome as described by Rousso His title uses medical lexicon to refer to historymemory as dependent on working consciously with unconscious memories to revise accounts of history This calls for an expanded archive that includes the oral and popular tradition as well as the written traditions normally associated with the archives

Pierre Nora introduced lieu de mmoire about 25 years ago he traced the surge in memory work at the level of the nationstate to the revisiting of distorted histories of the antiSemitic Vichy France 19401944 following the death of Charles de Gaulle in 1970 Structural changes resulted from the end of the peasantry and the dramatic economic slump as oil prices worldwide rose in 1974 Added to this was the intellectual collapse of Marxism precipitated in part by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns Gulag Archipelago which forced the French to rethink attitudes towards the past Lieu de mmoire closed down perspectives to better understand cultural memory instead of opening up perspectives He associated memory with place and location

During memory work the process of producing an image or what we refer to as the production of the imaginary is central Therefore the key in the analysis of remembered history are contradictions

After meeting at Yale University in 1966 Jacques Derrida was a colleague and friend of Paul de Mans until de Mans death in 1983 In 1984 Derrida gave three lectures including one at Yale University on the art of memory In Memoriesfor Paul de Man described the relationship between memory work and deconstruction in this oftencited passage

Barbara Gabriel provided a model for reading the complexities of memory and forgetting by situating unheimlich within the heimlich in a Freudian one within the other structure As point of departure Gabriel examined Edgar Reitzs elevenpart West German television series entitled Heimat Reitz work was in response to a larger movement in Germany national memory work provoked in part by an American television series entitled the Holocaust followed viewed by millions As European art in general and German art in particular resurged in the 1960s artists like Gnter Grass and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided postHolocaust Germany Gabriel developed the concept of an impulse towards national memory work in Germany that stemmed from a haunted subject yearning for a lost far away nostalgic place a utopic homeland How do we confront that which we have excluded in order to be whether it is the return of the repressed or the return of the strangers In other words that which we fear as other is within ourselves through our shared humanity Repressed memories haunt all of us

After attending a memory methodology workshop in Cape Town South Africa in 2005 on forced removal traumas Australian performance artist Tanya Heyward created a performance piece called Site in Melbourne Watch House in 2006 She referred to a burial ground at Prestwich Street Cape Town South Africa with three thousand skeletons dating back to Dutch colonization the largest of its kind in the South Africa

The concept of memory work is part of a sociological imagination from a postnational point of view Expanding on Norbert Loeffler The idea of one national history is only acceptable as a question not as an answer

Memory work is related to identity work often associated with displaced persons Some of the most provocative research on memory work has been authored by the Piednoir or French colonials in Algeria who returned to France following the Algerian War Examples of such thinkers include Jacques Derrida and Hlne Cixous Another major writer in this field Julia Kristeva also moved away from the country of her birth having emigrated to France from Bulgaria when she was 24

California mule deer
The California mule deer Odocoileus hemionus californicus is a subspecies of mule deer whose range covers much of the state of California

One of the principal means of distinguishing the closely related blacktailed deer and whitetailed deer is the growth habit of the bucks antlers In the case of the California mule deer the antlers fork in an upward growth whereas the other species antlers grow in a forward direction

This subspecies O h californicus is widespread throughout northern and central California in the California coastal prairie as well as inner coastal ranges and interior mountains especially the Sierra Nevada This deer is much less frequently found on the floor of the interior valleys and then mostly frequently in riparian zones

Generally the California mule deer has a preference for hill terrain especially an oak woodland habitat It is a browser and typically takes over 90 of its diet from shrubs and leaves and the balance from grasses

California mule deer usually browse close to lakes or streams providing their water From that water source they may roam 12mi and typically make their beds in grassy areas beneath trees within such a onemile radius from both water and forage

Repeatedly used beds often are scratched to a nearly level surface about 2 m in diameter Less regularly used bedding areas are seen as flattened grass On hot summer days California mule deer often seek shade and rest in the midday

In summer California mule deer mainly browse on leaves of small trees shrubs and herbaceous plants but also consume many types of berries including blackberry huckleberry salal and thimbleberry In winter they may expand their forage to conifers particularly twigs of Douglas fir aspen willow dogwood juniper and sage Yearround they feed on acorns grasses are a secondary food source Where humans have encroached on historic deer habitat by suburban development or orchards California mule deer diversify their diet with garden plant material tree fruit and occasionally pet food

Fawns and does tend to forage together in familial groupings while bucks tend to travel singly or with other bucks California mule deer browse most actively near dawn and dusk but also forage at night in open agricultural areas or when experiencing hunting pressure
Rutting season occurs in autumn when the does come into estrus for a period lasting only several days Males exhibit aggressive behavior in competing for mates Does begin estrus again if they do not become pregnant The gestation period is about 200 days with fawns arriving in the spring the young remain with mothers throughout the summer and are weaned in the autumn The bucks antlers fall off in the winter and commence growing once more in spring in anticipation of next autumns rut

Since prehistoric times the Native American indigenous peoples of California are known to have hunted California mule deer Thus since about 12000 BCE Gage suggests that human populations have served as a control to the numbers of California mule deer

In the modern era since European colonists and EuroAmericans settled in California hunting pressure intensified as the human population expanded and hunting became an activity not just associated with food supply In addition human population growth through urban development in California has consumed large amounts of natural habitat of the California mule deer starting in the late 19th century and continuing through the present

David Langford has called it a pleasant little novel and engaging while qualifying it as only just fantasy James Nicoll has cited it as an example of how perception of a book can be affected by historical context noting that when he reread it in 2014 it was still an often charming period piece just not as charming as it was when he originally read it in 1983 in particular he emphasizes that it isnt quite an example of the white savior trope but this book can see white savior from where it is standing Similarly Jo Walton while praising MacAvoys approach to the novels central philosophical questions  states that she remembers being excited by what seems to me today in 2010 to be charming but quite slight and posits that a great deal of the popularity and acclaim came from how lovely it is and the rest of it came from how amazingly unusual it was in 1983 to have a fantasy novel using Chinese mythology and with a Chinese protagonist

Daughters of Abraham
The Daughters of Abraham is an interfaith book group consisting of Jewish Christian and Muslim women Its mission is to overcome stereotypes and to foster mutual respect and understanding among Jewish Christian and Muslim women

The first group was founded in Cambridge Massachusetts United States in 2002 Groups then formed in Cambridge Newton Massachusetts Chestnut Hill Massachusetts at Boston College and Washington DC

The purpose is to increase respect for all of the Abrahamic religions by reading books that teach about faith traditions and the practice of the respective faiths The group members are committed to building relationships with each other Daughters of Abraham is not a dialogue group but a book group focused on discussions of books that explore the three faith traditions

Any Jewish Christian or Muslim woman who shares the Daughters purpose can join

The Daughters of Abraham was the inspiration of Edie Howe She attended an interfaith service on the evening of September 11 2001 and sat with Jewish Christian and Muslim women Looking around she wondered what she could do to respond to the tragic events of that day She decided to form a book group of women from the three Abrahamic faiths This first group has been meeting since September 2002

In all three of the religious traditions Abraham is revered as the first monotheist In this sense he is the father and the members can be thought of as his daughters Even though they are daughters of different mothers Sarah and Hagar Abraham is the father of all three religions By naming themselves Abrahams daughters the group members are saying that there is more holding them together than separating them

Group members listen and speak respectfully to one another do not to monopolize the conversation and speak from personal experience rather than making sweeping statements

Members suggest books at the meetings Periodically they review all the suggestions then by consensus choose the books that will be read If anyone strongly objects to reading a particular book it is not read

He died of a brain tumor in 1991

Following his brief stay at Duke University Castaedas first fulltime academic appointment was as a professor in the Philosophy department at Wayne State University where he taught from 19571969 It was there that he founded the philosophical journal Nos in 1967 From 19621963 he was also a visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin He was granted a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation between 1967 and 1968

Castaeda started from the fact that thoughts about real things in the world are of a fundamentally similar nature to thoughts about things in the imagination it is still a thought and from there he hypothesized an entire realm of abstract objects that included both the real and the imagined He referred to these objects collectively as guises and argued that they could be treated as sets of properties He went on to analyse all of language and perception in terms of these guises ultimately developing an entire metaphysics based on them

One noted critic of guise theory was Plantinga who developed his own rival theory involving a realm of abstract objects Both theories were in fact based on even earlier work developed by Ernst Mally in 1912 They differed however in the details of their metaphysical system and in how they regarded the basic building blocks of their respective systems

HLAC
HLAC belongs to the MHC human  HLA class I heavy chain receptors The C receptor is a heterodimer consisting of a HLAC mature gene product and 2microglobulin The mature C chain is anchored in the membrane MHC Class I molecules like HLAC are expressed in nearly all cells and present small peptides to the immune system which surveys for nonself peptides

HLAC is a locus on chromosome 6 which encodes for a large number of HLAC alleles that are ClassI MHC receptors HLAC localized proximal to the HLAB locus is located on the distal end of the HLA region Most HLACB haplotypes are in strong linkage disequilibrium and many are as ancient as the human species itself

Charles F Hurley
Charles Francis Hurley November 24 1893  March 24 1946 was the 54th Governor of the US state of Massachusetts and one of its first IrishAmerican governors

Charles Francis Hurley was born in Cambridge Massachusetts to John and Elizabeth Maker Hurley He attended public schools in Cambridge then Boston College High School and then studied for two years at Boston College He became a salesman for athletic goods and entered the United States Navy in the First World War serving in a radio intelligence unit stationed at Harvard University After the war Hurley entered the real estate business in partnership with James M Conley In 1924 he married Conleys daughter Marion the couple had five children

Hurleys entry into politics was in 1919 when he won election to the Cambridge school committee on which he served until 1931 
Governor Hurleys administration was a brief departure from the increasing ethnic conflict between Yankee Protestants and IrishAmerican Catholics in political machines party control and business influence which had marked the states early 20th century history In 1930 he ran as a Democrat for the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer winning three consecutive twoyear terms In 1936 he won the nomination for Governor James Michael Curley the Democratic incumbent was seeking a Senate seat and then won the general election defeating Republican John W Haigis

As a result of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th century the predominant power of the native American classes had first eroded in Boston and then the state with brief checks and restoration of Yankee power in the interim While Irish immigration had been reduced to a trickle with the Immigration Act of 1924 further immigration was negligible and the state turned to a process of assimilation and competition between the two groups for remaining power Hurley represented the more legitimate side to Irish American politics and he attempted to prove the Americanization of his ethnic community by turning away from ethnic spoils which had marked his previous predecessors Included amongst his program of cleaning up the civil service were the regulation of labor practices and emphasis on individual rights 

During Governor Hurleys administration the Fair Trades Laws were passed which regulated the use of private police in strikes imposed a minimum wage for women and children and further regulated industrial work While these practices endeared him to both ethnic groups his administration also marked a departure from past practices with its increasing liberalism Although both Yankee and Irish American voters had favored it he vetoed a law to require teachers to take loyalty oaths Additionally he raised the ire of Georgias Governor Eurith D Rivers by refusing to extradite James Cunningham who had escaped from a Georgia chain gang thirteen years earlier Hurley further upset Yankee and Irish interests which had a long tradition of local representative democracy when he also approved a fifth form of municipal government in Massachusetts called Plan E This allowed for an appointed city manager and a city council drawn from a proportional representation of the vote rather than a collection of majority elected precinct candidates Yankee interests in several cities such as Boston had cherished their old Charter government from both historical precedence and the ability of ward representatives in protecting their interests in the majority Irish American city The later in turn had long used the form of government in defending their interests when they were a minority and saw its abolition as a direct threat to their way of conducting business

Faced with a reinvigorated Yankee political machine and a loss of support amongst his own constituents particularly the still powerful Irish mob Hurley was denied reelection when former Governor Curley won the 1938 Democratic gubernatorial nomination

He returned to private life serving as a trustee of the Cambridge Public Library from 1941 until his death He died on March 24 1946

The Charles F Hurley Building in Bostons Government Center complex is named after him

Criticism of communist party rule
The actions by governments of communist states have been subject to criticism According to critics the rule by Communist parties leads to totalitarianism political repression restrictions of human rights poor economic performance and cultural and artistic censorship

After the Russian Revolution communist party rule was consolidated for the first time in Soviet Russia later the largest constituent republic of the Soviet Union formed in December 1922 and criticized immediately domestically and internationally During the first Red Scare in the United States the takeover of Russia by the communist Bolsheviks was considered by many a threat to free markets religious freedom and liberal democracy Meanwhile under the tutelage of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union the only party permitted by the Soviet Union constitution state institutions were intimately entwined with those of the party By the late 1920s Joseph Stalin consolidated the regimes control over the countrys economy and society through a system of economic planning and fiveyear plans

Between the Russian Revolution and the Second World War Sovietstyle communist rule only spread to one state that was not later incorporated into the Soviet Union In 1924 communist rule was established in neighboring Mongolia a traditional outpost of Russian influence bordering the Siberian region However throughout much of Europe and the Americas criticism of the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet regime among anticommunists continued unabated After the end of World War II Soviet Union took control over the territories reached by the Red Army establishing what later became known as Eastern Bloc

Following the Chinese Revolution the Peoples Republic of China was proclaimed in 1949 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Between the Chinese Revolution and the last quarter of the 20th century communist rule spread throughout East Asia and much of the Third World and new communist regimes became the subject of extensive local and international criticism

Western criticisms of the Soviet Union and Third World communist regimes have been strongly anchored in scholarship on totalitarianism which asserts that communist parties maintain themselves in power without the consent of the populations and they rule by means of secret police propaganda disseminated through the statecontrolled mass media repression of free discussion and criticism mass surveillance and state terror These studies of totalitarianism influenced Western historiography on communism and Soviet history particularly the work of Robert Conquest and Richard Pipes on Stalinism the Great Purge the Gulag and the Soviet famine of 19321933 Western criticisms of communist rule have also been grounded in criticisms of socialism by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman who argued that the state ownership and economic planning characteristic of Sovietstyle communist rule were responsible for economic stagnation and shortage economies providing few incentives for individuals to improve productivity and engage in entrepreneurship

Ruling communist parties have also been challenged by domestic dissent In Eastern Europe the works of dissidents Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Vclav Havel gained international prominence as did the works of disillusioned excommunists such as Milovan Djilas who condemned the new class or nomenklatura system that had emerged under communist rule Communism Promise and Practice 1973 detailed what its author termed flagrant gaps between official Soviet policies of equality and economic justice and the reality of the emergence of a new class in the Soviet Union and in other communist countries which thrived at the expense of the remaining population

Criticisms of communist regimes have centered on many topics including their effects on the economic development human rights foreign policy scientific progress and environmental degradation of the countries they rule

Political repression is a topic in many influential works critical of communist rule including Robert Conquests accounts of Stalins Great Purge in The Great Terror and the Soviet famine of 19321933 in The Harvest of Sorrow Richard Pipes account of the Red Terror during the Russian Civil War RJ Rummels work on democide Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns account of Stalins forced labor camps in The Gulag Archipelago and Stphane Courtois account of executions forced labor camps and mass starvation in communist regimes as a general category with particular attention to the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin and China under Mao Zedong

Sovietstyle central planning and state ownership has been another topic of criticism of communist rule Works by economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman argue that the economic structures associated with communist rule resulted in economic stagnation Other topics of criticism of communist rule include foreign policies of expansionism environmental degradation and the suppression of free cultural expression

Largescale political repression under communist rule has been the subject of extensive historical research by scholars and activists from a diverse range of perspectives A number of researchers on this subject are former Eastern bloc communists who become disillusioned with their ruling parties such as Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev and Dmitri Volkogonov Similarly Jung Chang one of the authors of  was a Red Guard in her youth Others are disillusioned former Western communists including several of the authors of The Black Book of Communism Robert Conquest another former communist became one of the bestknown writers on the Soviet Union following the publication of his influential account of the Great Purge in The Great Terror which at first was not well received in some leftleaning circles of Western intellectuals Following the end of the Cold War much of the research on this topic has focused on state archives previously classified under communist rule

The level of political repression experienced in states under communist rule varied widely between different countries and historical periods The most rigid censorship was practiced by the Soviet Union under Stalin 19221953 China under Mao during the Cultural Revolution 19661976 and the communist regime in North Korea throughout its rule 1948present Under Stalins rule political repression in the Soviet Union included executions of Great Purge victims and peasants deemed kulaks by state authorities the Gulag system of forced labor camps deportations of ethnic minorities and mass starvations during the Soviet famine of 19321933 caused by either government mismanagement or by some accounts caused deliberately The Black Book of Communism also details the mass starvations resulting from Great Leap Forward in China and the Killing Fields in Cambodia

Although political repression in the Soviet Union was far more extensive and severe in its methods under Stalins rule than in any other period authors such as Richard Pipes Orlando Figes and works such as the Black Book of Communism argue that a reign of terror began within Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin immediately after the October Revolution and continued by the Red Army and the Cheka over the country during the Russian Civil War It included summary executions of hundreds of thousands of class enemies by Cheka the development of the system of labor camps which would later lay the foundation for the Gulags and a policy of food requisitioning during the civil war which was partially responsible for a famine causing three to ten million deaths

Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlevs critiques of political repression under communist rule focus on the treatment of children which he numbers in the millions of alleged political opponents His accounts stress cases in which children of former imperial officers and peasants were held as hostages and sometimes shot during the civil war His account of the Second World War highlights cases in which the children of soldiers who had surrendered were the victims of state reprisal Some children Yakovlev notes followed their parents to the Gulags suffering an especially high mortality rate According to Yakovlev in 1954 there were 884057 specially resettled children under the age of sixteen Others were placed in special orphanages run by the secret police in order to be reeducated often losing even their names and were considered socially dangerous as adults

Other accounts focus on extensive networks of civilian informants consisting of either volunteers or those forcibly recruited These networks were used to collect intelligence for the government and report cases of dissent Many accounts of political repression in the Soviet Union highlight cases in which internal critics were classified as mentally ill suffering from disorders such as sluggishly progressing schizophrenia and incarcerated in mental hospitals The fact that workers in the Soviet Union were not allowed to organize independent nonstate trade union has also been presented as a case of political repression in the Soviet Union

Various accounts stressing a relationship between political repression and communist rule focus on the suppression of internal uprisings by military force such as the Tambov rebellion and the Kronstadt rebellion during the Russian Civil War and the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in China

Excommunist dissident Milovan Djilas among others focused on the relationship between political repression and the rise of a powerful new class of party bureaucrats that had emerged under communist rule and exploited the rest of the population see nomenklatura

Both anticommunists and communists have criticized the personality cults of many communist rulers especially the cults of Stalin Mao Fidel Castro and Kim Ilsung In the case of North Korea the personality cult of Kim Ilsung was associated with inherited leadership with the succession of Kims son Kim Jongil in 1994 and grandson Kim Jongun in 2011 Cuban communists have also been criticized for planning an inherited leadership with the succession of Ral Castro following his brothers illness in mid2006

In the literature on communist rule many anticommunists have asserted that communist regimes tend to impose harsh restrictions on the freedom of movement These restrictions they argue are meant to stem the possibility of mass emigration which threatens to offer evidence pointing to widespread popular dissatisfaction with their rule

Between 1950 and 1961 275 million East Germans moved to West Germany During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 around 200000 people moved to Austria as the HungarianAustrian border temporarily opened From 1948 to 1953 hundreds of thousands of North Koreans moved to the South stopped only when emigration was clamped down after the Korean War

In Cuba 50000 middleclass Cubans left between 1959 and 1961 after the Cuban Revolution and the breakdown of CubanAmerican relations Following a period of repressive measures by the Cuban government in the late 1960s and 1970s Cuba allowed for mass emigration of dissatisfied citizens a policy that resulted in the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 which led to a drop in emigration rates during the later months In the 1990s the economic crisis known as the Special Period coupled with the United States tightening of the embargo led to desperate attempts to leave the island on balsas rafts tires and makeshift vessels Many Cubans currently continue attempts to emigrate to the United States In total according to some estimates more than 1 million people have left Cuba around 10 of the population Between 1971 and 1998 547000 Cubans emigrated to the United States alongside 700000 neighboring Dominicans 335000 Haitians and 485000 Jamaicans Since 1966 immigration to the United States was governed by the 1966 Cuban adjustment act a United States law that applies solely to Cubans The ruling allows any Cuban national no matter the means of the entry into the United States to receive a green card after being in the country a year Havana has long argued that the policy has encouraged the illegal exodus deliberately ignoring and undervaluing the lifethreatening hardships endured by refugees

After the victory of the communist North in the Vietnam War over 2 million people in former South Vietnamese territory left the country see Vietnamese boat people in the 1970s and 1980s Another large group of refugees left Cambodia and Laos

Restrictions on emigration from states ruled by communist parties received extensive publicity In the West the Berlin wall emerged as a symbol of such restrictions During the Berlin Walls existence sixty thousand people unsuccessfully attempted to emigrate illegally from East Germany and received jail terms for such actions there were around five thousand successful escapes into West Berlin and 239 people were killed trying to cross

North Korea currently imposes strict restrictions on emigration

Albania and North Korea perhaps imposed the most extreme restrictions on emigration From most other communist regimes legal emigration was always possible though often so difficult that attempted emigrants would risk their lives in order to emigrate Some of these states relaxed emigration laws significantly from the 1960s onwards Tens of thousands of Soviet citizens emigrated legally every year during the 1970s

The Chinese government takes these restrictions even further by restriction of movement within their own borders Workers in rural areas must obtain permission to obtain work at factories within urban areas Many rural citizens especially young men facing lack of education and other services that are provided free of charge to people living in cities and urban areas choose to obtain underthetable work in urban areas where there are labor shortages leading to an illegal immigration problem within the country These restrictions are not for the political reasons other regimes have used but to maintain the central government planned economy and caste system that seeks to retain the knowledge and skills needed in different fields of the economy Agriculture Industry Fishing etc One belief is that China is trying to reduce overpopulation of urban areas and avoid the loss of specialized skills usually passed from generation to generation in the traditional fields

As an ideology MarxismLeninism stresses militant opposition to imperialism Vladimir Lenin considered imperialism the highest stage of capitalism and in 1917 made declarations of the unconditional right of selfdetermination and secession for the national minorities of Russia Later during the Cold War communist states exercised imperialism by giving military assistance and in some cases intervening directly on behalf of Communist movements that were fighting for control particularly in Asia and Africa

Western critics accused the Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China of practicing imperialism themselves and communist condemnations of Western imperialism hypocritical The attack on and restoration of Moscows control of countries that had been under the rule of the tsarist empire but briefly formed newly independent states in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War including Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan have been condemned as examples of Soviet imperialism Similarly Stalins forced reassertion of Moscows rule of the Baltic states in World War II has been condemned as Soviet imperialism Western critics accused Stalin of creating satellite states in Eastern Europe after the end of World War II Western critics also condemned the intervention of Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution the Prague Spring and the war in Afghanistan as aggression against popular uprisings Maoists argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist faade social imperialism Chinas reassertion of central control over territories on the frontiers of the Qing dynasty particularly Tibet has also been condemned as imperialistic by some

According to Richard Pipes the Soviet Union shares some responsibility for World War II Pipes argues that both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini used the Soviet Union as a model for their own regimes and that Hitler privately considered Stalin a genius According to Pipes Stalin privately hoped that another world war would weaken his foreign enemies and allow him to assert Soviet power internationally Before Hitler took power Stalin allowed the testing and production of German weapons that were forbidden by the Versailles Treaty to occur on Soviet territory Stalin is also accused of weakening German opposition to the Nazis before Hitlers rule began in 1933 During the 1932 German elections for instance he forbade the German Communists from collaborating with the Social Democrats These parties together gained more votes than Hitler and some have later surmised could have prevented him from becoming Chancellor

Some states under communist rule have been criticized for directly supporting terrorist groups such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine the Red Army Faction and the Japanese Red Army North Korea has been implicated in terrorist acts such as Korean Air Flight 858

A number of communist states also held forced labor as a legal form of punishment for certain periods of time and again critics of these policies assert that many of those sentenced to forced labor camps such as the Gulag were sent there for political rather than criminal reasons Some of the Gulag camps were located in very harsh environments such as Siberia which resulted in the death of a significant fraction of inmates before they could complete their prison terms Officially the Gulag was shut down in 1960 though they remained de facto in action for some time after

Many deaths were also caused by involuntary deportations of entire ethnic groups see population transfer in the Soviet Union Many Prisoners of War taken during World War II were not released as the war ended and died in the Gulags Many German civilians died as a result of atrocities committed by the Soviet army see Evacuation of East Prussia and due to the policy of ethnic cleansing of Germans from the territories they lost due to the war see expulsion of Germans after World War II

North Korea continues to maintain a network of prison and labor camps that imprison an estimated 200000 people While the country does not regularly deport citizens there is a system of internal exile and banishment

Scholars such as Stephane Courtois Steven Rosefielde in Red Holocaust Banjamin Valentino and RJ Rummel have argued that communist regimes were responsible for tens or even hundreds of millions of deaths These deaths mostly occurred under the rule of Stalin and Mao therefore these particular periods of communist rule in Russia and China receive considerable attention in The Black Book of Communism though other communist regimes have also caused high number of deaths not least the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia which is often acclaimed to have killed more of its citizens than any other in history

These accounts often divide their death toll estimates into two categories

In most communist states the death penalty was a legal form of punishment for most of their existence with a few exceptions The Soviet Union for example formally abolished the death penalty between 1947 and 1950 though this did nothing to curb executions and acts of genocide Critics argue that many of the convicted prisoners executed by authorities under communist rule were not criminals but political dissidents Stalins Great Purge in the late 1930s from roughly 19361938 is given as the most prominent example of the hypothesis

With regard to deaths not caused directly by state or party authorities The Black Book of Communism points to famine and war as the indirect causes of what they see as deaths for which communist regimes were responsible In this sense the Soviet famine of 19321933 and the Great Leap Forward are often described as manmade famines These two events alone killed a majority of the people seen as victims of communist states by estimates such as Courtois Courtois also blames Mengistu Haile Mariams regime in Ethiopia for having exacerbated the 19831985 famine by imposing unreasonable political and economic burdens on the population

The authors of the Black Book of Communism RJ Rummel Norman Davies and others have attempted to give estimates of the total number of deaths for which communist rule of a particular state in a particular period was responsible or the total for all states under communist rule The question is complicated by the lack of hard data and by biases inherent in any estimation

The number of people killed under Joseph Stalins rule in the Soviet Union by 1939 has been estimated as 358 million by G Ponton 66 million by VV Tsaplin and 1011 million by Alec Nove The number of people killed under Stalins rule by the time of his death in 1953 has been estimated as 13 million by Stephen G Wheatcroft 69 million by Timothy D Snyder 1320 million by Steven Rosefielde 20 million by The Black Book of Communism 20 to 25 million by Alexander Yakovlev 43 million by RJ Rummel and 50 million by Norman Davies

The number of people killed under Maos rule in the Peoples Republic of China has been estimated at 195 million by Wang Weizhi 27 million by John Heidenrich between 38 and 67 million by Kurt Glaser and Stephan Possony between 32 and 59 million by Robert L Walker 50 million by Steven Rosefielde 65 million by The Black Book of Communism well over 70 million by  and 77 million by RJ Rummel

The authors of The Black Book of Communism have also estimated that 93 million people were killed under communist rule in other states 2 million in North Korea 2 million in Cambodia 17 million in Africa 15 million in Afghanistan 1 million in Vietnam 1 million in Eastern Europe and 150000 in Latin America RJ Rummel has estimated that 17 million were killed by the government of Vietnam 16 million in North Korea not counting the 1990s famine 2 million in Cambodia and 25 million in Poland and Yugoslavia Valentino estimates that 1 to 2 million were killed in Cambodia 50000 to 100000 in Bulgaria 80000 to 100000 in East Germany 60000 to 300000 in Romania 400000 to 1500000 in North Korea and 80000 to 200000 in North and South Vietnam

Between the authors Wiezhi Heidenrich Glaser Possony Ponton Tsaplin and Nove Stalins Soviet Union and Maos China have an estimated total death rate ranging from 23 million to 109 million

The Black Book of Communism asserts that roughly 94 million died under all communist regimes while Rummel believes around 1447 million died under six communist regimes Benjamin Valentino claims that between 21 and 70 million deaths are attributable to the Communist regimes in the Soviet Union the Peoples Republic of China and Democratic Kampuchea alone

Jasper Becker author of Hungry Ghosts claims that if the death tolls from the famines caused by communist regimes in China the Soviet Union Cambodia North Korea Ethiopia and Mozambique are added together the figure could be close to 90 million

These estimates are the three highest numbers of victims blamed on communism by any notable study However the totals that include research by Wiezhi Heidenrich Glasser Possony Ponton Tsaplin and Nove do not include other periods of time beyond Stalin or Maos rule thus it may possible when including other communist states to reach higher totals

In a January 25 2006 resolution condemning the crimes of communist regimes the Council of Europe cited the 94 million total reached by the authors of the Black Book of Communism

Explanations have been offered for the discrepancies in the number of estimated victims of communist regimes

Both critics and supporters of communist rule often make comparisons between the economic development of countries under communist rule and noncommunist countries with the intention of certain economic structures are superior to the other All such comparisons are open to challenge both on the comparability of the states involved and the statistics being used for comparison No two countries are identical which makes comparisons regarding later economic development difficult Western Europe was more developed and industrialized than Eastern Europe long before the Cold War World War II damaged the economies of some countries more than others and East Germany had much of its industry dismantled and moved to the Soviet Union for war reparations

Advocates of Sovietstyle economic planning have claimed the system has in certain instances produced dramatic advances including rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union especially during the 1930s Critics of Soviet economic planning in response assert that new research shows that the Soviet figures were partly fabricated especially those showing extremely high growth in the Stalin era Growth was impressive in the 1950s and 1960s in some estimates much higher than during the 1930s but later declined and according to some estimates became negative in the late 1980s Before collectivization Russia had been the breadbasket of Europe Afterwards the Soviet Union became a net importer of grain unable to produce enough food to feed its own population

China and Vietnam achieved much higher rates of growth after introducing market reforms see socialism with Chinese characteristics starting in the late 1970s and 1980shigher growth rates were accompanied by declining poverty

The communist states do not compare favorably when looking at nations divided by the Cold War North Korea versus South Korea and East Germany versus West Germany East German productivity relative to West German productivity was around 90 percent in 1936 and around 6065 percent in 1954 When compared to Western Europe East German productivity declined from 67 percent in 1950 to 50 percent before the reunification in 1990 All the Eastern European national economies had productivity far below the Western European average

Nevertheless some countries under communist rule with socialist economies maintained consistently higher rates of economic growth than industrialized Western countries with capitalist economies From 1928 to 1985 the economy of the Soviet Union grew by a factor of 10 and GNP per capita grew more than fivefold The Soviet economy started out at roughly 25 percent the size of the economy of the United States By 1955 it climbed to 40 percent In 1965 the Soviet economy reached 50 of the contemporary United States economy and in 1977 it passed the 60 percent threshold For the first half of the Cold War most economists were asking when not if the Soviet economy would overtake the United States economy Starting in the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s growth rates slowed down in the Soviet Union and throughout the socialist bloc The reasons for this downturn are still a matter of debate among economists but one hypothesis is that the socialist planned economies had reached the limits of the extensive growth model they were pursuing and the downturn was at least in part caused by their refusal or inability to switch to intensive growth Further it could be argued that since the economies of countries such as Russia were preindustrial before the socialist revolutions the high economic growth rate could be attributed to industrialization Also while forms of economic growth associated with any economic structure produce some winners and losers anticommunists point out that high growth rates under communist rule were associated with particularly intense suffering and even mass starvation of the peasant population
Unlike the slow market reforms in China and Vietnam where communist rule continues the abrupt end to central planning was followed by a depression in many of the states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which chose to adopt the socalled economic shock therapy For example in the Russian Federation GDP per capita decreased by onethird between 1989 and 1996 As of 2003 all of them have positive economic growth and almost all have a higher GDPcapita than before the transition

In general critics of communist rule argue that socialist economies remained behind the industrialized West in terms of economic development for most of their existence while others assert that socialist economies had growth rates that were sometimes higher than many nonsocialist economies so they would have eventually caught up to the West if those growth rates had been maintained Some reject all comparisons altogether noting that the communist states started out with economies that were generally much less developed to begin with

Starting with the first fiveyear plan in the Soviet Union in the late 1920s and early 1930s Soviet leaders pursued a strategy of economic development concentrating the countrys economic resources on heavy industry and defense rather than on consumer goods This strategy was later adopted in varying degrees by communist leaders in Eastern Europe and the Third World For many Western critics of communist strategies of economic development the unavailability of consumer goods common in the West in the Soviet Union was a case in point of how communist rule resulted in lower standards of living

The allegation that communist rule resulted in lower standards of living sharply contrasted with communist arguments boasting of the achievements of the social and cultural programs of the Soviet Union and other communist states For instance Soviet leaders boasted of guaranteed employment subsidized food and clothing free health care free child care and free education Soviet leaders also touted early advances in womens equality particularly in Islamic areas of Soviet Central Asia Eastern European communists often touted high levels of literacy in comparison with many parts of the developing world A phenomenon called Ostalgie nostalgia for life under Soviet rule has been noted amongst former members of Communist countries now living in Western capitalist states particularly those who lived in the former East Germany

However the effects of communist rule on living standards have been harshly criticized Jung Chang stresses that millions died in famines in communist China and North Korea Some studies conclude that East Germans were shorter than West Germans probably due to differences in factors such as nutrition and medical services According to some researchers life satisfaction increased in East Germany after the reunification Critics of Soviet rule charge that the Soviet education system was full of propaganda and of low quality United States government researchers pointed out the fact that the Soviet Union spent far less on health care than Western nations and noted that the quality of Soviet health care was deteriorating in the 1970s and 1980s In addition the failure of Soviet pension and welfare programs to provide adequate protection was noted in the West

After 1965 life expectancy began to plateau or even decrease especially for males in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe while it continued to increase in Western Europe This divergence between two parts of Europe continued over the course of three decades leading to a profound gap in the mid1990s Life expectancy sharply declined after the change to market economy in most of the states of the former Soviet Union but may now have started to increase in the Baltic states In several Eastern European nations life expectancy started to increase immediately after the fall of communism The previous decline for males continued for a time in some Eastern European nations like Romania before starting to increase

In The Politics of Bad Faith David Horowitz painted a picture of horrendous living standards in the Soviet Union Horowitz claimed that in the 1980s rationing of meat and sugar was common in the Soviet Union Horowitz cited studies suggesting the average intake of red meat for a Soviet citizen was half of what it had been for a subject of the tsar in 1913 that blacks under apartheid in South Africa owned more cars per capita and that the average welfare mother in the United States received more income in a month than the average Soviet worker could earn in a year According to Horowitz the only area of consumption in which the Soviets excelled was the ingestion of hard liquor Horowitz also noted that twothirds of the households had no hot water and a third had no running water at all Horowitz cited the government newspaper Izvestia noting a typical workingclass family of four was forced to live for eight years in a single eight by eight foot room before marginally better accommodation became available In his discussion of the Soviet housing shortage Horowitz stated that the shortage was so acute that at all times 17 percent of Soviet families had to be physically separated for want of adequate space A third of the hospitals had no running water and the bribery of doctors and nurses to get decent medical attention and even amenities like blankets in Soviet hospitals was not only common but routine In his discussion of Soviet education Horowitz stated that only 15 percent of Soviet youth were able to attend institutions of higher learning compared to 34 percent in the United States However large segments of citizens of many former communist today states say that the standard of living has fallen since the end of the Cold War with majorities of citizens in the former East Germany and Romania were polled as saying that life was better under Communism

In terms of living standards economist Michael Ellman asserts that in international comparisons state socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy Amartya Sens own analysis of international comparisons of life expectancy found that several communist countries made significant gains and commented one thought that is bound to occur is that communism is good for poverty removal Poverty exploded following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 tripling to more than onethird of Russias population in just three years

Criticisms of communist rule have often centered on the censorship of the arts In the case of the Soviet Union these criticisms often deal with the preferential treatment afforded to socialist realism Other criticisms center on the largescale cultural experiments of certain communist regimes In Romania the historical center of Bucharest was demolished and the whole city was redesigned between 1977 and 1989 In the Soviet Union hundreds of churches were demolished or converted to secular purposes during the 1920s and 1930s In China the Cultural Revolution sought to give all artistic expression a proletarian content and destroyed much older material lacking this Advocates of these policies promised to create a new culture that would be superior to the old while critics argue that such policies represented an unjustifiable destruction of the cultural heritage of humanity

There is a wellknown literature focusing on the role of the falsification of images in the Soviet Union under Stalin In The Commissar Vanishes The Falsification of Photographs in Stalins Russia David King writes So much falsification took place during the Stalin years that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs Under Stalin historical documents were often the subject of revisionism and forgery intended to change public perception of certain important people and events For example the pivotal role played by Leon Trotsky in the Russian Revolution and Civil War was almost entirely erased from official historical records after Trotsky became the leader of a Communist faction that opposed Stalins rule

The emphasis on the hard sciences of the Soviet Union has been criticized There were very few Nobel Prize winners from Communist states

Soviet research in certain sciences was at times guided by political rather than scientific considerations Lysenkoism and Japhetic theory were promoted for brief periods of time in biology and linguistics respectively despite having no scientific merit Research into genetics was restricted because Nazi use of eugenics had prompted the Soviet Union to label genetics a fascist science Research was also suppressed in cybernetics psychology and psychiatry and even organic chemistry see suppressed research in the Soviet Union

Soviet technology in many sectors lagged Western technology Exceptions include areas like the Soviet space program and military technology where occasionally Communist technology was more advanced due to a massive concentration of research resources According to the Central Intelligence Agency much of the technology in the Communist states consisted simply of copies of Western products that had been legally purchased or gained through a massive espionage program Some even say that stricter Western control of the export of technology through the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls and providing defective technology to Communist agents after the discovery of the Farewell Dossier contributed to the fall of Communism

Other criticisms of Communist rule focus on environmental disasters One example is the gradual disappearance of the Aral Sea and a similar diminishing of the Caspian Sea because of the diversion of the rivers that fed them Another is the pollution of the Black Sea the Baltic Sea and the unique freshwater environment of Lake Baikal Many of the rivers were polluted and several like the Vistula and Oder rivers in Poland were virtually ecologically dead Over 70 percent of the surface water in the Soviet Union was polluted In 1988 only 30 percent of the sewage in the Soviet Union was treated properly Established health standards for air pollution was exceeded by ten times or more in 103 cities in the Soviet Union in 1988 The air pollution problem was even more severe in Eastern Europe It caused a rapid growth in lung cancer forest dieback and damage to buildings and cultural heritages According to official sources 58 percent of total agricultural land of the former Soviet Union was affected by salinization erosion acidity or waterlogging Nuclear waste was dumped in the Sea of Japan the Arctic Ocean and in locations in the Far East It was revealed in 1992 that in the city of Moscow there were 636 radioactive toxic waste sites and 1500 in Saint Petersburg According to the United States Department of Energy socialist economies also maintained a much higher level of energy intensity than either the Western nations or the Third World This analysis is confirmed by the Institute of Economic Affairs with Mikhail Bernstam stating that economies of the Eastern Bloc had an energy intensity between twice and three times higher as economies of the West Some see the aforementioned examples of environmental degradation are similar to what had occurred in Western capitalist countries during the height of their drive to industrialize in the 19th century Others claim that Communist regimes did more damage than average primarily due to the lack of any popular or political pressure to research environmentally friendly technologies

Some ecological problems continue unabated after the fall of the Soviet Union and are still major issues today which has prompted supporters of former ruling Communist parties to accuse their opponents of holding a double standard However other environmental problems have improved in every studied former Communist state Some researchers have argued that part of improvement was largely due to the severe economic downturns in the 1990s that caused many factories to close down

Communist countries states areas and local communities have been based on the rule of parties proclaiming a basis in MarxismLeninism an ideology which is not supported by all Marxists and leftists Many communists disagree with many of the actions undertaken by ruling Communist parties during the 20th century

Elements of the left opposed to Bolshevik plans before they were put into practice included the revisionist Marxists such as Eduard Bernstein who denied the necessity of a revolution Anarchists who had differed from Marx and his followers since the split in the First International many of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Marxist Mensheviks supported the overthrow of the tsar but vigorously opposed the seizure of power by Lenin and the Bolsheviks

Criticisms of Communist rule from the left continued after the creation of the Soviet state The anarchist Nestor Makhno led the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and the Socialist Revolutionary Fanya Kaplan tried to assassinate Lenin Bertrand Russell visited Russia in 1920 and regarded the Bolsheviks as intelligent but clueless and planless In her books about Soviet Russia after the revolution My Disillusionment in Russia and My Further Disillusionment in Russia Emma Goldman condemned the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion as a massacre Eventually the Left Socialist Revolutionaries broke with the Bolsheviks

Antirevisionists which includes radical MarxistLeninist factions Hoxhaists and Maoists criticize the rule of the communist states by claiming that they were state capitalist states ruled by revisionists Though the periods and countries defined as state capitalist or revisionist varies among different ideologies and parties all of them accept that the Soviet Union was socialist during Stalins time Maoists believe that the Peoples Republic of China became state capitalist after Maos death Hoxhaists believe that the Peoples Republic of China was always state capitalist and uphold Socialist Albania as the only socialist state after the Soviet Union under Stalin

Left communists claim that the communist or socialist states or peoples states were actually state capitalist and thus cannot be called socialist Some of the earliest critics of Leninism were the GermanDutch left communists including Herman Gorter Anton Pannekoek and Paul Mattick Though most left communists see the October Revolution positively their analysis concludes that by the time of the Kronstadt revolt the revolution had degenerated due to various historical factors Rosa Luxemburg was another communist who disagreed with Lenins organizational methods which eventually led to the creation of the Soviet Union

Amadeo Bordiga wrote about his view of the Soviet Union as a capitalist society In contrast to those produced by the Trotskyists Bordigas writings on the capitalist nature of the Soviet economy also focused on the agrarian sector Being the engineer that he was Bordiga displayed a kind of theoretical rigidity which was both exasperating and effective in allowing him to see things differently He wanted to show how capitalist social relations existed in the kolkhoz and in the sovkhoz one a cooperative farm and the other the straight wagelabor state farm He emphasized how much of agrarian production depended on the small privately owned plots he was writing in 1950 and predicted quite accurately the rates at which the Soviet Union would start importing wheat after Russia had been such a large exporter from the 1880s to 1914 In Bordigas conception Stalin and later Mao Ho Chi Minh and Che Guevara were great romantic revolutionaries in the 19th century sense ie bourgeois revolutionaries He felt that the Stalinist regimes that came into existence after 1945 were just extending the bourgeois revolution ie the expropriation of the Prussian Junker class by the Red Army through their agrarian policies and through the development of the productive forces

After the split between Leon Trotsky and Stalin Trotskyists have argued that Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into a bureaucratic and repressive oneparty state and that all subsequent Communist states ultimately followed a similar path because they copied Stalinism There are various terms used by Trotskyists to define such states such as degenerated workers state and deformed workers state state capitalist or bureaucratic collectivist While Trotskyists are Leninists there are other Marxists who reject Leninism entirely arguing for example that the Leninist principle of democratic centralism was the source of the Soviet Unions slide away from communism Maoists view the Soviet Union and most of its satellites as state capitalist as a result of destalinization and some of them also view modern China in this light

Groshong line
A Groshong line is a type of both tunneled or nontunneled intravenous catheter used for central venous access

Groshongs may be left in place for extended periods and are used when longterm intravenous therapy is needed such as for chemotherapy Similar to the Hickman line the tip of the catheter is in the superior vena cava and the catheter is tunneled under the skin to an incision on the chest wall where the distal end of the catheter exits the body

In contrast to the Hickman line the tip of a Groshong line has a threeway valve which is formed by a slit in the sidewall of the catheter tip The valve opens outward during infusion and opens inward during blood aspiration When not being accessed the valve remains closed

The insertion of a central Groshong line is usually done under local anesthetic by a interventional anaesthesiologist interventional radiologist or surgeon Throughout the procedure ultrasound and Xrays may be used to confirm placement When a central venous catheter is inserted a chest radiologic examination is usually performed to confirm the position of the catheter and absence of pneumothorax The chest radiologic examination is integral to the procedure

Joseph B Ely
Joseph Buell Ely February 22 1881  June 13 1956 was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Massachusetts As a conservative Democrat Ely was active in party politics from the late 1910s helping to build in conjunction with David I Walsh the Democratic coalition that would gain an enduring political ascendancy in the state From 1931 to 1935 he served as the 52nd Governor He was opposed to the federal expansion of the New Deal and was a prominent intraparty voice in opposition to the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt In 1944 he made a brief unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination

Joseph Buell Ely was born in Westfield Massachusetts to Henry Wilson Ely and Sarah Naomi Buell Ely His grandfather Joseph Miner Ely was one of the founders of Westfields important whip industry and his father a lawyer was active in Democratic party circles in heavily Republican western Massachusetts Ely attended local schools and then Williams College where he helped organize student support for William Jennings Bryan in the 1900 presidential election He graduated from Williams in 1902 and then received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1905 He returned to Westfield where he joined his fathers law firm In 1906 he married Harriet Zelda Dyson a schoolteacher they had one son

Governor David I Walsh appointed Ely to serve as District Attorney for the Western District of Massachusetts in 1915 he was elected in his own right to this position the next year serving until 1920

Ely was active in the state Democratic Party and was in 1922 put forward as a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts he placed a distant third in the primary which was won by John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald In 1924 he was delegate to the national Democratic convention where he supported the Progressive Al Smith In 1926 he was tapped by the party leadership as a candidate for Lieutenant Governor but lost the primary in an unusual quirk His primary opponent Harry Dooley had been asked to withdraw so that the party could present an ethnically diverse and geographically balanced ticket but his name remained on the ballot and he ended up winning the nomination because of the support of Irish Americans Dooley offered to surrender the nomination in favor of Ely but the latter refused believing the means to be an embarrassment Ely again supported Smith at the 1928 Democratic National Convention

In 1930 Ely again stood for the Democratic nomination for governor He was opposed in this by the aging Honey Fitz who was little more than a proxy candidate for former Boston mayor James Michael Curley Curley loudly accused the Yankee Protestant Ely of being antiIrish which Ely countered by pointing out Curleys own public criticisms of IrishAmerican politicians in his campaigns Al Smith campaigned for Ely who won the nomination by a narrow margin

Ely was opposed in the general election by incumbent Governor Frank G Allen The Republicans were harmed politically by the 1929 Stock Market Crash and the start of the Great Depression and were further divided over the issue of Prohibition Ely ran on a platform emphasizing debtfinanced public works projects

After Ely took office he began a series of public works projects to relieve unemployment These were funded by longterm debts and were approved by the Republicancontrolled legislature Unlike other states Massachusetts refused federal aid during Elys administration Highway construction in Massachusetts was accelerated by this work which was also supported by the imposition of a gasoline tax

Other policies advocated by Ely included substantial reductions in state salaries during the depression which was met with overwhelming legislative resistance In concert with the City of Boston Ely established a permanent Boston Police Academy to increase the training of public safety officers

Curley and Ely would again cross swords in the 1932 presidential election when Curley supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ely supported Smith Ely and Walsh were successful in getting Curley and other Roosevelt supporters excluded from the states delegation to the 1932 Democratic National Convention although Curley attended the convention anyway as a delegate representing Puerto Rico Ely shifted his support to Roosevelt after the latter won the partys nomination but was snubbed by Roosevelt on federal appointment matters because of his support for Smith Ely comfortably won reelection in 1932 defeating Lieutenant Governor William S Youngman Since the debtfunded works projects were not having a significant impact economically Ely abandoned the idea in his second term returning to payasyougo financing for such projects

Ely declined to run for reelection in 1934 and returned to his law practice He remained active in state and national Democratic politics continuing to oppose Roosevelts New Deal policies In 1935 he joined the American Liberty League and supported Republican Alf Landon in the 1936 presidential election He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1944 ending the bid after being badly defeated in the Massachusetts primary

Joseph Ely is well remembered in his hometown where Westfield State Universitys Governor Joseph B Ely Library is named in his honor

Armed Forces Flag Day
The Armed Forces Flag Day or the Flag Day of India is a day dedicated to India towards collection of funds from people of India for the welfare of the Indian Armed Forces personnel It has been observed annually in India on December 7 since 1949 Over the years it has become a tradition to commemorate this day as an honour to the soldiers sailors and airmen of India

Immediately after India achieved independence a need arose for the government to manage the welfare of its defence personnel On August 28 1949 a committee set up under the defence minister decided to observe a Flag Day annually on December 7 The idea behind observing a Flag Day was to distribute small flags to the general population and in return collect donations Flag Day gains more significance as it considers that it is the responsibility of the civilian population of India to take care of the families and dependents of the armed forces personnel who fight for the country

Jawaharlal Nehru who was then Prime Minister of India on December 7 1954 said

The Flag day is mainly observed to serve three basic purposes

The Armed Forces Flag Day commemoration and the collection of funds through distribution of flags It is a time for Indians to express its gratitude and appreciation to the current and veteran military personnel of India and to acknowledge those who died in service to the country

On the Flag Day all three branches of the Indian armed forces the Indian Army the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy arrange a variety of shows carnivals dramas and other entertainment programmes to showcase to the general public the efforts of their personnel to ensure national security Throughout the country small flags and car flags in red deep blue and light blue colours representing the three Services are distributed in return for donations

The original Flag Day Fund was set up in 1949 by the Defence Ministers Committee In 1993 the Defence Ministry of India consolidated related welfare funds into a single Armed Forces Flag Day fund Those funds include

The fund collection is managed throughout the country by the local arms of the Kendriya Sainik Board KSB which is part of the Ministry of Defence The collection is organised both by official and nonofficial means through voluntary organisations Though welfare of the exservicemen and their dependents is the joint responsibility of the union government and the governments of States and Union Territories UTs majority of the problems have to be resolved only by the States and UTs Like the Kendriya Sainik Board at the Centre the Rajya  Zila Sainik Boards are responsible for policy formulation and implementation of resettlement and welfare schemes for exservicemen widows and their dependents residing in their respective States  UTs  Districts To assist the Central Government in this regard there are 32 Rajya Sainik Boards and 392 Zila Sainik Boards in the country

The Secretary KSB advises the Department of Sainik Welfare in the States  UTs on the policies for resettlement and welfare of exservicemen widows and seeks reports from the Director Department Sainik Welfare  Secretary RSB and Zila Sainik Welfare Officer  Secretary ZSB on implementation of policies and success in resettling exservicemen widows disabled personnel invalidated out from the Service and their dependents Advice is also rendered on the welfare schemes required for the clientele which are financed from funds allotted by the Governments of States  UTs and the Amalgamated Special FundsThe Fund is operated by a Managing Committee presided over by the Defence Minister at the Centre and by the executive heads of the governments in the States and Union Territories When the Armed Forces Flag Day programme was introduced the fund allocation was managed in such a way that the Central KSB headquarters is given only a very small share of the Flag Day Fund collections made by each state The allotted funds for the KSB is only half a paisa per individual in the state

Alvan T Fuller
Alvan Tufts Fuller February 27 1878  April 30 1958 was an American businessman politician art collector and philanthropist from Massachusetts He opened one of the first automobile dealerships in Massachusetts which in 1920 was recognized as the worlds most successful auto dealership and made him one of the states wealthiest men Politically a Progressive Republican he was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916 and served as a United States Representative from 1917 to 1921

From 1925 to 1929 Fuller was Governor of Massachusetts continuing the fiscally conservative and socially moderate policies of his predecessors In 1927 he was enveloped in the international controversy surrounding the trial and execution of Sacco and Vanzetti Italian immigrant anarchists convicted of robbery and murder Fullers handling of the affair in which pressure was applied by both domestic and international sources seeking clemency for the two effectively ended his political career

Fuller was an avid collector of art some of which has since been donated to museums in eastern New England including the Museum of Fine Arts Boston He founded the Fuller Foundation a charity that supports a variety of causes in eastern Massachusetts and the seacoast region of New Hampshire Fuller Gardens founded by him in North Hampton New Hampshire are now open to the public

Alvan Tufts Fuller was born in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston on February 27 1878 to working class parents Alvan and Flora Tufts Fuller His family moved to Malden Massachusetts when he was still a child He first worked in a rubber factory repairing bicycles on the side To promote his bicycle business he raced winning local events He also engaged in a practice shared by other bicycle shops in the area of holding an open house on the Washingtons Birthday holiday

Enamored by the new automobile Fuller sold his racing trophies to finance a trip to Europe in 1899 where he learned more about the automobile industry He acquired two cars French De DionBouton voiturettes and had them shipped to Boston they were the first motor vehicles brought in through that port In 1903 he was awarded the Boston franchise for selling Packards and later also acquired the local Cadillac franchise
Fuller was enormously successful in the automobile business extending his sales reach as far west as Worcester and south to Providence Rhode Island He opened his first dealership on Commonwealth Avenue in the Allston neighborhood of Boston then a largely undeveloped area known by sheer coincidence as Packards corner after the owner of a nearby livery yard He was however soon followed by other auto dealers creating the Boston areas first auto row Fuller was a significant factor in the success of Packard sales on the east coast and was in 1920 dubbed the worlds most successful car dealer In 1927 he began construction on a new building at 808 Commonwealth Avenue Designed by the noted industrial architect Albert Kahn it became the flagship showroom for his Cadillac dealership It is now owned by Boston University and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places

As a car dealer Fuller continued the practice of holding Washingtons Birthday open houses but the scale of events he staged was significantly more elaborate and he is generally credited with popularizing the idea of the Presidents Day car sale that is now common in the United States

Fuller became interested in politics around 1912 supporting Theodore Roosevelt in his Bull Moose candidacy for the presidency He refused the Progressive Party nomination for Governor of Massachusetts in 1912 but won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1914 under its banner Joining the Republican Party in 1916 he served as a delegate to its convention in 1916 The same year he ran for the United States House of Representatives as an independent winning a 16vote victory over longtime incumbent Republican Ernest W Roberts He served two terms in the Sixtyfifth and Sixtysixth Congresses from March 4 1917 to January 5 1921 winning election to the second term by a wider margin as a Republican

Fuller was an outspoken proponent of reform within Congress and as a matter of principle never cashed paychecks he received for his public service or used the Congressional franking privilege He criticized the inefficient means by which legislation made its way through Congress calling it the most expensive barnacle that ever attached itself to the ship of state Criticisms such as these prompted President Woodrow Wilson to introduce a new and more centralized budgeting system in 1919 Reforms Fuller proposed included a number of steps designed to increase transparency and reduce opportunities for political influence within the operations of Congress
In 1920 Fuller ran for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts and won two terms serving as the 48th lieutenant governor from 1921 to 1925 alongside Governor Channing Cox His principal opposition in both elections was in the Republican primary where he was pitted against the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Joseph E Warner The Democrats were then relatively disorganized and lacking effective leadership and were unable to counter the basic Republican message of economy and sound administration that had characterized recent elections

Fuller was elected 50th Governor in 1924 after Cox decided not run for reelection The 1924 election was against the colorful Mayor of Boston James Michael Curley Fullers campaign rhetoric focused on the excesses of what it called Curleyism which it likened to a graftridden spending spree Curley attempted to tie Fuller to the Ku Klux Klan but his charges were exposed as meritlessFullers wife was Roman Catholic a group the Klan disliked and Fuller was known to have contributed to Catholic charities Fuller was reelected by a substantial majority in 1926 over William A Gaston in a campaign dominated by Democratic calls for reform of Prohibition As he had while in Congress Fuller refused compensation for his services

Fuller was viewed as a law and order prodeath penalty governor and a fiscal conservative He was like his predecessors a social moderate enacting modest reforms in areas such as automobile insurance
Fullers tenure as governor coincided with the Sacco and Vanzetti case a series of trials for murder and robbery followed by legal appeals that culminated in domestic and international calls for the governor to either grant a new trial or to commute the death sentences of the two Italian immigrants active in anarchist political circles He appointed a threemember panel consisting of Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell MIT President Dr Samuel W Stratton and retired Probate Judge Robert Grant to conduct a complete review of the case and determine if the trials were fair The committee reported that no new trial was called for and based on that assessment Governor Fuller refused to delay their executions or grant clemency On May 10 1927 while Fuller was considering requests for clemency a package bomb addressed to him was intercepted in the Boston post office A few months after the executions he endorsed proposals to reform the states judicial procedures to require a more thorough review of capital cases The episode led to Fuller being characterized in the international press as provincial and the controversy surrounding the cases and criticism of his handling of it which was widely seen to exacerbate rather than diminish political tensions effectively ended his hopes for higher office New York Times reporter Louis Stark repeated a widely held belief that Fullers decision to deny clemency was motivated by a desire to succeed Calvin Coolidge in the presidency but there is no substantive evidence to corroborate this idea beyond the coincident timing of Coolidges announced decision not run in 1928 and Fullers decision In 1930 Fuller stated in an interview that he was more concerned about the political activities of the two men and their supporters which he saw as a threat to order and security of the United States When Fuller was offered a print edition of The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti in 1929 at the inauguration of his successor he deliberately threw it to the ground

In 1928 Fuller was an early supporter of Herbert Hoovers presidential campaign after considering his own run for the presidency and was briefly considered as a candidate for Vice President He was dropped from consideration because as Republican Senator William Borah put it The Republican Party cannot afford to spend the summer debating the SaccoVanzetti case His handling of the case was seen to reduce support for the ticket among immigrant communities He was dropped from consideration by the Hoover administration for consideration as United States Ambassador to France after the French government indicated it could not guarantee his safety due to the SaccoVanzetti affair When the controversy was at its height in 1927 the Fullers had traveled to France and the French government had secretly provided heightened security around their movements Fuller considered running for Senate in 1930 and Governor in 1934 but dropped out of the primaries in those races In 1933 he was appointed by the Public Works Administration PWA to a board overseeing the distribution of PWA funds in Massachusetts He was again considered as a Vice Presidential nominee in 1932 but ran well back in the convention balloting

After leaving office Fuller returned to his automotive business serving as chairman of the board of CadillacOldsmobile Co of Boston In 1949 he dropped the Packard dealership and focused exclusively on the Cadillac and Oldsmobile brands

Fuller was a philanthropist and art collector serving as a trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston MFA Painters represented in his collection included Renoir Rembrandt Turner Gainsborough Sargent Monet Van Dyck Romney Boccaccino Boucher and Reynolds Paintings that he and his successors donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the MFA include Monets The Water Lily Pond Renoirs Boating Couple and van Dycks Princess Mary Daughter of Charles I His philanthropy was wideranging and included art hospitals education religion municipalities and social services He established The Fuller Foundation Inc during his lifetime still in operation it supports many charitable agencies in the Greater Boston area and the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire

Fuller died in Boston on April 30 1958 He was interred in East Cemetery also known as the Little River Cemetery in North Hampton New Hampshire where he had a summer home The summer property included a large garden that the Fullers developed with landscape design guidance by Arthur Shurtleff and the Olmsted Brothers It is now open to the public seasonally

Fuller married Viola Theresa Davenport of Somerville in Paris in 1910 with whom he had four children two boys and two girls She had a brief career as an opera singer performing in Paris and then debuting in Boston in 1910 She died in 1959

Peter Fuller his youngest son was an avid supporter of civil rights and continued the family auto business He was the owner of Dancers Image the horse that won the Kentucky Derby in 1968 Fuller was stripped of his winning title because a banned drug was found in the horses urine He and his supporters claimed he had been singled out because he had recently donated a winners purse of 77415 from a different race to Coretta Scott King the widow of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr who had been assassinated a month earlier and who the year before had disrupted derby events by demonstrating against housing discrimination in nearby Louisville He lost a fouryear legal battle to retain the Kentucky Derby title and prize money

Fullers automobile dealership established with license 1 continues to be operated within the family Now dealing in rentals and used vehicles it has locations in Watertown and Waltham Massachusetts

<doc id="7720600" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7720600" title="AngloSaxon military organization">
AngloSaxon military organization
AngloSaxon military organization is difficult to analyze because there are many conflicting records and opinions as to the precise occurrences and procedures AngloSaxon England was known for its tumultuous nature and the constant presence of outside threats and dangers made it necessary for a solid military to be constantly in place However in spite of this by the 10th century the Saxon kingdom of England was perhaps the best ordered state in Europe with a highly efficient administration that had a solid currency and could raise taxes to support a military establishment Even though there is some controversy as to the accurate forms of military organization some aspects can be deduced from the records that have been preserved

The period can however be split into two before settlement AD 400 to AD 600 and the settlement period when the Saxons had established organized kingdoms AD 600 to AD 1066

The Saxons were organized into warbands led by a chief The warriors comprising the warband were professional soldiers though perhaps without the discipline of the Romans There were three classes of warrior

The Gedriht were the personal followers of the chief and were sworn to die with him There would have been few of them in each warband They would have been well armed and the majority would have worn a helmet and chainmail armour The main weapon was the Gar a 25m long spear with an ash shaft Old English gar  spear Many would have carried long slashing swords

The second group were the Geoguth or young warriors They would have formed the bulk of the warband and would have carried a shield spear and Seax a single edged dagger or short sword Few would have had helmets or defensive armour
The Duguth or old warriors appear later in this period They would have carried the same equipment as the geoguth and served mainly to provide a stabilising element in battle

In addition there would have been skirmishers armed with either a bow or sling

This appears to have changed during this period At the beginning the shield was small more like a buckler and suggests that the men fought in open order Later the shield was enlarged up to 1m across and the warband fought in close order which required a reasonable level of training and discipline This style of fighting had a long history it was known as a shield wall or phalanx formation

The use of the horse in battle is very unclear and probably only the gedriht would have had them However horses at this period were small and would have had to be battle trained On balance the sources indicate that the Saxons fielded a balanced and effective infantry army It seems likely that horses would have been used either for scouting or transport

It is not clear how large armies were the Saxons themselves described anything more than 30 warriors as an army This was about same number as a ships crew The general view is that an army would have been made up of a number of warbands under a senior chief or Althing and would have been between 200 and 600 strong

The organisation underwent considerable changes becoming essentially more feudal The Gedriht became a more organised household guard  which provided a core of military specialists the huscarls Individual Earls would have had their own household troops There is also a new class of lord the Thegn which was roughly the equivalent of the later Norman Baron Thegns held land from the king and were responsible for raising the Fyrd in their area and leading them into battle The richer Thegns would also have had their own household troops

However the major innovation is in the organization of the Fyrd This in the post Alfred period is called up in groups either to man the Burhs each burh had a manpower level calculated according to the length of wall or to serve in the field army By this process a Saxon army could remain in the field all year as there are always enough men at home producing food and goods The army was thus significantly larger than in the early period In addition by the 11th century the increasing wealth of England its increased centralisation and its growing class of freemen meant that helmets weapons and armour could be made in far greater numbers This meant that by the 10th century laws appear to have required a freeman who had the financial means to own a spear a shield an axe or sword and a helmet The laws of the day required Fyrd members to be men of a particular class freemen who could afford decent equipment and training

Weapons and equipment remained broadly the same although the majority of a warband now had a helmet The Dane Axe which required a great deal of training to use effectively became increasingly popular with the huscarls

AngloSaxon battle tactics have also spawned much debate Some historians believe that horses were used though most argue that the battles took place on foot Infantry battles are reported in many texts from the period AngloSaxon military organization is difficult to analyze

The combat strength of the AngloSaxon army is another issue that cannot be agreed upon by scholars Some historians argue that the army was weak and only used infantry as a means of defense and attack while cavalry were only used for scouting whereas others believe that the army was more powerful employing infantry and cavalry The former argument suggests that the infantry was of a high standard but did not have the capacity to press home an advantage due to the lack of cavalry It was also suggested by historians until the 1980s that the AngloSaxons did not carry high quality weapons

Since the 1970s however archaeologists and historians have created a more varied view of AngloSaxon armies The early Saxon armies are now thought to have been very formidable indeed specializing in highintensity close combat The large shield was an offensive weapon as well as defensive In the later period the Saxons adopted the Danish battle axe which had a 13m shaft and could decapitate a horse or break up an opposing shield wall

There was no cavalry in western Europe capable of consistently breaking a wellordered shieldwall aside perhaps from the Byzantine Cataphracts This was due to the relatively small size of horses and the fact that even with the advent of the couched lance in the 12th century well disciplined spearmen still presented a major problem for cavalry This was demonstrated at Hastings when the Normans who probably were the best cavalry of the period tried all day to break the AngloSaxon line

To judge the effectiveness of any military formation one first needs to determine what was its function The early Saxon armies were aggressive small raiding units that could be quickly combined in a larger unit to take land and goods The later armys function was defensive and was the military expression of an organised state It not only depended on raising manpower through the fyrd but on a network of burghs that provided supply bases and mustering points It was this system that allowed Alfred and his successors to conquer England and for Harold to move his army rapidly against the Danes and defeat them at Stamford Bridge then move elements 250 miles south to Hastings

There are some battles in which scholars generally agree on which tactics and methods were used The Battle of Hastings in 1066 the soldiers were organized with the best in the front line and the less adequate fighters in the following lines They formed a tightly packed shield wall with spears projecting from the front rank over the shieldwall Protecting the areas behind and to the side were a small number of archers javelin throwers and slingers The Bayeux Tapestry also shows armoured Saxon warriors using the long handled Danish axe Either they stood in front of the shield wall or the wall opened to let them through Though this formation has been criticised it was highly effective it provided reasonable cover from missile weapons and was capable of fending off most cavalry It also needs to be remembered that all the Saxons needed to do in order to achieve victory was to hold their position until sunset and the Normans would be forced to break off the days fighting The Normans deprived of supplies and reinforcements be penned into a small area and with no way of feeding themselves or their horses would have been forced to retreat

It was in fact rather effective at repelling the Norman Cavalry and it was only the death of Harold and his brothers probably towards the end of the battle that caused the Saxon command system to ultimately fail and the battle to be lost This strategy was also used in the battle of Sherston in 1016 only with a slight difference  instead of simply holding position the army advanced on the enemy while maintaining their solid formation A refinement of this tactic was used in the crusades as the army neared the enemy line gaps would open in the shieldwall through which the cavalry would charge Military tactics did develop gradually throughout the AngloSaxon period Though there is still much debate as to how efficient the soldiers and the fighting was it is clear that as the ages progressed so too did the power and capability of the army

Samuel W McCall
Samuel Walker McCall February 28 1851  November 4 1923 was a Republican lawyer politician and writer from Massachusetts He was for twenty years 18931913 a member of the United States House of Representatives and the 47th Governor of Massachusetts serving three oneyear terms 191619 He was a moderately progressive Republican who sought to counteract the influence of money in politics

Born in Pennsylvania and educated at Dartmouth he settled in Massachusetts where he entered local politics on a progressive reform agenda Elected to Congress he continued his reform activities and opposed annexation of The Philippines He did not join the Progressive Party but was insufficiently conservative for state party leaders who denied him election to the United States Senate on two occasions As governor he directed the states actions during World War I and orchestrated early aid to Halifax Nova Scotia following a devastating munitions ship explosion there in 1917

Samuel Walker McCall was born in East Providence Township Pennsylvania on February 28 1851 to Henry and Mary Ann Elliott McCall the sixth of eleven children At a young age the family moved to an undeveloped frontier area of northern Illinois where McCall spent much of his childhood McCalls father speculated in real estate and owned a stove factory which was closed by financial reverses of the Panic of 1857 His education began at the Mount Carroll Seminary now Shimer College in Mount Carroll from 1864 to 1866 when that school closed to male students

McCalls parents then sent him east to the New Hampton Academy in New Hampton New Hampshire on the recommendation of a neighbor McCall graduated from New Hampton Academy in 1870 and subsequently attended Dartmouth College where he was a member of the Kappa Kappa Kappa fraternity and graduated Phi Beta Kappa near the top of his class While at Dartmouth he published a newspaper selffinanced by himself and the other editors called the Anvil and was tapped by the Dartmouth president to stand in for a sick teacher of Latin and Greek at an academy in Meriden New Hampshire The Anvil was one of the first studentrun newspapers to comment on national and state politics

After graduating McCall moved to Worcester Massachusetts where he studied law and gained admission to the Massachusetts Bar He then opened a law practice in Boston with a Dartmouth classmate which he maintained for most of his life In 1888 he and two partners purchased the Boston Daily Advertiser for which he served as editorinchief for two years In 1881 he married Ella Esther Thompson whom he met while attending New Hampton Academy they settled in Winchester Massachusetts where they raised five children

McCall was elected a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1887 serving three terms in 1888 1889 and 1892 Politically a reformminded Mugwump he had supported Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 he introduced legislation to govern socalled corrupt practices of elected officials intended to reduce the influence of money and favors in politics The legislation failed to pass the legislature until 1892 He also supported legislation abolishing imprisonment for debt He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1888 and served as the states ballot commissioner in 1890 and 1891

In 1892 McCall was elected to the United States House of Representatives a seat he would occupy for twenty years generally winning reelection by large margins As he had in the state legislature he introduced a corrupt practices act into Congress In foreign policy he was antiimperialist arguing for the independence of The Philippines after the SpanishAmerican War and opposed the Dingley Tariff arguing its rates were too high He was one of the few representatives opposed to the Hepburn Act which enabled the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates He had a reputation as a bit of a maverick because he often strayed from the Republican party line but he maintained a generally conservative voting record and introduced little new legislation

In 1912 McCall refused to stand for reelection and was instead considered by the state legislature for election to the United States Senate in early 1913 to succeed the outgoing Senator Winthrop Murray Crane His opponent John W Weeks was more conservative Republican who had the support of most of the Cranedominated state party apparatus The contest was bitterly divisive an echo of the Progressive Party split that damaged the party at the national level and was narrowly won by Weeks even though McCall led in the party caucus balloting for the first three ballots

McCall was chosen by the party in 1914 as its nominee for Governor of Massachusetts as a unifying force between the more progressive and conservative wings of the party Running against the popular Democratic incumbent David I Walsh on a progressive platform McCall was narrowly defeated with the Republican votes split due to the presence of a Progressive Party candidate on the ballot McCall was nominated again in 1915 with the Republicans deliberately courting the Progressive vote by calling for a state constitutional convention In a rematch with Walsh he was this time victorious He served three consecutive terms with future President Calvin Coolidge as his lieutenant governor In each election Coolidge won more votes than McCall did and the Boston Transcript credited at least one of his victories to Coolidges drawing power

The Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 19171918 was the major political event of McCalls tenure The convention proposed a number of reforms most of which were adopted by the voters State commissions and agencies were streamlined and initiative and referendum measures were added to the state constitution Elections for statewide offices were changed from annual to biennial beginning in 1920 Legislative reforms proposed by McCall to the state legislature were only partially adopted proposals reforming state insurance and the public pension program were left in the legislature and his proposal to abolish capital punishment also failed

Anticipating American entry into World War I in early 1917 McCall formed the Massachusetts Public Safety Commission an emergency response and relief organization that was the first of its type in the nation Coordinating a wide array of public and charitable organizations and major businesses the commission played a significant role in providing relief and other services until it was disbanded in 1918 One of its most important actions was coordinating the states response to the Halifax Explosion of December 6 1917 With only fragmentary reports received early after a blast devastated the Nova Scotia city of Halifax McCall called the committee into action and offered unlimited assistance to the stricken city The state organized a major relief train even before the full extent of the disaster was known that was among the first to reach Halifax and the committees representatives assisted in organizing relief activities on the ground Temporary housing built in Halifax was named in McCalls honor and the states relief efforts continue to be recognized today by Nova Scotias annual gift of a Christmas tree to the city of Boston

In 1918 McCall decided not to run for reelection and again stood for the United States Senate In a party nomination rematch with Weeks he abandoned the campaign after it became clear the conservative Crane wing of the party was standing with Weeks The seat ended up being won by exGovernor Walsh in a Democratic upset In the general election McCall refused to campaign on Weeks behalf a move that contributed to the end of his political career In 1920 he was nominated by President Woodrow Wilson for a seat on the United States Tariff Commission the nomination was rejected by the Republicancontrolled Senate

McCall was engaged in literary pursuits for many years writing in newspapers and magazines of the day Following his exit from politics he focused on these activities writing for the Atlantic Monthly magazine and working on political biographies His writings include biographies of his mentor Thomas Brackett Reed Pennsylvania politician Thaddeus Stevens and he was working in a biography of Daniel Webster when he died

McCall died in Winchester on November 4 1923 His interment was in Wildwood Cemetery His grandson Tom McCall was a twoterm Republican Governor of Oregon serving from 1967 to 1975

Hurricane Bonnie 1992
Hurricane Bonnie was a longlived storm in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season It was the third tropical storm including the April subtropical storm and second hurricane of the 1992 season Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17 Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan it was nearly stationary for over a week in the central Atlantic Ocean On September 27 it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores Just before becoming extratropical it affected the Azores on September 30 although no damage was reported

The origins of the system was a cold front that moved off the US East Coast on September 11 The front moved gradually off the coast and into the subtropical Atlantic Ocean before becoming stationary just east of Bermuda on September 15 Over the next two days the cloud cover slowly detached itself from the front and form into a tropical low in its own right On the afternoon of September 17 the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four

The depression organized steadily that evening and into the morning of September18 Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie and it began to move slowly to the northeast Like most storms that develop in higher latitudes Bonnie was embedded in a largerscale cyclonic circulation at first which minimized shear allowing it to develop and provided weak steering currents The low shear allowed Bonnie to rapidly develop and a small but welldefined eye formed late that morning The storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day while meandering in the open ocean The intensification rate slowed down after becoming a hurricane In addition Bonnie began to slowly move more to the northeast on September19 as steering currents slowly developed Bonnie strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson hurricane scale that morning as well peaking at 105mph 165kmh with a 970mbar central pressure The general track and intensity maintained itself throughout the day and into September20 when the eye became less distinct and Bonnie weakened slightly although remaining a Category2 hurricane Early on September21 the eye became better defined once again and Bonnie restrengthened slightly while continuing its slow northeast motion That afternoon the storm gradually strengthened some more and reached its peak intensity of 110mph 175kmh and a central pressure of 965mbar just under Category3 intensity Bonnie maintained its strength through the evening and into the early morning of September 22 when it began to weaken very gradually and level off Bonnie also began to turn more eastward at that point before it became held up by a blocking midlatitude ridge of high pressure which stalled the motion

Bonnie remained virtually stationary until the morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the westsouthwest in response to the ridge It also began to gradually weaken as the lowlevel center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized Convection also diminished and on the afternoon of September24 Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make a turn back around to the south That evening Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression
The weakening trend ended early on September26 and Bonnie regained tropical storm status that afternoon as deep convection reestablished itself Bonnie continued its change in direction turning to the southeast at this point as it slowly redeveloped despite being in a highshear environment It had also briefly showed signs of becoming extratropical on September27 as it made the turn to the northeast as a weak tropical storm and was operationally declared extratropical at that point until the afternoon of September28 During that period Bonnie actually strengthened back into a highend tropical storm Bonnie roughly followed Hurricane Charleys path towards the Azores thereafter The storm became entrenched in an environment with greater wind shear although it only weakened slightly on September29 as it accelerated towards the northeast The storm crossed over the Azores on September30 as a strong tropical storm with 65mph 100kmh winds After that Bonnie quickly lost its tropical characteristics and was declared extratropical late that afternoon just east of the Azores The extratropical low drifted back to the southwest in a clockwise loop actually approaching the Azores once again while dissipating It dissipated on October2

When Bonnie passed over the Azores only four days after Charley it resulted in tropical stormforce winds across much of the island chain Lajes Air Base reported sustained winds of 40mph 64kmh with gusts to 59mph 94kmh In addition one man was killed by a rock fall on the island of So Miguel No damage was reported in the Azores

Roger Lee Easton Sr April 30 1921  May 8 2014 was an American scientistphysicist who was the principal inventor and designer of the Global Positioning System along with Ivan A Getting and Bradford Parkinson He was born in Craftsbury Vermont

In 1955 Easton cowrote the Naval Research Laboratorys Project Vanguard proposal for a US satellite program in competition with two other proposals including a proposal from the US Army prepared by Wernher Von Braun The Eisenhower Administration selected Project Vanguard In 1957 Easton invented the Minitrack tracking system to determine the Vanguard satellites orbit When Sputnik I was launched Easton extended the system to actively follow unknown orbiting satellites

In 1959 he designed the Naval Space Surveillance NAVSPASUR system The Naval Space Surveillance System became the first system to detect and track all types of Earthorbiting objects It goes through the 33rd parallel which is effectively coast to coast of the US

Later in his career at NRL Easton conceived patented and led the development of essential enabling technologies for the United States Global Positioning System GPS During the 1960s and early 1970s he developed a timebased navigational system with passive ranging circular orbits and spaceborne high precision clocks placed in satellites The idea was tested with four experimental satellites TIMATION I and II in 1967 and 1969 and Navigation Technology Satellites NTS 1 and 2 in 1974 and 1977 NTS2 was the first satellite to transmit GPS signals

Easton was born in Craftsbury Vermont to Dr Frank B Easton a physician and Della Donnocker a school teacher He graduated from Middlebury College in 1943 He also attended the University of Michigan for 1 semester before joining the Naval Research Laboratory in 1943 At the Naval Research Laboratory he worked in the Radio Division on radar beacons and blindlanding systems Easton also worked in the laboratorys RocketSonde Branch which was dealing with space related research

Easton retired in 1980 In 1986 Easton ran for Governor and served 3 terms on the Board of the New Hampshire Electric Cooperative

Easton died on May 8 2014 at the age of 93

George W Bush awarded Easton the National Medal of Technology for his extensive pioneering achievements in spacecraft tracking navigation and timing technology that led to the development of the NAVSTARGlobal Positioning System GPS in 2006 The National Medal of Technology is the highest honor awarded for technology
On March 31 2010 Easton was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame and presented the NIHF Medal of Honor for the development of TIMed navigATION TIMATION  US Patent 3789409 that provided both accurate position and precise time to terrestrial based observers an important foundation for contemporary Global Positioning Systems

Brachypelma klaasi
Brachypelma klaasi also known as the Mexican pink tarantula is a tarantula endemic to Mexico and it is the rarest of the genus Brachypelma

The setae of this species have a uniformly rusty appearance The coloration is very similar to that of the six species of Brachypelma that are endemic to the west coast B boehmei is similar having black tarsi orangeyellow metatarsi tibias and patellas black femora and coxae and orangeyellow hairs on the opistosoma It differs only in the carapace which is yelloworange in B boehmei and black in B klaasi Another very similar species is B baumgarteni Adults of B klaasi have a body length of about 675cm with a 16cm legspan

The species is named in honor of Peter Klaas the collector of the species

B klaasi is found at elevations of 3001400 m above sea level on the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental and some areas on the western limits of the Transverse Volcanic Belt in Jalisco and Nayarit states Its known range extends from Tepic Nayarit in the north to Chamela Jalisco in the south with the largest known population at the biological reserve at Chamela

There is a high rate of collection for the pet trade of B klaasi and other members of the genus Brachypelma As such all members of Brachypelma have been placed on Appendix II of CITES B klaasi is considered to be the rarest and most threatened of the Mexican tarantula species Their slow growth combined with habitat degradation and illegal wild capture for the pet trade means that it is estimated that less than 01 of individual tarantulas survive from egg to adulthood in the wild

WININI
WININI is a basic INI file that was used in versions of the Microsoft Windows operating environment up to Windows 311 to store basic settings at boot time By default all font communications drivers wallpaper screen saver and language settings were stored in WININI by Windows 3x Many of these settings were honored in Windows 9x although the files had begun to be phased out in favor of the Windows registry Windows XP still acknowledged some entries in the WININI file to provide backwards compatibility with older 16bit applications However when a fresh install of XP is performed the WININI file created is initially blank and in Windows Vista and Windows 7 the WININI file was removed entirely

Prior to Windows 30 it was not uncommon for applications to store their configuration settings inside WININI With the release of Windows 30 in 1990 Microsoft introduced the concept of private INI files and some new application programming interface calls so that applications could store their settings in their own files
Today Microsoft recommends using other methods for storing settings

Microsoft bundles two specialized editors for core configuration files such as WININI SYSTEMINI CONFIGSYS and AUTOEXECBAT with its operating systems Sysedit is an MDI text editor that opens all of those files simultaneously available in all versions of Windows since Windows 3x MSConfig included with Windows 98 and above except Windows 2000 is a simpler application that allows a user to enable and disable drivers and applications from being loaded at startup by the aforementioned files and the Run RunEx and RunOnce registry keys
WININI and SYSTEMINI are included in modern versions of Windows for 16bit application support 16bit applications may error if these 2 files do not exist in CWindows

Moosup Valley State Park Trail
The Moosup Valley State Park Trail is a rail trail located on the railbed of a former New York New Haven and Hartford Railroad line in the New England towns of Plainfield and Sterling in Windham County Connecticut The line ran from 1898 until 1968 The rail line was abandoned in the late 1960s and was designated by the state as a multiuse trail in 1987 The trail is owned and operated by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection 

It runs for approximately from Main Street in the center of the village of Moosup to the Rhode Island state line in the town of Sterling where the trail continues into Rhode Island as the Coventry Greenway The Moosup Valley Trail together with the Quinebaug River Trail and the Air Line Trail is a critical link in the Hartford to Providence section of the planned East Coast Greenway

The trail is a work in progress It is open to the public for its entire length and all major gaps and obstructions have been removed or filled in but many sections are rough and unimproved 

The following is a sectionbysection description of current trail conditions

Trailhead at Route 14 in Moosup to Barber Hill Road Plainfield This section of trail is completed It has trailhead parking and starts by crossing the Moosup River on a refurbished railroad bridge The trail is paved with a smooth wide asphalt surface for this section Most of this part was completed as part of the project to replace the Barber Hill Road bridge over the Moosup River

Barber Hill Road Plainfield to bridge over Providence Road Sterling This section of trail is mostly undeveloped It was cleared and graded several years ago and has a dirt rocky surface It is suitable for horses and mountain bikes but not for street bikes The bridge over the Moosup River in Sterling was repaired and given a new deck for trail use 

Bridge over Providence Road Sterling to Spring Lake Road Sterling A brand new bridge was recently completed to carry the trail over Providence Road This bridge replaces the original rail bridge which was removed when the rail line was first abandoned As part of the new bridge project a 34 mile section of trail from the new bridge east to Spring Lake Road was completed and paved with a wide smooth asphalt surface This is the first section in Sterling to be officially completed and the new bridge removes the last physical obstacle along the trails route 

Spring Lake Road Sterling to RI State Line This section is open but is undeveloped It has a rough dirt surface and is best traveled on foot or mountain bike 

The trail continues into Rhode Island as the Trestle Trail a multiuse trail that is operated by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management

The whole trail is in Windham County Connecticut

American Montessori Society
The American Montessori Society AMS is a New York Citybased nonprofit membersupported organization which promotes the use of the Montessori teaching approach in private and public schools The American Montessori Society advocates for the Montessori method in public and private schools throughout the United States and publishes its own standards and criteria for its accredited member schools AMS supports research and public policy that advocate for Montessori education

The American Montessori Society AMS is a nonprofit membersupported professional organization based in New York City with an aim to provide the leadership and inspiration to make Montessori a known branch of education

The organization was founded at the Whitby School in Greenwich Connecticut in 1958 The organization originated by a group of Catholic parents who idealized Montessori teaching methods and schools Due to the increase in interest with Montessori education teaching the curriculum to new teaching staff was essential Dr Nancy McCormick Rambusch who had studied Montessori philosophy and practice in London and was the first headmistress of the Whitby School was appointed the American representative of the Association Montessori Internationale by Mario Montessori son of Maria Montessori The Association Montessori Internationale is headquartered in Amsterdam Netherlands Six months later Rambusch was appointed the first president of the American Montessori Society

In 2012 AMS launched an initiative called the National Center for Montessori in the Public Sector which assists with the growth and sustainability of Montessori programs in public charter and magnet schools across the country The director is Keith Whitescarver EdD

In 2007 AMS celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening of the first Montessori school the Casa dei Bambini in Rome Italy in 1907 More than 5000 educators attended Keynote speakers included poet Maya Angelou The honorary chairperson was US Senator Christopher J Dodd DCT

The AMS Annual Conference in San Francisco California drew media interest because of the Demonstration Montessori Classroom that allowed visitors to observe elementary students at work in an actual classroom constructed in the conference hotel

The American Montessori Society Archives are housed at the Thomas J Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut in Storrs The multimedia collection reflects the professional and administrative activities of AMS going back to its earliest days and also provides historical information about the Montessori system of education

Teacher education programs TEPs affiliated with the American Montessori Society provide courses for people who want to be Montessori teachers

In 1967 the US Patent Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled that the term Montessori has a generic andor descriptive significance Therefore in the United States and around the world the term can be used freely without giving any guarantee of how closely if at all a program applies Montessoris work The ruling has led to tremendous variation in schools claiming to use Maria Montessoris methods

Spanish Arch
The Spanish Arch  and the Cao Arch  in Galway city Ireland are two remaining arches on the Ceann an Bhalla Front Wall The two arches were part of the extension of the city wall from Martins Tower to the bank of the River Corrib as a measure to protect the citys quays which were in the area once known as the Fish Market now Spanish Parade It was constructed during the mayoralty of Wylliam Martin in 1584 being called ceann an bhalla the head of the wall

In the 18th century the Eyre family of Eyrecourt County Galway created an extension of the quays called The Long Walk and created the arches to allow access from the town to the new quays The designation Spanish is not historical to this period and was likely known as the Eyre Arch when built 
In 1755 the arches were partially destroyed by the tsunami generated by the 1755 Lisbon earthquake

Virginias 5th congressional district
Virginias fifth congressional district is a United States congressional district in the commonwealth of Virginia It is Virginias largest district with an area of  and is larger in area than six US states

The districts first representative in Congress was James Madison who defeated James Monroe in the districts first congressional election Madison and Monroe would go on to serve as the 4th and 5th Presidents of the United States The current Congressman is Republican Denver Riggleman 
Historically the 5th was one of the first districts of Virginia to turn Republican in Presidential elections  though unlike the 6th where the decisive factor was ticketsplitting by Byrd Organization Democrats here the decisive factor was the growth of middleclass Republicanism in the Charlottesville metropolitan area In the decade preceding the Voting Rights Act these were joined by a significant proportion of Virginias limited and almost entirely white electorate who preferred GOP positions on black civil rights The district was to be one of two in Virginia giving a plurality to segregationist George Wallace in 1968 and has never supported a Democrat for President since Harry S Truman

However the district was continually represented in Congress by fairly conservative Democrats until Virgil H Goode Jr switched parties first to independent and then to Republican In 2008 progressive Democrat Tom Perriello defeated Goode Jr by running on a progressive platform Perriello lost to Republican Robert Hurt in 2010

Virginias 6th congressional district
Virginias sixth congressional district is a United States congressional district in the Commonwealth of Virginia It covers much of the westcentral portion of the state including Roanoke Lynchburg and most of the Shenandoah Valley The current representative is Ben Cline R who has held the seat since the 2019 retirement of incumbent Republican Bob Goodlatte

The district was an open seat in 2018 In November 2017 Goodlatte announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term and would not seek reelection 

Historically the 6th district was one of the first areas of Virginia to turn Republican Many of the old Byrd Democrats in the area began splitting their tickets and voting Republican at the national level as early as the 1930s It was also one of the first areas of Virginia where Republicans were able to break the long Democratic dominance at the state and local level The district itself was in Republican hands from 1953 to 1983 Olin won the seat in 1982 and held it for a decade before Goodlatte won it

Some counties in the district havent supported a Democrat for president since Franklin D Roosevelt For instance Highland and Shenandoah counties last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1932 and Augusta and Roanoke counties have not supported a Democrat since 1944 The district as a whole hasnt supported a Democrat for president since Lyndon B Johnson in 1964

La finta semplice
La finta semplice The Fake Innocent K 51 46a is an opera buffa in three acts for seven voices and orchestra composed in 1768 by then 12yearold Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Young Mozart and his father Leopold were spending the year in Vienna where Leopold was trying to establish his son as an opera composer He was acting on a suggested request from the Emperor Joseph II that the young boy should write an opera

Leopold chose an Italian libretto by the Vienna court poet Marco Coltellini which was based on an early work by Carlo Goldoni During rehearsals the opera was the victim of intrigues from competing composers claiming that the work was not from the 12yearold boy but from his father Threatened with a sabotaged first night by the impresario Giuseppe Affligio Leopold prudently decided to withdraw The opera was never staged in Vienna It was probably performed the following year in Salzburg at the request of the PrinceArchbishop

Mozart produced a full score of three acts 26 numbers in a manuscript of 558 pages It includes an overtureSinfonia one coro one duet three ensembles at the end of each act and 21 arias

The opera was recorded in its entirety by Leopold Hager for Orfeo in January 1983 with Helen Donath and Teresa Berganza a performance lasting two hours 45 minutes Another recording was made in November 1989 with Barbara Hendricks and Ann Murray and conducted by Peter Schreier This version was selected by Philips to be part of The Complete Mozart Edition of all the works of Mozart published in 1991

However since its premiere in 1769 the opera was not staged until modern times It was performed at the 2006 Salzburg Festival as part of the production of all of 22 Mozarts operas The performances were published in the collection of DVDs known as M22 by Deutsche Grammophon

The opera was something of a temporary career setback for Mozart amid a childhood otherwise characterized by universal success and stardom The instigation of the work was a suggestion made by Emperor Joseph II to Mozarts father Leopold during a visit made to the Imperial capital of Vienna by the Mozart family 10 January 1768 to the end of December 1768 Leopold wanted to promote the exceptional talent of young Mozart with the hope of establishing him as an opera composer

The Emperor suggested to Leopold that Wolfgang write an opera for performance in Vienna to show his remarkable skills to the Viennese public as he had already done all over Europe

Leopold needed a good libretto and he had the choice between seria and buffa He noted that the seria singers available in Milan were mediocre while the buffa singers were excellent There are no singers here for serious opera Even Glucks tragic opera Alceste was performed entirely by opera buffa singers He too is now writing an opera buffa  30 January 1768 Leopold thus chose a buffa libretto and for so doing he simply went to the established librettist in Vienna who happened to be the Florentine Marco Coltellini an Italian poet who was to replace Metastasio as poeta cesareo at the Imperial court of the Habsburgs in 1769

Together they selected a libretto by Goldoni the master of the commedia dellarte genre Coltellini modified the libretto somewhat especially act 3 He abandoned some arias replaced a few with his own and in some cases kept the original Goldoni aria in the scene while adding a new one of his own with the result that a few scenes ended up with two arias instead of one as was the norm usually coming at the end of the scene In Coltellinis version four scenes start with an opening aria and end with another act 1 scene 3 nos 4 and 5 arias act 2 scene 6 nos 16 and 17 arias act 3 scene 1 nos 22 and 23 arias act 3 scene 2 nos 24 and 25 arias

Some writers claim that when the opera was finished the performers apparently disliked it The failure of La Finta Semplice in Vienna which went through rehearsals but didnt reach full performance has been the object of similar hazy and cursory descriptions

Hermann Abert 18711927 describes in more precise detail the facts of this fiasco in his monumental book W A Mozart 1919 transl 2007 This was to be the 5th edition of the famous book of the same title by Otto Jahn 185659 the first scholarly biography of Mozart done with rigorous scientific conscientiousness Deutsche Grndlichkeit by a professional archeologist who had become a scholarly expert of ancient Greek vase paintings Cliff Eisen who edited the translation of Aberts book in 2007 for Yale University Press with the best scholarship then available does not dispute Aberts historical facts and reasonings presented in chapter 5 First operas in Vienna p8295 which provided the following quotes

The first act completed Mozart sent it off to the singers who according to Leopold expressed their total satisfaction Then Coltellini started making alterations on the request of Mozart and the singers and took so long that Easter of 1768 the projected date of the first performance went by Mozart refused to be troubled by this but continued to work on the opera eagerly and enthusiastically writing new arias whenever he was asked to do so Abert p86 soon completing a score in three acts with 26 numbers covering 558 manuscript pages Young Mozart thus ended up composing a substantial major opera lasting in Leopold Hagers 1983 recording 2 hours and 45 minutes

The controversy arose above all from the jealousy of other composers who started circulating the story that the opera had not been written by a 12year old but by his father Leopold Christoph Willibald Gluck was in town supervising the production of his new opera Alceste and Leopold wondered whether he was also part of the intrigue against young Mozart Leopold resorted to a test of improvisation to prove young Mozarts authentic composition skills to elite aristocrats He would throw open a random volume from Metastasios works and invite Wolfgang to provide a musical setting with orchestral accompaniment of whichever aria he hit upon Abert p 87 

The impresario Giuseppe Affligio an independent contractor alone in charge of the theater and all opera performances and bearing all the costs and the risks made the final decisions about all details of retaining the singers organizing the rehearsals and staging the final production He became influenced by the systematic gossip and started worrying about a negative outcome He began to have doubts fearing that the appeal of an opera by a 12year old prodigy would fade under the suspicions of fraudulent authorship He found successive reasons to delay the performance

Things dragged on until the artists started worrying in turn about the damage to their own reputations if the opera was a flop The same singers who had declared themselves well satisfied with music that they described as grateful now began to fear for the success of the production when they saw how much effort was being expended on preventing it from going ahead Leopold complained at the singers duplicity as the Viennese aristocrats knew nothing of the inner wickedness of these beasts 14 September 1768 Abert p87

Abert gave an extensive musical analysis of the opera and underlined the high quality of many arias written by Mozart such as 
and the 3 ensembles of the finales of each act where young Mozart displays his remarkable facility in synchronizing the parts of 7 singers
It is not credible that the singers could have shown displeasure at such charming arias Here Leopolds account must be trusted against other commenters of the time

In fact the turmoil put everybodys reputation at stake including that of the Salzburg PrinceArchbishop whose employees the Mozarts were representing him in Vienna Leopold wrote that the artists employed and recommended by the archbishop should not be treated as liars charlatans and impostors who venture forth with his gracious permission to throw dust in peoples eyes like common conjurors 30 July 1768 Abert p88 Affligio got so worked up that he even threatened if the work got to first night to make sure the opening would be a disaster He would ensure that it was a fiasco and that it was booed off the stage Leopold could not take the risk for himself and to thus endanger the unblemished reputation of his son and was left with no alternative but to abandon the production Leopold withdrew from the rehearsals

In fact Affligio was an adventurer and gambler who had obtained his officers commission by fraudHis complete lack of any understanding of art is clearHe was finally sent to the galleys for forgery Abert p88

The whole affair had dragged on for 9 months and in order to salvage his reputation Leopold wrote an indignant petition to the emperor on 21 September 1768 complaining of a conspiracy on the part of the theatre director Giuseppe Affligio who apparently claimed that Wolfgangs music was ghostwritten by his father and proving Mozarts output by including a list of his compositions to that time See also EisenSadie Grove Online also Cliff Eisen Cambridge Mozart Encyclopedia

Leopold was also requesting the payment of the 100 ducats promised on delivery of the score in the initial Affligio contract plus the reimbursement of his expenses The petition failed The letter is reprinted in English translation in Deutsch 1965 pp8083 The Emperor ordered an inquiry but its result was that the opera was not to be produced

The Mozarts left Vienna at the end of December 1768 with La finta semplice still unperformed It was probably produced in their home town of Salzburg in 1769 at the request of Leopolds employer PrinceArchbishop Schrattenbach

This affairs unfortunate outcome may also have further soured and alienated Joseph IIs mother the Empress Maria Theresa The Empress had 16 children including 5 sons Archdukes and she was an important relative of a fair number of monarchs and aristocrats who might have been in a position to give Wolfgang a permanent job

She was an austere personage who was already offended by the lack of dignity in the Mozarts European journeys During the Mozarts Vienna visit she may have developed an even more hostile view of the Mozart family

The failure in 1768 cost young Mozart his chance of establishing his reputation as a firstclass opera composer in Vienna which would have been a jumping board for obtaining a permanent position in another European court

Later Mozart was at first very successful in Milan with his wellreceived performances of Mitridate Carnival of December 1770 to January 1771 and especially Ascanio in Alba a pastoral serenata performed for the wedding of Archduke Ferdinand 15 October 1771 By contrast the main opera for the wedding Ruggiero by Hasse on a Metastasio libretto performed the day after the wedding 16 October generated no enthusiasm Mozarts serenata following the main opera was by contrast a great success 17 October Leopold exulted in his letter 19 October In a word it grieves me but Wolfgangs serenata has so overshadowed Hasses opera that I cannot describe it The universal sentiment was confirmed by the Italian and German press 

Maria Theresa had herself commissioned the libretto and composition of the main opera Ruggiero while Mozarts serenata had been commissioned by the Milan authorities Hasse had been Maria Theresas music teacher 38 years earlier and had remained her favorite musician and personal friend But he now was 71 suffering from gout and could barely travel to Milan The Empress was aware that Hasse was too old and feeble for the event and that he was past his prime while young Mozart was only 15 brimming with energy Still she was embittered by Hasses lack of success and consoled him back in Vienna with rich presents This may have contributed to her growing resentment against the Mozarts

After the success of Mozarts Lucio Silla Carnival of December 1772 to January 1773 Leopold overstayed his visit in Milan by a few months still hoping for a position for young Mozart until he was finally advised that no position would be offered Leopold had to leave emptyhanded

The Empress MariaTheresas behindthescenes objection to Mozart was revealed much later when her 17yearold son Ferdinand Imperial Governor of Milan delighted by Mozarts Mitridate and his wedding serenata Ascanio in Alba had expressed his desire to employ young Mozart in his court His mother answered in a famous letter of 12 December 1771 advising her son against it 
You ask me to take the young Salzburger into your service I do not know why not believing that you have need of a composer or of useless people If however it would give you pleasure I have no wish to hinder you What I say is intended only to prevent your burdening yourself with useless people and giving titles to people of that sort If they are in your service it degrades that service when these people go about the world like beggars Besides he has a large family

Elsewhere in Italy Mozart received a very cool reception from another Ferdinand the King of Naples Melograni conjectures that he had received the Empresss bad recommendation from his wife her daughter Maria Carolina

Historian Derek Beales called MariaTheresa monstrously unfair to Mozart Instead of a courtappointed opera composer with a stable income and an easy family life Mozart remained a freelance opera writer all his life

The 1768 fiasco in Vienna proved as important if not more for Mozarts future as what happened later in Milan in 1773 In both cases he was able to compose brilliant operas and in both cases he was unable to gain the kind of recognition that would have resulted in a nomination by a court to a permanent position as opera composer His life and the worlds legacy of Mozart operas would have been different if the fates had smiled on him and the Habsburgs had been more understanding and supportive

Act 1 

Captain Fracasso and his Hungarian troops are stationed near Cremona He and his sergeant Simone have been lodging for two months in the home of Don Cassandro who lives in his grand house with his weakinthehead brother Polidoro and their beautiful sister Giacinta Inevitably Captain Fracasso falls in love with Giacinta and Simone with the chambermaid Ninetta Fracasso and Giacinta want to marry as do Simone and Ninetta But they cant do it without the consent of the brothers Cassandro and Polidoro The two brothers are comfortable with their status quo  they are confirmed misogynists and unwilling to part with their sister The wily soubrette Ninetta devises a plan to outwit the brothers with the collaboration of Rosina Fracassos sister who happens to be visiting Rosina prima donna poses as a nave innocent who is going to make both brothers fall in love with her until they agree to the marriages Polidoro falls in love with Rosina first and proposes marriage immediately At first Cassandro is indifferent but eventually his defences are completely disarmed through Rosinas feigned navety and innocence So far the plan is working

Act 2 

Polidoro naively believes Rosina is planning to marry him Rosina coaches him for a confrontation with his brother Cassandro Polidoro demands half of his inheritance from Cassandro Giacinta fears a quarrel between the brothers but the others look forward to their fight Rosina and Fracasso congratulate each other for their successful plan to outwit Cassandro They continue to engineer the rest of the plot Simone takes Giacinta into hiding Fracasso tells the brothers that Giacinta has fled absconding with the family money The plan is so successful that Ninetta disappears as well Simone announces that Ninetta has also fled taking along whatever she could get The brothers agree that whoever can bring the two girls back should be allowed to marry them even keeping whatever loot can be found Fracasso and Simone volunteer to go on the search

Act 3 

Simone finds Ninetta and they rejoice that they soon will get married Fracasso finds Giacinta but she is afraid that when she returns her brother will not agree to her marrying Fracasso but Fracasso assures Giacinta that Rosina has bewitched the brothers and has them under her complete control Fracasso and Giacinta rejoice at their pairing off Rosina is confronted with her own choice between both brothers She rejects Polidoro who is heartbroken and agrees to marry Cassandro They both mercilessly mock Polidoro for his stupidity All ends well for the three couples except for the odd man out Polidoro who is left alone

Femtosecond pulse shaping
In optics femtosecond pulse shaping refers to manipulations with temporal profile of an ultrashort laser pulse Pulse shaping can be used to shortenelongate the duration of optical pulse or to generate complex pulses

Generation of sequences of ultrashort optical pulses is key in realizing ultra high speed optical networks Optical Code Division Multiple Access OCDMA systems chemical and biological reaction triggering and monitoring etc Based on the requirement pulse shapers may be designed to stretch compress or produce a train of pulses from a single input pulse The ability to produce trains of pulses with femtosecond or picosecond separation implies transmission of optical information at very high speeds

In ultrafast laser science pulse shapers are often used as a compliment to pulse compressors in order to finetune highorder dispersion compensation and achieve transformlimited fewcycle optical pulses

A pulse shaper may be visualized as a modulator The input pulse is multiplied with a modulating function to get a desired output pulse The modulating function in pulse shapers may be in time domain or a frequency domain obtained by Fourier Transform of time profile of pulse However application of direct pulse shaping technique on a femtosecond time scale faces the same problem as direct femtosecond pulse measurement electronics speed limitations Michelson interferometer can be regarded as direct spacetotime pulse shaper since position of the moving mirror is directly transferred to the interpulse delay of the output pulse pair

An ultrashort pulse with a welldefined electrical field formula1 can be modified with an appropriate filter acting in the frequency domain Mathematically the pulse is Fourier transformed filtered and backtransformed to yield a new pulse
It is possible to design an optical setup with an arbitrary filter function formula3 which can be complexvalued as long as formula4 Figure 1 shows how a bandwidthlimited pulse could be transformed into a chirped pulse with a filter only acting on the phase or into a more complex pulse with the filter acting on both phase and amplitude

One can distinguish FT pulse shapers by their optical design ie collinear shapers and transverse shapers and by their programmability ie static or manually adjustable shapers and programmable shapers

Cultural assimilation of Native Americans
The cultural assimilation of Native Americans was an assimilation effort by the United States to transform Native American culture to EuropeanAmerican culture between the years of 1790 and 1920 George Washington and Henry Knox were first to propose in an American context the cultural transformation of Native Americans They formulated a policy to encourage the civilizing process With increased waves of immigration from Europe there was growing public support for education to encourage a standard set of cultural values and practices to be held in common by the majority of citizens Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities

Americanization policies were based on the idea that when indigenous people learned United States American customs and values they would be able to merge tribal traditions with American culture and peacefully join the majority of the society After the end of the Indian Wars in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the government outlawed the practice of traditional religious ceremonies It established Native American boarding schools which children were required to attend In these schools they were forced to speak English study standard subjects attend church and leave tribal traditions behind

The Dawes Act of 1887 which allotted tribal lands in severalty to individuals was seen as a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal selfgovernment and institutions It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of from Native American control Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law or given directly to Indians as individuals The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was also part of Americanization policy it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations The leading opponent of forced assimilation was John Collier who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945 and tried to reverse many of the established policies

Epidemiological and archeological work has established the effects of increased immigration of children accompanying families to North America from 16341640 They came from areas where smallpox was endemic in the Netherlands England and France and passed on the disease to indigenous people Tribes such as the HuronWendat and others in the Northeast particularly suffered epidemics after 1634

During this period European powers fought to acquire cultural and economic control of North America just as they were doing in Europe At the same time indigenous peoples competed for dominance in the European fur trade and hunting areas The French English and Spanish powers sought to engage Native American tribes as auxiliary forces in their North American armies otherwise composed mostly of colonial militia in the early battles In many cases indigenous warriors formed the great majority of fighting forces which deepened some of their rivalries To secure the help of the tribes the Europeans offered goods and signed treaties The treaties usually promised that the European power would honor the tribes traditional lands and independence In addition the indigenous peoples formed alliances for their own reasons wanting to keep allies in the fur and gun trades positioning European allies against their traditional enemies among other tribes etc Many Native American tribes took part in King Williams War 16891697 Queen Annes War 17021713 War of the Spanish Succession Dummers War c 17211725 and the French and Indian War 17541763 Seven Years War

As the dominant power after the Seven Years War Great Britain instituted the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to try to protect indigenous peoples territory from colonial encroachment of peoples from east of the Appalachian Mountains The document defined a boundary to separate Native American country from that of the European community In part this justified the English taking complete control of lands on the European side but the proclamation did not effectively prevent individual ethnic European colonists from continuing to migrate westward The British did not have sufficient forces to patrol the border and keep out colonists Europeans and European governments continued to use militarydiplomatic and economic force to secure control of more territories from Native Americans For further information see European colonization of the Americas

From the Native American perspective European control of an area generally means a dramatic change in their way of life with free movement across hunting grounds curtailed or objected to for instance by Europeans who had different conceptions of property and the uses of land

The struggle for empire in North America caused the United States in its earliest years to adopt an Indian policy similar to the one devised by Great Britain in colonial times They realized that good relations with bordering tribes were important for political and trading reasons but as had the British they reserved the right to abandon these good relations to absorb the lands of their enemies and allies alike as the agricultural frontier moved west The United States continued the use of Native Americans as allies including during the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 As relations with England and Spain normalized during the early 19th century the need for such friendly relations ended It was no longer necessary to woo the tribes to prevent the other powers from using them against the United States Now instead of a buffer against other civilized foes the tribes often became viewed as an obstacle in the expansion of the United States

George Washington formulated a policy to encourage the civilizing process He had a sixpoint plan for civilization which included


Robert Remini a historian wrote that once the Indians adopted the practice of private property built homes farmed educated their children and embraced Christianity these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans The United States appointed agents like Benjamin Hawkins to live among the Native Americans and to teach them how to live like whites

The Indian Removal Act of 1830 characterized the US government policy of Indian removal which called for relocation of Native American tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river While it did not authorize the forced removal of the indigenous tribes it authorized the President to negotiate land exchange treaties with tribes located in lands of the United States The Intercourse Law of 1834 prohibited United States citizens from entering tribal lands granted by such treaties without permission though it was often ignored

On September 27 1830 the Choctaws signed Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek and the first Native American tribe was to be voluntarily removed The agreement represented one of the largest transfers of land that was signed between the US Government and Native Americans without being instigated by warfare By the treaty the Choctaws signed away their remaining traditional homelands opening them up for American settlement in Mississippi Territory

While the Indian Removal Act made the relocation of the tribes voluntary it was often abused by government officials The bestknown example is the Treaty of New Echota It was negotiated and signed by a small fraction of Cherokee tribal members not the tribal leadership on December 29 1835 While tribal leaders objected to Washington DC and the treaty was revised in 1836 the state of Georgia proceeded to act against the Cherokee tribe The tribe was forced to relocate in 1838 An estimated 4000 Cherokees died in the march now known as the Trail of Tears

In the decades that followed white settlers encroached even into the western lands set aside for Native Americans American settlers eventually made homesteads from coast to coast just as the Native Americans had before them No tribe was untouched by the influence of white traders farmers and soldiers

The Office of Indian Affairs Bureau of Indian Affairs as of 1947 was established on March 11 1824 as an office of the United States Department of War an indication of the state of relations with the Indians It became responsible for negotiating treaties and enforcing conditions at least for Native Americans In 1849 the bureau was transferred to the Department of the Interior as so many of its responsibilities were related to the holding and disposition of large land assets

In 1854 Commissioner George W Manypenny called for a new code of regulations He noted that there was no place in the West where the Indians could be placed with a reasonable hope that they might escape conflict with white settlers He also called for the Intercourse Law of 1834 to be revised as its provisions had been aimed at individual intruders on Indian territory rather than at organized expeditions

In 1858 the succeeding Commissioner Charles Mix noted that the repeated removal of tribes had prevented them from acquiring a taste for European way of life In 1862 Secretary of the Interior Caleb B Smith questioned the wisdom of treating tribes as quasiindependent nations Given the difficulties of the government in what it considered good efforts to support separate status for Native Americans appointees and officials began to consider a policy of Americanization instead

The movement to reform Indian administration and assimilate Indians as citizens originated in the pleas of people who lived in close association with the natives and were shocked by the fraudulent and indifferent management of their affairs They called themselves Friends of the Indian and lobbied officials on their behalf Gradually the call for change was taken up by Eastern reformers Typically the reformers were Protestants from well organized denominations who considered assimilation necessary to the Christianizing of the Indians Catholics were also involved The 19th century was a time of major efforts in evangelizing missionary expeditions to all nonChristian people In 1865 the government began to make contracts with various missionary societies to operate Indian schools for teaching citizenship English and agricultural and mechanical arts

In his State of the Union Address on December 4 1871 Ulysses Grant stated that the policy pursued toward the Indians has resulted favorably  many tribes of Indians have been induced to settle upon reservations to cultivate the soil to perform productive labor of various kinds and to partially accept civilization They are being cared for in such a way it is hoped as to induce those still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermination The emphasis became using civilian workers not soldiers to deal with reservation life especially Protestant and Catholic organizations The Quakers had promoted the peace policy in the expectation that applying Christian principles to Indian affairs would eliminate corruption and speed assimilation Most Indians joined churches but there were unexpected problems such as rivalry between Protestants and Catholics for control of specific reservations in order to maximize the number of souls converted

The Quakers were motivated by high ideals played down the role of conversion and worked well with the Indians They had been highly organized and motivated by the antislavery crusade and after the Civil War expanded their energies to include both exslaves and the western tribes They had Grants ear and became the principal instruments for his peace policy During 18691885 they served as appointed agents on numerous reservations and superintendencies in a mission centered on moral uplift and manual training Their ultimate goal of acculturating the Indians to American culture was not reached because of frontier land hunger and Congressional patronage politics

Many other denominations volunteered to help In 1871 John H Stout sponsored by the Dutch Reformed Church was sent to the Pima reservation in Arizona to implement the policy However Congress the church and private charities spent less money than was needed the local whites strongly disliked the Indians the Pima balked at removal and Stout was frustrated at every turn

In Arizona and New Mexico the Navajo were resettled on reservations and grew rapidly in numbers The Peace Policy began in 1870 when the Presbyterians took over the reservations They were frustrated because they did not understand the Navajo However the Navajo not only gave up raiding but soon became successful at sheep ranching

The peace policy did not fully apply to the Indian tribes that had supported the Confederacy They lost much of their land as the United States began to confiscate the western portions of the Indian Territory and began to resettle the Indians there on smaller reservations

Reaction to the massacre of Lt Col George Custers unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at the failure of the Peace Policy The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grants Peace Policy The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and other supplies

In 1882 Interior Secretary Henry M Teller called attention to the great hindrance of Indian customs to the progress of assimilation The resultant Code of Indian Offenses in 1883 outlined the procedure for suppressing evil practice

A Court of Indian Offenses consisting of three Indians appointed by the Indian Agent was to be established at each Indian agency The Court would serve as judges to punish offenders Outlawed behavior included participation in traditional dances and feasts polygamy reciprocal gift giving and funeral practices and intoxication or sale of liquor Also prohibited were medicine men who use any of the arts of the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their heathenish rites and customs The penalties prescribed for violations ranged from 10 to 90 days imprisonment and loss of governmentprovided rations for up to 30 days

The Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Code which remained in effect until 1933

In implementation on reservations by Indian judges the Court of Indian Offenses became mostly an institution to punish minor crimes The 1890 report of the Secretary of the Interior lists the activities of the Court on several reservations and apparently no Indian was prosecuted for dances or heathenish ceremonies Significantly 1890 was the year of the Ghost Dance ending with the Wounded Knee Massacre

In 1857 Chief Justice Roger B Taney expressed that since Native Americans were free and independent people that they could become US citizens Taney asserted that Native Americans could be naturalized and join the political community of the United States

The political ideas during the time of assimilation policy are known by many Indians as the progressive era but more commonly known as the assimilation era18901928 The progressive era was characterized by a resolve to emphasize the importance of dignity and independence in the modern industrialized world This idea is applied to Native Americans in a quote from Indian Affairs Commissioner John Oberly The Native American must be imbued with the exalting egotism of American civilization so that he will say I instead of We and This is mine instead of This is ours Progressives also had a faith in the knowledge of experts This was a dangerous idea to have when an emerging science was concerned with ranking races based on moral capabilities and intelligence Indeed the idea of an inferior Indian race made it into the courts The progressive era thinkers also wanted to look beyond legal definitions of equality to create a realistic concept of fairness Such a concept was thought to include a reasonable income decent working conditions as well as health and leisure for every American These ideas can be seen in the decisions of the Supreme Court during the assimilation era

Through cases such as Lone Wolf v Hitchcock Talton v Mayes Winters vs United States United States v Winans United States v Nice and United States v Sandoval the court set many precedents and provided building blocks for much of the new legislation concerning Native Americans One of the basic decisions that had to be made in most of these cases was how to classify the Indian nations and what rights they were to have Lone Wolf v Hitchcock provides an excellent example of the implementation of the paternal view of Native Americans as it refers back to the idea of Indians as wards of the nation Some other issues that came into play were the hunting and fishing rights of the natives especially when land beyond theirs affected their own practices whether or not Constitutional rights necessarily applied to Indians and whether tribal governments had the power to establish their own laws As new legislation tried to force the American Indians into becoming just Americans the Supreme Court provided these critical decisions Native American nations were labeled domestic dependent nations by Marshall in Cherokee Nation v Georgia one of the first landmark cases involving Indians Some decisions focused more on the dependency of the tribes while others preserved tribal sovereignty while still others sometimes managed to do both

The United States Supreme Court case United States v Kagama 1886 set the stage for the court to make even more powerful decisions based on plenary power To summarize congressional plenary power the court stated

The decision in United States v Kagama led to the new idea that protection of Native Americans could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation of Native Americans into American society

During the years leading up to passage of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act United States v Nice 1916 was a result of the idea of barring American Indians from the sale of liquor The United States Supreme Court case overruled a decision made eleven years before Matter of Heff  which allowed American Indian US citizens to drink liquor The quick reversal shows how law concerning American Indians often shifted with the changing governmental and popular views of American Indian tribes The US Congress continued to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians While many tribal governments had long prohibited the sale of alcohol on their reservations the ruling implied that American Indian nations could not be entirely independent and needed a guardian for protection

Like United States v Nice the United States Supreme Court case of United States v Sandoval 1913 rose from efforts to bar American Indians from the sale of liquor As American Indians were granted citizenship there was an effort to retain the ability to protect them as a group which was distinct from regular citizens The Sandoval Act reversed the US v Joseph decision of 1876 which claimed that the Pueblo were not considered federal Indians The 1913 ruling claimed that the Pueblo were not beyond the range of congressional power under the Constitution This case resulted in Congress continuing to prohibit the sale of liquor to American Indians The ruling continued to suggest that American Indians needed protection

There were several United States Supreme Court cases during the assimilation era that focused on the sovereignty of American Indian nations These cases were extremely important in setting precedents for later cases and for legislation dealing with the sovereignty of American Indian nations

Ex parte Crow Dog was a US Supreme Court appeal by an Indian who had been found guilty of murder and sentenced to death The defendant was an American Indian who had been found guilty of the murder of another American Indian Crow Dog argued that the district court did not have the jurisdiction to try him for a crime committed between two American Indians that happened on an American Indian reservation The court found that although the reservation was located within the territory covered by the district courts jurisdiction Rev Stat  2146 precluded the inmates indictment in the district court Section 2146 stated that Rev Stat  2145 which made the criminal laws of the United States applicable to Indian country did not apply to crimes committed by one Indian against another or to crimes for which an Indian was already punished by the law of his tribe The Court issued the writs of habeas corpus and certiorari to the Indian

The United States Supreme Court case of Talton v Mayes was a decision respecting the authority of tribal governments This case decided that the individual rights protections specifically the Fifth Amendment which limit federal and later state governments do not apply to tribal government It reaffirmed earlier decisions such as the 1831 Cherokee Nation v Georgia case that gave Indian tribes the status of domestic dependent nations the sovereignty of which is independent of the federal government Talton v Mayes is also a case dealing with Native American dependence as it deliberated over and upheld the concept of congressional plenary authority This part of the decision led to some important pieces of legislation concerning Native Americans the most important of which is the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968

This United States Supreme Court case occurred when an American Indian shot and killed a nonIndian The question arose of whether or not the United States Supreme Court had jurisdiction over this issue In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari This request for judicial review upon writ of error was denied The court held that a conviction for murder punishable with death was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison

This United States Supreme court case came about when the surviving partner of the firm of E Montoya  Sons petitioned against the United States and the Mescalero Apache Indians for the value their livestock which was taken in March 1880 It was believed that the livestock was taken by Victorios Band which was a group of these American Indians It was argued that the group of American Indians who had taken the livestock were distinct from any other American Indian tribal group and therefore the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe should not be held responsible for what had occurred After the hearing the Supreme Court held that the judgment made previously in the Court of Claims would not be changed This is to say that the Mescalero Apache American Indian tribe would not be held accountable for the actions of Victorios Band This outcome demonstrates not only the sovereignty of American Indian tribes from the United States but also their sovereignty from one another One group of American Indians cannot be held accountable for the actions of another group of American Indians even though they are all part of the American Indian nation

In this case the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Yakama tribe reaffirming their prerogative to fish and hunt on offreservation land Further the case established two important principles regarding the interpretation of treaties First treaties would be interpreted in the way Indians would have understood them and as justice and reason demand Second the Reserved Rights Doctrine was established which states that treaties are not rights granted to the Indians but rather a reservation by the Indians of rights already possessed and not granted away by them These reserved rights meaning never having been transferred to the United States or any other sovereign include property rights which include the rights to fish hunt and gather and political rights Political rights reserved to the Indian nations include the power to regulate domestic relations tax administer justice or exercise civil and criminal jurisdiction

The United States Supreme Court Case Winters v United States was a case primarily dealing with water rights of American Indian reservations This case clarified what water sources American Indian tribes had implied rights to put to use This case dealt with the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation and their right to utilize the water source of the Milk River in Montana The reservation had been created without clearly stating the explicit water rights that the Fort Belknap American Indian reservation had This became a problem once nonIndian settlers began moving into the area and using the Milk River as a water source for their settlements As water sources are extremely sparse and limited in Montana this argument of who had the legal rights to use the water was presented After the case was tried the Supreme Court came to the decision that the Fort Belknap reservation had reserved water rights through the 1888 agreement which had created the American Indian Reservation in the first place This case was very important in setting a precedent for cases after the assimilation era It was used as a precedent for the cases Arizona v California Tulee v Washington Washington v McCoy Nevada v United States Cappaert v United States Colorado River Water Conservation Dist v United States United States v New Mexico and Arizona v San Carlos Apache Tribe of Arizona which all focused on the sovereignty of American Indian tribes

As more Native Americans received allotments through the Dawes Act there was a great deal of public and state pressure to tax allottees However in the United States Supreme court case Choate v Trapp  the court ruled for Indian allottees to be exempt from state taxation

This United States Supreme Court case resulted when a defendant appealed the decision on his case The defendant filed a writ of error to obtain review of his conviction after being convicted of unlawfully introducing intoxicating liquor into an American Indian reservation This act was found a violation of the Act of Congress of January 30 1897 ch 109 29 Stat 506 The defendants appeal stated that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the offense for which he was convicted did not occur in American Indian country The defendant had been arrested while traveling on a train that had just crossed over from American Indian country The defendants argument held and the Supreme Court reversed the defendants conviction remanding the cause to the district court with directions to quash the indictment and discharge the defendant

This case was sent to the United States Supreme Court after first appearing in a district court in South Dakota The case dealt with adultery committed on a Sioux Indian reservation The district court had held that adultery committed by an Indian with another Indian on an Indian reservation was not punishable under the act of March 3 1887 c 397 24 Stat 635 now  316 of the Penal Code This decision was made because the offense occurred on a Sioux Indian reservation which is not said to be under jurisdiction of the district court The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the district court saying that the adultery was not punishable as it had occurred between two American Indians on an American Indian reservation

In 1634 Fr Andrew White of the Society of Jesus established a mission in what is now the state of Maryland and the purpose of the mission stated through an interpreter to the chief of an Indian tribe there was to extend civilization and instruction to his ignorant race and show them the way to heaven The missions annual records report that by 1640 a community had been founded which they named St Marys and the Indians were sending their children there to be educated among the English This included the daughter of the Pascatoe Indian chief Tayac which exemplified or an early coed school The same records report that in 1677 a school for humanities was opened by our Society in the centre of Maryland directed by two of the Fathers and the native youth applying themselves assiduously to study made good progress Maryland and the recently established school sent two boys to St Omer who yielded in abilities to few Europeans when competing for the honour of being first in their class So that not gold nor silver nor the other products of the earth alone but men also are gathered from thence to bring those regions which foreigners have unjustly called ferocious to a higher state of virtue and cultivation

In 1727 the Sisters of the Order of Saint Ursula founded Ursuline Academy in New Orleans which is currently the oldest continuouslyoperating school for girls and the oldest Catholic school in the United States From the time of its foundation it offered the first classes for Native American girls and would later offer classes for female AfricanAmerican slaves and free women of color

The Carlisle Indian Industrial School founded by Richard Henry Pratt in 1879 was the first Indian boarding school established Pratt was encouraged by the progress of Native Americans whom he had supervised as prisoners in Florida where they had received basic education When released several were sponsored by American church groups to attend institutions such as Hampton Institute He believed education was the means to bring American Indians into society

Pratt professed assimilation through total immersion Because he had seen men educated at schools like Hampton Institute become educated and assimilated he believed the principles could be extended to Indian children Immersing them in the larger culture would help them adapt In addition to reading writing and arithmetic the Carlisle curriculum was modeled on the many industrial schools it constituted vocational training for boys and domestic science for girls in expectation of their opportunities on the reservations including chores around the school and producing goods for market In the summer students were assigned to local farms and townspeople for boarding and to continue their immersion They also provided labor at low cost at a time when many children earned pay for their families

Carlisle and its curriculum became the model for schools sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Affairs By 1902 there were twentyfive federally funded nonreservation schools across fifteen states and territories with a total enrollment of over 6000 Although federal legislation made education compulsory for Native Americans removing students from reservations required parental authorization Officials coerced parents into releasing a quota of students from any given reservation

Once the new students arrived at the boarding schools their lives altered drastically They were usually given new haircuts uniforms of EuropeanAmerican style clothes and even new English names sometimes based on their own other times assigned at random They could no longer speak their own languages even with each other They were expected to attend Christian churches Their lives were run by the strict orders of their teachers and it often included grueling chores and stiff punishments

Additionally infectious disease was widespread in society and often swept through the schools This was due to lack of information about causes and prevention inadequate sanitation insufficient funding for meals overcrowded conditions and students whose resistance was low

An Indian boarding school was one of many schools that were established in the United States during the late 19th century to educate Native American youths according to American standards In some areas these schools were primarily run by missionaries Especially given the young age of some of the children sent to the schools they have been documented as traumatic experiences for many of the children who attended them They were generally forbidden to speak their native languages taught Christianity instead of their native religions and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Indian identity and adopt American culture Many cases of mental and sexual abuse have been documented as in North Dakota

By 1923 in the Northwest most Indian schools had closed and Indian students were attending public schools States took on increasing responsibility for their education Other studies suggest attendance in some Indian boarding schools grew in areas of the United States throughout the first half of the 20th century doubling from 1900 to the 1960s Enrollment reached its highest point in the 1970s In 1973 60000 American Indian children were estimated to have been enrolled in an Indian boarding school In 1976 the Tobeluk vs Lund case was brought by teenage Native Alaskan plaintiffs against the State of Alaska alleging that the public school situation was still an unequal one

The Meriam Report officially titled The Problem of Indian Administration was prepared for the Department of Interior Assessments found the schools to be underfunded and understaffed too heavily institutionalized and run too rigidly What had started as an idealistic program about education had gotten subverted

It recommended

John Collier the Commissioner of Indian Affairs 19331945 set the priorities of the New Deal policies toward Native Americans with an emphasis on reversing as much of the assimilationist policy as he could Collier was instrumental in ending the loss of reservations lands held by Indians and in enabling many tribal nations to reinstitute selfgovernment and preserve their traditional culture Some Indian tribes rejected the unwarranted outside interference with their own political systems the new approach had brought them

Colliers 1920 1922 visit to Taos Pueblo had a lasting impression on Collier He now saw the Indian world as morally superior to American society which he considered to be physically religiously socially and aesthetically shattered dismembered directionless Collier came under attack for his romantic views about the moral superiority of traditional society as opposed to modernity Philp says after his experience at the Taos Pueblo Collier made a lifelong commitment to preserve tribal community life because it offered a cultural alternative to modernity  His romantic stereotyping of Indians often did not fit the reality of contemporary tribal life

Collier carried through the Indian New Deal with Congress passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 It was one of the most influential and lasting pieces of legislation relating to federal Indian policy Also known as the WheelerHoward Act this legislation reversed fifty years of assimilation policies by emphasizing Indian selfdetermination and a return of communal Indian land which was in direct contrast with the objectives of the Indian General Allotment Act of 1887

Collier was also responsible for getting the JohnsonOMalley Act passed in 1934 which allowed the Secretary of the Interior to sign contracts with state governments to subsidize public schooling medical care and other services for Indians who did not live on reservations The act was effective only in Minnesota

Colliers support of the Navajo Livestock Reduction program resulted in Navajo opposition to the Indian New Deal The Indian Rights Association denounced Collier as a dictator and accused him of a near reign of terror on the Navajo reservation According to historian Brian Dippie Collier became an object of burning hatred among the very people whose problems so preoccupied him

Several events in the late 1960s and mid1970s Kennedy Report National Study of American Indian Education Indian SelfDetermination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 led to renewed emphasis on community schools Many large Indian boarding schools closed in the 1980s and early 1990s In 2007 9500 American Indian children lived in an Indian boarding school dormitory From 1879 when the Carlisle Indian School was founded to the present day more than 100000 American Indians are estimated to have attended an Indian boarding school

A similar system in Canada was known as the Canadian residential school system

While the concerted effort to assimilate Native Americans into American culture was abandoned officially integration of Native American tribes and individuals continues to the present day Often Native Americans are perceived as having been assimilated However some Native Americans feel a particular sense of being from another society or do not belong in a primarily white European majority society despite efforts to socially integrate them

In the mid20th century as efforts were still under way for assimilation some studies treated American Indians simply as another ethnic minority rather than citizens of semisovereign entities which they are entitled to by treaty The following quote from the May 1957 issue of Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science shows this

Since the 1960s however there have been major changes in society Included is a broader appreciation for the pluralistic nature of United States society and its many ethnic groups as well as for the special status of Native American nations More recent legislation to protect Native American religious practices for instance points to major changes in government policy Similarly the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 was another recognition of the special nature of Native American culture and federal responsibility to protect it

As of 2013 Montana is the only state in the US with a constitutional mandate to teach American Indian history culture and heritage to preschool through higher education students via the Indian Education for All Act The Indian Education for All curriculum created by the Montana Office of Public Instruction is distributed online for primary and secondary schools

To evade a shift to English some Native American tribes have initiated language immersion schools for children where a native Indian language is the medium of instruction For example the Cherokee Nation instigated a 10year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years 80 or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested 3 million into opening schools training teachers and developing curricula for language education as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used Formed in 2006 the Kituwah Preservation  Education Program KPEP on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults

There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah Oklahoma that educates students from preschool through eighth grade Because Oklahomas official language is English Cherokee immersion students are hindered when taking statemandated tests because they have little competence in English The Department of Education of Oklahoma said that in 2012 state tests 11 of the schools sixthgraders showed proficiency in math and 25 showed proficiency in reading 31 of the seventhgraders showed proficiency in math and 87 showed proficiency in reading 50 of the eighthgraders showed proficiency in math and 78 showed proficiency in reading The Oklahoma Department of Education listed the charter school as a Targeted Intervention school meaning the school was identified as a lowperforming school but has not so that it was a Priority School Ultimately the school made a C or a 233 grade point average on the states AF report card system The report card shows the school getting an F in mathematics achievement and mathematics growth a C in social studies achievement a D in reading achievement and an A in reading growth and student attendance The C we made is tremendous said school principal Holly Davis there is no English instruction in our schools younger grades and we gave them this test in English She said she had anticipated the low grade because it was the schools first year as a statefunded charter school and many students had difficulty with English Eighth graders who graduate from the Tahlequah immersion school are fluent speakers of the language and they usually go on to attend Sequoyah High School where classes are taught in both English and Cherokee

He was part of a 1972 Browns team that went 104 and advanced to the playoffs losing to the undefeated Miami Dolphins Sherk led the Browns in sacks with 10 sacks and led teams defensive linemen in tackles with 91 after totaling three sacks and 83 tackles in 1970 and 84 tackles with four 12 sacks in 1971 The following year Sherk played in his first Pro Bowl after sacking opposing quarterbacks 5 times and making 100 tackles most by any Brown defensive lineman that season In 1974 Sherk made his second Pro Bowl and led the Browns with 10 sacks to go with his 94 tackles

The genus Banksia Lf Proteaceae
The genus Banksia Lf Proteaceae is a 1981 monograph by Alex George on the taxonomy of the plant genus Banksia Published by the Western Australian Herbarium as Nuytsia 33 it presented Georges taxonomic arrangement of Banksia the first major taxonomic revision of the genus since George Bentham published his arrangement in Flora Australiensis in 1870

One of the most important contributions of The Genus Banksia Lf Proteaceae was the publication of ten new species and nine new varieties of Banksia These were
In addition Bsphaerocarpa var glabrescens was redescribed as Bincana and Bquercifolia var integrifolia was redescribed as Boreophila Bcollina was demoted to Bspinulosa var collina and Bcunninghamii was demoted to Bspinulosa var cunninghamii

George further proposed a new infrageneric classification for Banksia redefining some of the existing sections demoting Benthams Bsect Cyrtostylis and Bsect Orthostylis to B ser Cyrtostylis and Bser Orthostylis now Bser Banksia respectively and publishing six new series
The classification was widely accepted and is essentially the one that is in use today

Finally having examined historical specimens at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and elsewhere George published lectotypes for most preexisting Banksia taxa

Willie Bosket
William James Bosket Jr born December 9 1962 is an American convicted murderer whose numerous crimes committed while he was still a minor led to a change in New York state law so that juveniles as young as 13 could be tried as an adult for murder and would face the same penalties He has been in either prison or reformatories for all but 18 months since 1971 and has spent all but 100 days of his adult life in custody He is currently serving a sentence of 78 years to life at Five Points Correctional Facility

Bosket was born in Harlem His father Willie Sr Butch killed two people in a Milwaukee pawn shop shortly after his son was conceived and was sentenced to life in prison where he earned a degree in computer science and psychology Butch was released from prison and went on to get a job as a computer programmer for an aerospace company but was charged with a crime He shot his girlfriend and committed suicide to avoid being caught

Boskets childhood was not ordinary When his grandfather was released from prison he raped Willie many times When he was 9 years old his grandfather had him perform anal sex to teach him about girls His mother Laura had different livein boyfriends who beat her and as a boy Bosket often jumped in to defend her in one incident hitting a man with a pipe and slashing him with a knife and in another threatening Im going to burn that motherfucker up He also suffered a head injury when he ran out into the street and was hit by a car This was all before he was ten years old

When he was nine years old his mother heeding advice petitioned he be placed in a center stating he was a person in need of supervision He was placed at The Childrens Center in Manhattan but escaped and quickly ended up at Spofford which was a secure detention center and a childs equivalent to an adult doing time in Attica State Prison He would be in and out of detention centers and reformatories except for a short time when he turned 21 and had served out his time for murder 

His mother had told him Dont be bullied Hit back To get respect youve got to be the toughest In the different centers he developed a reputation for violence upon which he prided himself He told juvenile authorities that one day he would be a killer just like his father

On March 19 1978 Bosket then fifteen years old shot and killed Noel Perez on a train operating on the New York City Subways 3 train during an attempted robbery near the Harlem148th Street terminal station Eight days later Bosket and another accomplice shot dead another man Moises Perez unrelated to his first victim in another attempted robbery at the back of another 3 train at the 145th Street station one station south of 148th Street In between Bosket and his accomplice shot a New York City Transit employee working in the Lenox Yard adjacent to the Harlem148th Street station and committed two other armed robberies one of them on the service

Bosket was tried for the murders in New York Citys family court As the trial was underway Bosket surprised his own lawyer by pleading guilty to both murders He was sentenced to a maximum of five years in the Goshen Youth Facility Although prosecutors tried to get a longer sentence five years was the most they could get under the law at the time

The short length of Boskets sentence caused a public outcry Governor Hugh Carey had opposed efforts by his opponent in that years gubernatorial election State Assembly Minority Leader Perry Duryea to have juveniles tried as adults for certain crimes However after reading a report on Boskets sentence Carey called the state legislature into special session to pass the Juvenile Offender Act of 1978 Under this act children as young as thirteen years old could be tried in an adult court for crimes such as murder and receive the same penalties as adults New York was the first state to enact a law of this nature all of the other states have since followed suit Because it was Willie Boskets case that was used to push laws allowing juveniles to be tried as adults it is sometimes referred to as the Willie Bosket Law

A year after he began serving his sentence for the two murders Bosket escaped from the youth facility He was caught after two hours tried as an adult for the escape and sentenced to four years in state prison He was returned to the Division of Youth in 1979 and was released in 1983 After 100 days he was arrested when a man living in his apartment complex claimed Bosket had robbed and assaulted him Then while awaiting trial on that crime Bosket assaulted several court officers He was found guilty of attempted assault for the dispute in the apartment and sentenced to seven years in prison 

At this point his escape from the youth facility came back to haunt him He was 16 years old at the time meaning he was now an adult for criminal purposes In New York escaping from a correctional facility is a felony even if the facility is a youth facility If he had been convicted of assaulting the court officers he would have been a threetime convicted felon and under New Yorks habitual offender law he was facing an automatic sentence of 25 years to life However he was acquitted 

Convinced that he would die in prison Bosket took out his rage on correction officers getting into numerous altercations Arrested for one of those incidents he was convicted of assault and arson and sentenced to 25 years to life In 1989 he was sentenced to an additional 25yearstolife sentence for stabbing corrections officer Earl Porter at the maximumsecurity Shawangunk Correctional Facility After the 1988 assault Bosket was transferred to Woodbourne Correctional Facility where in April 1989 he drew a third 25yearstolife sentence for assaulting a correction officer with a chain All three sentences are consecutive His earliest possible release date is September 16 2062 when he will be 100 years oldall but assuring that he will die in prison

For over a quartercentury after the 1989 assault Bosket NYSDOCS inmate number 84A6391 was housed at Woodbourne in solitary confinement Although Woodbourne was nominally a mediumsecurity prison Bosket was housed in a speciallybuilt plexiglasslined cell stripped of everything but a cot and a sinktoilet combination with four video cameras watching him at all times He was only allowed out of his cell for one hour a day apart from medical visits and haircuts Although he was allowed visitors they could only speak to him through a window in his cell 

Bosket once declared war on a prison system that he claimed made him a monster and was cited for almost 250 disciplinary violations from 1985 to 1994 However he has not had a disciplinary violation since 1994 According to a 2008 report in The New York Times due to his numerous incidents of violence during the 1980s and 1990s he was initially not slated to move into the general population until 2046 when he will be 84 years old Department spokesman Erik Kriss told the Times This guy was violent or threatening violence every day Granted it was awhile ago but there are consequences for being violent in prison We have zero tolerance for that

He has since been transferred to Five Points a maximumsecurity prison Although he is still in solitary confinement he is evaluated periodically and due to his clean disciplinary record in recent years may join the general population sooner than 2046 

In 1995 New York Times reporter Fox Butterfield wrote All Gods Children The Bosket Family and the American Tradition of Violence  an examination of the escalating violence and criminality in succeeding generations of the Bosket family where he described Willie Boskets life as marred in violence and dysfunction from its beginning

Laika dog breed
Laika  is a type of hunting dog of Northern Russia and Russian Siberia and is a generic name for several breeds Laika is also the given name for the mongrel who was the first dog in space

Fdration Cynologique Internationale uses the word Laika in the names of three standard breeds Russian European Laika FCI standard No 304 West Siberian Laika FCI 306 and East Siberian Laika FCI 305 which had been bred from the aboriginal dogs of northern Russia and Siberia

The Yakutian Laika is a multipurpose laika breed from the Sakha Republic used both in bird and seal hunting reindeer herding and sled pulling However nowadays it is solely a sled dog So far it has been officially recognized in Russia Estonia Belarus Ukraine Czech Republic Nordic Countries and Brazil In the US it has been accepted to the Foundation Stock Service by the American Kennel Club

The Northeastern Hauling Laika is a sled dog from East Siberia It is not known as a laika breed in its original country Russia but rather as the Northeastern Sled Dog severovostochnaya jesdovaya sobaka so in its case the term laika is simply in international or western use It is typically 58 to 69 cms at height weighing 34 to 50kg and its coat can occur in any colour It is currently unrecognized even in Russia

The Nenets Herding Laika also known as the Reindeer Herding Laika or Olenegonka is a close relative of the Samoyed  therefore also been called the Samoyed Laika  bred by Nenets people It is used as a reindeer herding dog in northeastern Europe and West Siberia Unlike the Samoyed it has different colour variations such as white red brown sable grey black and piebald It is officially recognized in Russia and Estonia

The KareloFinnish Laika not listed in the FCI nomenclature was a small Russian hunting dog with the first standard published in Leningrad in 1936 by the Russian Kennel Federation It was a close relative of Finnish Spitz as both breeds were bred from similar native dog populations In 2006 the Russian Kennel Federation and the Finnish Kennel Club decided to merge the KareloFinnish Laika and the Finnish Spitz together as only one breed the Finnish Spitz This helped to improve the gene pool of both Russian and Finnish populations

Other Hunting Laika breeds or local variations that have been mentioned in international bibliography include

The Russian word laika  is a noun derived from the verb layat  to bark and literally means barker As the name of a dog variety it is used in Russian cynological literature not only in Russian but sometimes in English as well to refer to all
varieties of hunting dogs traditionally kept by the peoples of the northern Russia and adjacent areas This includes not only the three or four breeds known as Laikas in English but also other standard breeds that FCI classifies together with them as the Nordic Hunting Dogs Group 5 Section 2 of the FCI classification

Thus the Norwegian Elkhound FCI 242 and 268 is known in Russian literature as Norwegian Elk Laika    and Finnish Spitz FCI 49 as Finnish Bird Laika   

In Russia the word laika is sometimes used less strictly to refer not only to hunting dogs but also to the related sled dog breeds of the tundra belt which FCI classifies as Nordic Sledge Dogs The Samoyed may be occasionally referred to as Samoyed Laika    however this name also refers to the nationally recognized in Russian Kennel Federation Nenets Herding Laika breed

As the Spitz are a very ancient dog type many smaller types of Spitz resemble each other Medium to small sized breeds similar in appearance from various places in the world include the Wolfsspitz Keeshond Grospitz Mittelspitz Kleinspitz Zwergspitz Pomeranian Samoyed dog Schipperke Norwegian Elkhound Volpino Italiano Italian Spitz Finnish Spitz Indian Spitz and Japanese Spitz

Dhabihullah Mahrami
Dhabihullah Mahrami 1946  15 December 2005 also Zabihullah Mahrami was an Iranian Bah who was charged with apostasy from Islam and jailed in Iran After 10 years in prison he was found dead in his cell
Mr Mahrami was a former Iranian civil servant who lost his job after the government found that he was a Bah Adherents of the Bah Faith are persecuted in the Islamic Republic and are denied employment On August 16 1995 Mr Mahrami was called before the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Yazd and was questioned about his adherence to the Bah Faith During the next few months the court met with Mr Mahrami multiple times and tried to persuade him to renounce his beliefs Upon his repeated refusal Mr Mahrami was charged with apostasy and on January 2 1996 was sentenced to death His properties and assets were also confiscated 

Although Mr Mahrami was a lifelong Bah the apostasy charge apparently came about because a sympathetic Muslim colleague in an effort to prevent Mr Mahrami from losing his job stated that Mr Mahrami had converted to Islam 
Mr Mahramis lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court of Iran on January 28 1997 the Supreme Court of Iran confirmed the death sentence and the news was conveyed orally to his relatives In March 2000 following an international outcry Mr Mahramis sentence was commuted to life in prison Since that time until his death Mr Mahrami had been in a government prison in Yazd and was forced to perform arduous physical labour and had received death threats After 10 years in prison he was found dead in his cell The government informed his family that he had died of a heart attack but Mr Mahrami was reported to have been in good health shortly before his death

After his death organizations including Amnesty International and the United States government called on Iran to order a thorough investigation into his death and allow freedom of religion for all Iranians

Derwent Valley Railway Tasmania
The Derwent Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Tasmania Australia It operates from New Norfolk It is 3 6 narrow gauge

Tasmanian Government Railways opened the Derwent Valley Line in 1886 Initially it ran from the junction at Bridgewater on the main northsouth Hobart to Devonport line to New Norfolk a distance of 18 kilometres It was extended to 29km at Plenty in 1887 and then to 41km at Glenora in 1888 It closely follows the course of the River Derwent for the first 39km as far as Coniston and crosses the river at three different points

The following years saw a number of plans to extend the line further up the Derwent Valley or to connect it to the West Coast Finally twenty one years later in 1909 it was extended along the Tyenna River another 8km to what is now Westerway In 1917 another extension was added to extend the railway to Fitzgerald 66km and a final extension was opened in 1936 to Kallista 74km from Bridgewater The last extension replaced an earlier wooden tramway on the same alignment The primary usage of the line was to provide a service to the rural areas and the logging areas around Kallista In 1940 there was a significant increase in log traffic along most of the line with the opening of a paper mill at Boyer 14km from Bridgewater This increased traffic resulted in the construction of two deviations and additional facilities at a number of stations

Sometime later parts of the railway began to close Firstly the logging branches around Kallista and then the section from Kallista to Florentine Junction were closed In 1995 TasRail completely closed the line beyond New Norfolk after floods and heavy rain substantially damaged the track

In 1990 Derwent Valley Railway Preservation Society was formed It
purchased the assets of the Tasmanian Locomotive Company who had been operating excursion trains on the line The Society established its operating base at New Norfolk although initially operating out of the Hobart suburb of Claremont It continued operating passenger trains on the line to Maydena The Derwent Valley Line was closed beyond New Norfolk in 1995 and so the Society operated to other destinations Although the line remained under Tasrail ownership in 1999 the line was reopened by the society to Hayes then in 2000 to Westerway and then to National Park in 2003 37km from New Norfolk The society now trades as Derwent Valley Railway Inc The Society now has 11 locomotives 4 steam 4 dieselelectric 1 dieselhydraulic and 2 dieselmechanical 9 carriages and 11 wagons

Two of Tasrails freight services regularly used the section from Bridgewater to the Norske Skog paper mill at Boyer carrying paper to Burnie for export and the other supplying the plant with coal and timber from the north of the State

In October 2005 Pacific National who had taken over commercial running of the TasRail network closed the Derwent Valley Line west of New Norfolk This effectively stopped the running of the heritage railway In May 2006 Pacific National came to a new agreement with the Tasmanian Government which included returning all tracks and rail lands to Government ownership

Derwent Valley Railway Inc are currently in negotiations to regain access to the Derwent Valley Line to restore it to its former glory and operate it as a world class tourist railway

Immigration to South Korea
Although immigration to South Korea is low due to strict immigration policies it is on the rise As of 2016 foreign residents accounted for 34 of the total population

Most immigrants are not eligible for citizenship or even permanent residency unless they are married to a South Korean citizen or have invested more than US500000 in the local economy An exception is made for those whose nonfinancial contribution to the nation has been specifically recognized by the Minister of Justice and for holders of a business visa who have invested more than US500000

Nationalities of legal foreign residents who are mostly temporary workers in South Korea as of December 2017
Immigration policy is overseen by the Ministry of Justice through the Korea Immigration Service Related ministries include Ministry of Labor Ministry of Health and Welfare and Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade

The Nationality Act Immigration Control Act Multicultural Families Support the Act and Framework Act on Treatment of Foreigners are the foundation of immigration policy in Korea

The government of Korea initiated a discussion whether to establish independent Immigration Office to accommodate fastgrowing immigration and to prepare inclusive and rational immigration policies from 2003 without progress The Foreigner Policy Committee headed by the Prime Minister is responsible for coordinating policies concerning foreigners which had formerly been handled by multiple ministries However its role is limited due to a shortage of resources and manpower Establishing an Immigration Office is expected to solve these problems by concentrating all the related resources and manpower under one umbrella

According to the UN Recommendations on Statistics of International Migration revised in 1998 longterm international immigration is recorded after an individual enters a country and establishes his usual place of residence there for more than a year So When Korea government build new policies immigrant laborers and children of illegal migrants should be counted to follow this guideline

The Republic of Korea is a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees The Korean government is the competent authority to determine refugee status in Korea

Korea used to be a migrantsource country sending farmers miners nurses and workers to the United States Germany and the Middle East The Korean diaspora numbers 682 million as of 2009 including 234 million in China and 21 million in the United States a slight decline of 220000 since 2007
Korea experienced governmentinitiated rapid economic growth from the 1970s on which has been called the Miracle on the Han River Until the end of the 1980s Korea was able to sustain its development without foreign laborers because it had enough cheap labor In the 1990s however Koreas plummeting birth rate and growing cost of labor caused labor shortages especially in the socalled 3D jobs for dirty dangerous and difficult
Economic development and urbanization led many people to leave rural areas and move to the city in search of jobs and better living conditions However according to Confucian norms the eldest son must remain in the countryside with his parents A chronic shortage of marriageable women arose in rural areas and international marriages began to fill this unmet demand Most international marriage cases are handled by dating service companies that earn a commission

Many migrant workers live in Korea particularly in the industrial suburbs of Gyeonggi Province such as Siheung and Ansan where foreigners account for 76 of the population The largest number of migrants come from China out of a total of 55154 D3 visa holders in 2005 17787 were from China Other migrants come from South and Southeast Asia

In the 21st century binational marriages in South Korea have grown rapidly and foreign spouses have become highly diverse today The number of countries represented by foreign husbands and wives has increased from 88 countries in 2001 to 143 countries in 2015

In the 1990s many brides from neighboring Asian nations such as China and Vietnam have originally immigrated to farming communities in South Koreas countryside Since the 2000s the trend spread nationwide and diversified to include all women in East and Southeast Asia and Nepal For example in 2001 there were 5700 Japanese wives married to Korean men living in South Korea  Their immigration to Korea more than doubled to 11631 in 2015

Foreign husbands have also increased significantly In 2001 there were only 967 foreign husbands living in South Korea In 2015 2433 American 1218 Japanese and 1109 Canadian husbands had settled in the country along with many from a diverse number of European nations Korean women have also married significantly more South Asian men from countries such as Pakistan Bangladesh Sri Lanka or India than Korean men marrying women from these countries This was also true for African men such as those from Nigeria who have visited Korea more often than others Many husbands from these countries have settled in the country after coming to Korea originally for work experience or study

Korean men married significantly more women from PostSoviet states such as Russia Uzbekistan Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan Ukraine and Belarus than vice versa since many brides from these nations are ethnically Korean

However other Asians immigrating to the country to marry Koreans have been consistently declining since 2007 while Western husbands and wives settling in the country with Koreans instead have been consistently rising in the same period

Foreign husbands and wives married to Koreans living in South Korea as of 2017
In 2007 the UN declared Korea an official receiving country The number of foreigners in South Korea grew from 390000 in 1997 to 1 million in 2007 Among these are 630000 temporary laborers as well as 100000 foreigners married to South Korean nationals Furthermore there are 230000 illegal immigrants

Main sending countries are Asian countries such as China Vietnam Mongolia the Philippines Pakistan and Bangladesh However migrants also come from Nigeria Ghana Russia and the United States

From June 14 1998 those who have at least one Korean parent are automatically granted Korean nationality from birth regardless of their decisions on whether to choose the nationality of the foreign parent or the country of birth if born outside Korea

Requirements for General Naturalization include
The South Korean Government says it wants to create a multicultural society and foreignerfriendly environment

As described in the new national plan for immigration policy the government claims a worldclass Korea welcoming of foreigners However critics argue that the governments goals and policies are fundamentally discriminatory In response the South Korean government introduced new regulations in April 2014 which meant foreign spouses would have to pass a Koreanlanguage proficiency test and earn a minimum wage of 14000

Since 1991 Korea has experienced a large influx of foreign workers Approximately 10000 Asian workers came to Korea under a newly established trainee program in 1992 In June 1996 there were 57000 trainees in Korea Despite its growth the trainee program also had problemsnamely that the trainees became undocumented workers due to wage differentials and that they were not protected by the Labor Standard Law as they were not considered laborers

Since 2004 the Korean government has followed the Employment Permit Program for foreigners the product of a decade of interaction between Korean citizens and foreign migrant workers Legally foreigners are allowed to enter mainly to fulfill lowwage jobs and they are excluded from receiving social services Public opinion data shows that Korean citizens retain a discriminatory attitude towards foreign workers

There are many reports from legal and illegal immigrants which have jailed in many prisons in South Korea because of small problems or misunderstanding their visas for long time Also there are some reports about beating and abusing the prisoners South Korea immigration also forced them to buy the deportation ticket

Foreign brides and their multicultural children are growing into a major political issue Sending countries are likely to worry about their immigrants due to deeprooted discrimination against foreigners in Korea Now most immigration into Korea comes from Southeast Asia and immigrant treatment particularly if there is abuse of foreign brides is likely to provoke not only domestic problems but also diplomatic tension What immigration there has been is frequently so focused on the birthrate problem that it is more properly called brideimporting than immigration
The terms kosian or onnurian refer to a person of mixed heritage most commonly applied to children of a South Korean father and a Southeast Asian mother The term Kosian was coined in 1997 by intercultural families to refer to themselves but its use spread in the early 2000s as international marriages became increasingly common in rural areas It is considered offensive by some who prefer to identify simply as Korean

<doc id="7721493" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721493" title="Japanese possessives">
Japanese possessives
The Japanese language has different ways of expressing the possessive relation There are several verbal possessive forms based on verbs with the sense of to possess or to have or to own An alternative is the use of the particle no  between two nouns or noun phrases

Shoyuu  is a Japanese noun of SinoJapanese origin It translates as the state of possession or ownership In Japanese nouns mainly those of Chinese origin may attached themselves to the verb suru  to do to form a compound verb The verb to come to possessown shoyuusuru is formed in this manner
Shoyuusuru is considered a formal term used in reference to possessions with legal certification such as cars in comparison to the native Japanese counterpart motsu  generally meaning to come to haveownpossess
Both motsu and shoyuusuru require animate possessors and controllable alienable possessees The possessee may be humananimate but must be controllable for example a possessee cannot be a fathermother and such The possessor noun phrase is the subject as indicated by the particle ga  and the possessee noun phrase is the object which is indicated by the particle o 


Japanese verbs do not recognise the difference between present and future form There is no verbal conjugation which translates as I will do this The plain form of the verbs shoyuusuru and motsu cannot be used to express present states In order to do this as seen in 1 and 2 the verb must be changed into its te form and have the verb to be animate  iru  attached This form indicates a continuous state of being  I have and I continue to have

3shoyuusuru
shoyuushite
shyoyuushite iru
to havepossessown

4motsu
motte
motte iru
to havepossessown

The sentence structure to be used when using shyoyuusuru and motsu to describe possession is

5 NP1 ga NP2 o Verbte iru
Possessor Subjectmarker Possessee Objectmarker Verbte iru

Iru  and aru  are the presentfuture plain form of the verb translated as to beexist Iru is always used in reference to an animate subject or object and aru always refers to an object or subject that is inanimate

6 jonsanhon wa Osaka ni iruaru
Johnbook SUB Osaka NI bePRES
JohnThe book is in Osaka

When the verb is used following an object marked with ga and a subject marked with ni  the translation becomes to have For example

7 jonsan ni kuruma ga aru
John NI car OBJ havePRES
John has a car

To arrive at this translation the particle ni is read in this context as inat the place where something is at the present So at first the translation for 7 may be considered a car is at Johnin Johns presence In order to reach the translation to have Tsujioka presents these two examples

8heya ni otoko ga aru
Room NI man OBJ bePRES
There is a man in the room

9 jonsan ni musuko ga aru
John NI son OBJ bePRES
John has a son

Sentence 8 is grammatically incorrect as aru is used in reference to an animate object The use of musuko with aru however is allowed as some kinship terms may use the animacyinsensitive form of aru It can then be said that there are two translations of aruiru  to be and to have

Unlike shoyuusuru and motsu however iruaru can express relationship as well as ownership as seen in 9 where John does not physically own his son Rather it is a statement expressing the relationship

Although iruaru sentences may have a possessee that is alienable and inalienable it is not possible to have a modified inalienable possessee

10 jonsan ni pinku no kami ga aru
John NI pink GEN hair OBJ bePRES
John has pink hair

This appears to be the only restraint other than the animateinanimate restrictions and its solution will be discussed in the next section

11 NP1 ni NP2 ga Verb
Possessor NI Possessee OBJ Verb

As mentioned the iruaru form of possessive sentences does not allow for modified possessees There is however another verbal possessive which does allow for modified possessees in fact the possessee must be modified and may only be inalienable This is suru  The sentence structure for possessive suru sentences is the same as that of shyoyuusurumotsu sentences

12 NP1 ga NP2 o shite iru
Possessor SUB Possessee OBJ doPART bePRES

Suru translates as do using the form seen in 12 shite iru translates as doing This is constructed in the same manner as shyoyuushite iru and motte iru

13suru
shite
shite iru
is doing

As with the Shoyuumotsu sentences suru possessive sentences only express ownership and not relationships as the possessee must be inalienable as aforementioned

14 jonsan ga pinku no kami o shite iru
John SUBJ pink hair GEN OBJ doPART bePRES
John has pink hair

The verb zokusuru is translated as to belong to or to be affiliated with The verb does not indicate belonging in the sense of ownership but rather affiliation For example the following is incorrect

15 kono hon wa jonsan ni zokushite iru
This book SUB John NI belongPART bePRES
This book belongs to John

This sentence is grammatically incorrect Zokusuru can only be used when describing affiliation such as in 16

16 jonsan wa ANU ni zokushite iru
John SUB ANU NI belongPART bePRES
John belongs tois affiliated with the ANU

This verb is included in this list in order to describe the difference in translation meanings

The particle no  is used to express possession either figuratively or literally of one noun phrase by a second noun phrase by indicating that the noun preceding no is the possessor and the noun following is the possessee Both the possessor and the possessee can be alienable or inalienable

20watashi no te 

me NO hand
My hand

21 jon no kuruma

John NO car
Johns car

In this way no may modify an unlimited number of nouns for example

22 watashi no inu no beddo

me NO dog NO bed
My dogs bed

In the same way this nounnonoun structure also indicates relationships between the possessor and uncontrollable possessees For example

23watashi no okasan

me NO mother
My mother

24 jon no ani

John NO big brother
Johns big brother

The possessee can be pronominalised by replacing it with either mono  which translates as one as in Johns one or  0 particle Japanese often omits proper nouns and subjects once they have already been mentioned in a conversation and which are then understood through context In the following sentences desu  the copula translates as is

25kore wa jon no mono desu

this SUB John NO one COP
This is Johns one

26 kore wa jon no  desu

this SUB John NO  COP
This is Johns

There is a slight difference in meaning between the two pronouns As Hirakouji states monopronominalisation refers to the possessee as an objectively viewed object while pronominalisation conveys the speakers subjective attention to the object and inclusive contrast and cannot appear in the ordinary focus position Hirakouji presents the following examples in 28 the first no is used to nominalise the preceding clause to demonstrate how pronominalisation cannot be used in the ordinary focus position 27 is incorrect

27kore wa merii no  desu ga are wa jon  desu

this SUB Mary NO  COP but that SUB John  COP
This is Marys but that is Johns

28watashi ga hoshii no wa merii no  desu
me SUB want NOM OBJ Mary NO  COP
What I want is Marys

The phrase structure when using no as a possessive particle is indicated in 29 The phrase constitutes a noun phrase

29NOUN possessor no NOUN possessee

Menemen massacre
The Menemen Massacre occurred on June 1617 1919 in the town of Menemen shortly after the Greek forces landed in nearby Smyrna as part of the post World War I Greek occupation of Turkey

The Ottoman prefect of Menemen Kemal Bey and the six gendarmes accompanying him were assassinated by Greek soldiers in the evening of the first day These deaths became the opening act for further killings carried out on the civilian population of Menemen the following day by a Cretan brigade aided by a number of accomplices from the local Greek minority The event was termed as a massacre by an interallied commission composed of four generals representing the Allied Powers The commission also said that the massacre was not organized by the Greek Command but was as a result of the panic and anger of the young troops who were still affected by the Pergamos Bergama events and whom their officers were not able to calm At Pergamos the Turkish irregulars who retook the city murdered the Turkish inhabitants who welcomed the Greeks and also massacred and tortured all the Greek soldiers who were prisoners

The number of casualties among the civilian Turkish population of the town during the single day of June 17 vary between two hundred according to the October 1919 report drawn up by the InterAllied Commission to one thousand according to a delegation that arrived the next day June 18 1919 Captain Charns the head of that delegation contrasted the number of Turkish victims against the nonexistence of any Greek wounded either civilian or military The October report prepared by the British officers and medical delegates from the British and Italian consulates in Smyrna rejected the 1000 casualties figure as an exaggeration finding that at least 100 had died and mentioning a French officers investigation the day after the massacre reporting that 200 Turks had been killed and 200 injured 

The events were protested by the Ottoman Sheikhulislam The Greek military claimed that they were attacked in the town but the commission did not give credit to their statementsThey found the Greeks alone responsible for the bloodshed 

Demographer Justin McCarthy rejecting the findings of the InterAllied Commission claimed the massacre was preplanned indicated by the fact that before the attacks all Greek houses in the city had been marked with white crosses and were not affected by the pillage and destruction

British Admiral Calthorpe commenting to London on the fact that some Turks of Menemen had managed to survive stated

Celal Bayar the third Turkish president wrote the testimony of the local merchant erkes Sefer Efendi

<doc id="7721553" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7721553" title="History of slavery in New Jersey">
History of slavery in New Jersey
Slavery in New Jersey began in the early 17th century when Dutch colonists imported African slaves for labor to develop their colony of New Netherland After England took control the colony in 1664 its colonists continued the importation of slaves from Africa They also imported seasoned slaves from their colonies in the West Indies and enslaved Native Americans from the Carolinas

Most Dutch and English immigrants entered the colony as indentured servants who worked for a fixed number of years to repay their passage As conditions in England improved and the number of indentured laborers declined New Jerseys colonists imported more Africans for needed labor To promote increasing the number of laborers and settlers in order to develop the colony the colonial government awarded settlers headrights of of land for each person transported to the colony In 1704 after East Jersey and West Jersey unified the Province of New Jersey passed a slave code prohibiting slaves and free blacks from owning property further restricting African Americans in the state

During the American Revolution enslaved African Americans fought on each side The British Crown promised freedom to slaves who would leave their rebel masters and fight for the British The number of blacks in Manhattan increased to 10000 as thousands of slaves escaped to the British for the promise of freedom The British refused to return former slaves to the Americans and they evacuated many Black Loyalists together with their troops and other Loyalists they resettled more than 3000 freedmen in their colony of Nova Scotia Others were transported to England and the West Indies

Bergen County developed as the largest slaveholding county in the state in part because many slaves were used as laborers in its ports and cities After the Revolutionary War many northern states rapidly passed laws to abolish slavery but New Jersey did not abolish it until 1804 and then in a process of gradual emancipation similar to that of New York But in New Jersey some slaves were held as late as 1865 In New York they were all freed by 1827 The law made African Americans free at birth but it required children born to slave mothers to serve lengthy apprenticeships as a type of indentured servant until early adulthood for the masters of their slave mothers New Jersey was the last of the Northern states to abolish slavery completely The last 16 slaves in New Jersey were freed in 1865 by the Thirteenth Amendment

The Underground Railroad had several routes crossing the state four of which ended in Jersey City where fugitive slaves could cross the Hudson River New Brunswick Hub City was a main location where runaways would travel during the days of the Underground Railroad During the American Civil War African Americans served in several allblack Union Army regiments from New Jersey

In 2008 the legislature of New Jersey passed a resolution of official apology for slavery becoming the third state to do so Rutgers the State University moved to rectify its past wrongs and connections to slavery during its 250th anniversary celebration in 2016 Princeton University the oldest college in the state of New Jersey released the findings of its Princeton  Slavery Project in 2017

The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves to New Amsterdam capital of the nascent province of New Netherland They worked as farmers fur traders and builders It later expanded across the North River Hudson River to Pavonia and Communipaw eventually becoming Bergen where slaves worked the company plantation Settlers to the area later held slaves privately often using them as domestic servants and laborers Although enslaved the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact They were admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers who also baptized their children While enslaved Africans could be admitted to the Church the church itself did not prohibit their enslavement In fact the Church did not even find that enslavement sinful Slaves could testify in court sign legal documents and bring civil actions against whites Some were permitted to work after hours when they earned wages equal to those paid to white workers When the colony fell the company freed all its slaves establishing early on a nucleus of free negros

English traders continued to import African slaves after they took over the colony from the Dutch in 1664 and established a proprietorship Eager to attract more settlers and laborers to develop the colony the proprietorship encouraged the importation of slaves for labor by offering settlers headrights an award of allocations of land based on the number of workers slaves or indentured servants imported to the colony The first African slaves to appear in English records were owned by Colonel Lewis Morris in Shrewsbury In an early attempt to encourage European settlement the New Jersey legislature enacted a prohibitive tariff against imported slaves to encourage European indentured servitude When this act expired in 1721 however the British Government and New Jerseys royal governor countered attempts to renew it The slave trade was a royal monopoly and had become a lucrative enterprise

The liberties of the enslaved peoples of New Jersey were formally curtailed under a law passed in 1704 a socalled slave code This code prohibited the owning of property for not only slaves but also free African Americans as well In addition it made certain actions illegal for African Americans like staying out past curfew that were not illegal for European Americans

Camden was a center for the importation of slaves its ferry docks on the Delaware River across from Philadelphia acting as auction sites for the plantations in the Delaware Valley of which Pomona Hall was one

In 2016 Rutgers University published a report Scarlet and Black recording the universitys relationship with slavery In 2017 Princeton University made public the findings of the Princeton  Slavery Project which is ongoing

AfricanAmerican slaves fought on both sides in the War for Independence The British Crown promised slaves freedom for leaving their rebel masters to join their cause The number of blacks in New York rose to 10000 as slaves escaped there from both northern and southern masters after the British occupied the city The British kept their promise and evacuated thousands of freedmen from New York resettling 3500 Black Loyalists in its colony of Nova Scotia and others in the Caribbean islands Colonel Tye also known as Titus Cornelius c 17531780 was a slave of African descent who achieved notability during the war by his leadership and fighting skills and was one of the most effective guerrilla leaders opposing the American rebel forces in Central Jersey

Following the Revolutionary War in the 1780s New Jersey initially resisted the urge to free slaves due to a desire to rebuild their devastated economy According to the American historian Giles Wright by 1790 New Jerseys enslaved population numbered approximately 14000 They were virtually all of African descent The 1790 federal census however recorded 11423 slaves 62 percent of the total population of 184139 In the decades before the Revolution slaves were numerous near Perth Amboy a major point of entry and in the eastern counties Slaves were generally used for agricultural labor but they also filled skilled artisan jobs in shipyards and industry in coastal cities

Following the Revolutionary War New Jersey banned the importation of slaves in 1788 but at the same time forbade free blacks from elsewhere from settling in the state In the first two decades after the war many northern states rapidly abolished slavery and some slaveholders independently manumitted their slaves Some people of color left the areas where they had been enslaved and moved to more frontier areas Since slaves were widely used in agriculture as well as the ports the New Jersey state legislature was the last in the North to abolish slavery passing a law in 1804 for its gradual abolition The 1804 statute and subsequent laws freed children born after the law was passed African Americans born to slave mothers after July 4 1804 had to serve lengthy apprenticeships to the owners of their mothers Women were freed at 21 but men were not emancipated until the age of 25 Slaves who had been born before these laws were passed were considered after 1846 as indentured servants who were apprenticed for life

Although at first New Jersey allowed free people of color to vote the legislature disfranchised them in 1807 an exclusion that lasted until 1875 By 1830 twothirds of the slaves remaining in the North were held by masters in New Jersey as New York had freed the last of its slaves in 1827 under gradual abolition It was not until 1846 that New Jersey abolished slavery but it qualified it by redefining former slaves as apprentices who were apprenticed for life to their masters Slavery did not truly end in the state until it was ended nationally in 1865 after the American Civil War and passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution

According to historian James Gigantino University of Arkansas during the early nineteenth century in New Jersey there were more female than male slaves After the passage of the Act of Gradual Abolition in New Jersey in 1804 a greater number of advertisements in the state for the fulltitle sale of female slaves of childbearing age were published Female slaves and their reproductive capabilities were highly valuable because their children would be born as slaves for a term even after the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition However domestic skills and labor also affected the value and marketability of female slaves By 1830 African Americans made up 6 of the total population of New Jersey The city of New Brunswick had a large African American Population at an around 11 This added one of the reasons why New Brunswick was a favorable location for runaways but it also made the city into a popular site for slave hunters who wished to enforce The Fugitive Slave Laws of 1850 In more urban areas of the state like New Brunswick NJ there were a greater number of slave sale advertisements for female slaves prior to and postpassage of the 1804 Act of Gradual Abolition This was because female slaves were more highly favored for domestic work which was more prominent in urban spaces like New Brunswick Enslaved women however were not confined to this work and also performed manual labor across the state of New Jersey

Yet the Gradual Abolition Act of 1804 did not guarantee that a slave born after 1804 would gain their freedom Slaveholders would regularly sell those slaves down south to states like Louisiana before the slaves reached manumission age so they could make money off of them By the 1830s slavery was on the decline in New Jersey

Communities of free negros and freedmen formed at Dunkerhook in Paramus and at the New York state line at Skunk Hollow also called The Mountain A founding AfricanAmerican settler bought land there in 1806 and later bought more Other families joined him and the community continued into the twentieth century According to the historian David S Cohen in The Ramapo Mountain People 1974 free people of color migrated from Manhattan into other parts of the frontier of northeastern New Jersey where some intermarried and became ancestors of the Ramapo Mountain Indians Cohens findings have been disputed by some scholars including Albert J Catalano

According to Gigantino the efforts of New Jersey to legally abolish slavery during the years prior to the Civil War took a long period of time to officially abolish the practice claiming that one in ten slaves remained that way for life Many slaveholders sold their slaves to Southern slaveholders and displayed an apathy for abolition He stated that about one quarter of New Jerseys African American population was forced into labor during the 1830s Improper information regarding who was free led to it appearing as though slavery decreased more rapidly than it actually did

A total of 2909 United States Colored Troops from New Jersey served in the Union Army Because of the states longterm apprenticeship requirements at the close of the American Civil War some African Americans in New Jersey remained in bondage It was not until the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed in 1865 that the last 16 slaves in the state were freed

In the 1860 census free colored persons in New Jersey numbered 25318 about 4 of the states population of 672035 By 1870 the number had increased to 30658 but they constituted a smaller percentage of the total population because of the high rate of European immigration Overall New Jerseys population had increased to 906096 with nearly 200000 European immigrants

New Jersey was slow to abolish slavery and reluctant to pass the 13th Amendment which it did in January 1866 Some of its industries such as shoes and clothing had strong markets in the South supplying planters for their slaves which was probably a factor

On March 31 1870 Thomas Mundy Peterson 18241904 became the first African American to vote in an election under the justenacted provisions of the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution

In 1875 Jack Jackson who was described as the last slave in New Jersey died at the age of 87 on the Smith family farm at Secaucus In 1820 Abel Smith had manumitted his slaves but Jackson refused freedom and remained on the family estate until his death By the will of the late Abel Smith Jackson was interred in the family burial ground

In 2008 the New Jersey Legislature acknowledged the states role in the history of slavery in the United States

High School Never Ends
High School Never Ends is a song by American rock band Bowling for Soup The song was the first single from the groups sixth album The Great Burrito Extortion Case and was released on September 19 2006 The song deals with the frustration of graduating from high school and seeing that modern popular culture is very similar to the obnoxiously superficial and materialistic culture in high school

The tune had a prominent outside songwriter Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Tinted Windows working with the band It was heard in the promos in The Goldbergs spinoff Schooled

The song contains many references to the pop culture of the time Specific celebrities mentioned include MaryKate Olsen specifically her alleged eating disorder  How did Mary Kate lose all that weight Jessica Simpson youll never guess what Jessica did Bill Gates Bill Gates captain of the chess team Reese Witherspoon Reese Witherspoon shes the prom queen Jack Black Jack Black the clown Brad Pitt Brad Pitt the quarterback and Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes Katie had a baby so I guess Toms straight also a reference to his litigation against journalistspaparazzi who questioned his sexuality The song satirizes many aspects of todays society and its scrutiny of celebrity lives

Directed by Frank Borin the video focuses on the band members going to their high school reunion while another version of them performs the song onstage They arrive instantly recognizing people from the past that bullied them During a montage the band gets revenge on their former bullies in situations similar to their high school past

The first flashback shows Gary Wiseman getting a wedgie by some bullies who hang him on the flagpole by his underwear Gary takes his revenge by grabbing the underwear of the bully and pulling it over his head while he is still wearing it

The next flashback involves Erik Chandler getting a note reading kick me taped to his back by a jock Erik gets him back by sticking the punch bowl sign which simply reads PUNCH on his back this starts a queue of people ready to punch the jock including a nun a pimp a cowboy and a knight in armor

After the sequence of celebrities references Jaret Reddick invites a guy onstage who had embarrassed him at high school by pulling down his pants in front of a girl he was obviously keen of revealing his pink underwear Jaret pulls his pants down onstage as his act of revenge The popular guy then explodes in embarrassment after a sign stating TOO SMALL FOR TV appears strategically over his crotch

Finally Chris Burney has a flashback of him being slipped a laxative by a cheerleader and manages to get his own back by consuming a massive sub sandwich a chili removed from his pants a white mouse gasoline and a goldfish After jiggling around he then confronts the popular girl and presents the contents of his stomach upon herby projectile vomiting After Chris revenge the band finishes the song Jaret sticks his guitar pick to his rather sweaty forehead and the video ends with a disclaimer that states No animals or children under 15 were harmed in the making of this video

A separate edit of the song was recorded for Radio Disney which altered the lyrics throughout


On the week of November 25 2006 High School Never Ends debuted and peaked at number 97 on the Billboard Hot 100 before leaving the chart completely For the week ending January 28 2007 the song debuted at number 70 on the UK Singles Chart It peaked at number 40 the next week and remained on the chart for four weeks

Erlembald
Saint Erlembald or Erlembaldo Cotta Sanctus Herlembaldus in Latin died 15 April 1075 was the political and military leader of the movement known as the pataria in Milan a movement to reform the clergy and the church in the Ambrosian diocese

He was the brother of Landulf subdeacon of Milan They were of the Cotta a family of valvassores and vassals of the archdiocese In his early career Erlembald was referred to as a captain In 1063 he returned from a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and intended to become a monk when the deacon Ariald convinced him to take his brothers place at the head of the pataria Erlembald however was not a cleric but a soldier

In 1064 he travelled to Rome to confer with Pope Alexander II and confirm his support On his return to Milan he revealed the change in the character of the pataria by living in a palace near the church of Saint Victor and the Forty Martyrs With papal permission he began imposing his will by force on the clergy by deposing abbots and proceeding against the bishop Guido da Velate Guido was first accused of taking false oaths for not acting against simony in his province Guido however organised a resistance to the patarini Because of this Ariald imposed the interdict on the city during the feast of the Ascension The populace turned against him and he fled to Pavia After being captured en route to Rome Ariald was executed and his body thrown in Lake Maggiore On 3 May 1067 Erlembald recovered his body and reburied it in S Celso in Milan on 17 May Arialds popularity was also recovered after the lifting of the interdict A papal legation lent Erlembald much needed moral support at a congregation at Vallambrosa

In 1069 Guido renounced the see to Gotofredo da Castiglione with the support of the Emperor Henry IV Gotofredo was immediately besieged in his castle On 7 March 1070 violence broke out again in Milan and Gotofredo was arrested That year Guido request his archbishopric back from Erlembald He was refused but the patarino leader put him in S Celso and then in the see of Bergoglio On 6 January 1072 Erlembald appointed Atto archbishop in opposition to the arrested Gotofredo Strong opposition from the German court evaporated suddenly in 1073 when Henry was troubled by revolts in Saxony and had to ceded his rights in Milan to Pope Gregory VII Gregory confirmed Atto and lent his support to Erlembald

At this the height of his power an unfortunate fire broke out in the city and was interpreted as divine punishment for supporting the controversial pataria The opposition factions in Milan signed a pact against Erlembald He put down the revolt but was killed in the battle and buried in S Celso From 6 to 26 May in 1095 Pope Urban II was present at Milan for the transferral of the relics of the canonised Erlembald to S Dionigi He was already a propaganda tool at the time of the preaching of the First Crusade He was translated once more in 1528 to the Duomo His feast day is 27 July

He was born on July 24 1851 in Ipswich England Highams family immigrated to the United States when he was two years old and they settled in Hoboken New Jersey

During his career he was a very versatile player fielding multiples positions mainly as a right fielder and catcher with notable playing time as a second baseman as well In  he joined the New York Mutuals of the National Association during its inaugural season and played until the league was dissolved after the 1875 season serving as playermanager in 1874 He then moved on to the newly formed National League baseballs first recognized major league where he hit in the first NL triple play against the Mutuals on May 13  In  he served as captain of the Syracuse Stars in the inaugural year of the International League which was part of the League Alliance with whom the National League had a working relationship

After his playing days were over he served as an umpire for two years though rumors abounded that he was fixing games as a player However in  William G Thompson owner of the Detroit Wolverines and also mayor of Detroit got suspicious about some of the calls Higham made against his team He hired a private detective who turned up several letters between Higham and a wellknown gambler Higham outlined a simple codeif the gambler received a telegram from him saying Buy all the lumber you can the gambler was to bet on Detroit No telegram meant that the gambler was to bet on his opponent

As a result of this evidence Higham was fired as an umpire and banned from baseball To date he is the only umpire to have been banished from the game

Sndominic
Sndominic    is a commune in Harghita County Romania It lies in the Szkely Land an ethnocultural region in eastern Transylvania It is composed of a single village Sndominic

According to the 2002 census the commune has a population of 6401 with an absolute Szkely Hungarian majority of 6297 or 9838 There are also small minorities of Roma ethnic Romanians and Germans
Sndominic is religiously homogeneous with 986 of the population professing Roman Catholicism Unitarian Romanian Orthodox and Hungarian Reformed communities also exist

The name Sndominic is used for most official purposes but the population usually uses the shortened form Domokos

Sndominic is located in the upper reaches of the Olt valley 29 kilometres north of Miercurea Ciuc The mountain pass to the northwest leading to the village of Izvorul Mureului  and on to the large town of Gheorgheni marks the northern boundary of the traditional region of Felcsk

The northern reaches of the village follow the descent of the river Olt to the village centre Within the village limits the Lok and Szdakt brooks meet the river which then flows south to the village of Tometi In 1967 the northern village of Blan long a part of the commune but by then more populous than the central village gained official town status and was separated from Sndominic however the two settlements still share important economic and transport links

The village is served by the Izvorul Olt station of Romanian State Railways on the RzboieniTrgu MureDedaMiercurea CiucSfntu GheorgheBraov line

There is evidence of Szkely settlement on the site of Sndominic in the 14th century In the Middle Ages the village was the site of iron and copper mining a tradition carried on until very recently in Blan The name Zent Damokos appears in a document from 1567 The village gained notoriety for an incident of 3 November 1599 at the field of Psztorbkk On this day Szkely irregulars allied in the Long War with Michael the Brave  against the Hungarian nobility killed the Cardinal Andrs Bthory Prince of Transylvania who was retreating to Poland after being defeated in the Battle of elimbr The murderers were Mihly Andrs Kristly and Balzs Nagy later nicknamed Balzs rdg  Balzs the Devil and they were executed for their deed Pope Clement VIII responded by placing the whole village under interdict A Memorial Cross was erected in 1816 Its location is at a distance of 55km north of town on southeastern slope of the hill Fagul Ciobanului 1108 m

The village administratively belonged to Cskszk then from 1876 until 1918 to the Csk County of the Kingdom of Hungary In 1920 Sndominic like the rest of Transylvania formally passed with the Treaty of Trianon from Hungarian to Romanian control The region passed again to Hungary with the 1940 Treaty of the Belvedere also known as the Second Vienna Award In 1944 the village was the site of particularly bloody reprisals by Romanian irregulars participating in the recapture of Transylvania from this Hungarian control a small monument in the villages central square bears witness to the 14 victims among them an 86yearold woman After World War II it came under Romanian administration and became part of Romania in 1947 Between 1952 and 1960 it formed part of the Hungarian Autonomous Province then of the MureHungarian Autonomous Province until it was abolished in 1968 Since then the commune is part of Harghita County

Sndominics Roman Catholic church was constructed between 1787 and 1802 and still preserves numerous relics and treasures from the Middle Ages A Greek Catholic church was completed in 1787 and there is also a small Romanian Orthodox church Numerous chapels are scattered around the village including the chapel at Psztorbkk

A small village museum containing historic farm equipment costumes and weaponry has been installed in the upper floor of the former House of Culture The lower floor retains its function as a meetinghall and often hosts musical and theatrical events

Examples of the famous Szkely gates richly carved wooden gates often several metres in height can be seen throughout the village For this and other reasons Sndominic has long attracted the attention of ethnologists and anthropologists

Buchanan car
N H Buchanan Motor Co Pty Ltd was an Australian kit car manufacturer It made sports cars in the 1950s

The original body produced by Buchanan was a fibreglass item based on an Aston Martin DB3S racing car Buchanan borrowed a DB3S and pulled moulds from it while it was in Australia The styling was altered by filling in the scallops either side of the bonnet and reshaping the grille opening to be oval Because the target market was for rebodying of early model MGs the Buchanan moulds were cut and extended between the door openings and the rear wheelarches adding several centimetres to the body length

Racing car kits were also produced consisting of this type of body plus a fabricated Xframe racing chassis manufactured from steel channel sections welded face to face to form box sections The chassis used mechanicals from a Holden FJ with the front suspension crossmember and rear axle assembly being shortened to suit the narrower body

The Buchanan Cobra was introduced in 1958 as a production vehicle based on Standard 10 mechanicals Only 7 were manufactured

Buchanan Cobra number 1 was known to be sitting in an industrial shed in Warners Bay awaiting restoration as at November 2006

Buchanan Cobra number 3 is a complete running car and is raced through the Victorian Racing Register on a regular basis in Victoria as of May 2007 Attached is a current photograph of Cobra no3 being raced at Sandown in November 2013 car is owned and driven by Paul Schilling a member of the Victorian Racing Register and residing at Healesville in Victoria Cobra number 3 has recently undergone a facelift an engine rebuild a paint job electrical sorting and has appeared at Phillip Island Sandown Briant Park and Rob Roy hillclimbs and 2014 could be a big year for this cobra

Wally Mitchells MGYbased Holdenpowered Buchanan is currently undergoing a full ground up restoration by current owners Mathew Liersch and Clark Watson with an estimated completion date set for 2011

MTSL
MTSL S1oxyl2255tetramethyl25dihydro1Hpyrrol3ylmethyl methanesulfonothioate is an organosulfur compound that is used as a nitroxide spin label MTSL is bifunctional consisting of the nitroxide and the thiosulfonate ester functional groups The nitroxide label is sterically protected so it is relatively unreactive

MTSL is attached to proteins by reaction with thiol groups The reaction exploits standard reactivity of thiosulfate esters Sulfinic acid CHSOH is the leaving group
The heterodisulfide bond to the cysteine residue is robust enabling sitedirected spin labelling The MTSL moiety will add 1843 daltons to the mass of the protein or peptide to which it is attached The cysteine can be introduced using sitedirected mutagenesis and hence most positions in a protein can be labelled

In Nuclear magnetic resonance the introduction of the paramagnetic group increases the relaxation rate of nearby nuclei Its presence can be detected as peak broadening and loss of intensity in peaks corresponding to nearby nuclei Hence proximity can be inferred for all nuclei that are affected A major advantage of this method over traditional methods for obtaining distance restraints in protein NMR is the increased length as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement can detect distances up to 25  25 nm as opposed to about 6  06nm using the nuclear Overhauser effect Spin labelling with MTSL is frequently used in investigation of residual structure in intrinsically unstructured proteins

San Sombrro
San Sombrro subtitled A Land of Carnivals Cocktails and Coups is a parody travel guide book examining the eponymous fictional country described as the birthplace of tinted sunglasses and sequins This country is set in Central America and was created by Australian comedic writers Tom Gleisner Santo Cilauro and Rob Sitch of The DGeneration and The Panel fame

In Spanish San Sombrro would be translated into English as Saint Hat San being the shortened word for the Spanish word santo meaning saint and sombrero no accent mark in realworld Spanish meaning hat

According to the book the full and technically correct name of San Sombrro is the Democratic Free Peoples United Republic of San Sombrro and citizens may be arrested without a warrant if the title is not used

The Democratic Free Peoples United Republic of San Sombrro is a composite of many stereotypes and clichs about Central America and South America It would be difficult to position the fictional San Sombro on a map of Central America Although it is presented as a thin country between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea similar to Panama it runs diagonally from northeast to southwest in comparison to the other states on the Central American strip of land that run more from the northwest to southeast or west to east If San Sombrro were to be geographically placed it would probably fit best between Panama and Costa Rica

The book says the nation has 362 separate public holidays not including the carnivale long weekend San Sombrro appears to be a stereotypically corrupt and unstable banana republic with seemingly endless revolutions and counterrevolutions The country is said to have had 17 different presidents over 10 years

San Sombrro is described as having a very high literacy rate because of an antiilliteracy campaign in which over 53000 citizens who were unable to read were jailed or deported to Haiti

Before the arrival of the Spanish San Sombrro was said to inhabited by several AmerIndian ethnic groups called the Ciboney Siboney Nomadic huntergatherers Taino who lived on seafood Puorcina who practiced simple agriculture and the most dominant Guanajaxo they just stole from everyone else But there was a tribe that existed before called the Bollivquar fierce warriors who regarded themselves as a very complex and advanced society which is said to be odd because they never quite mastered fire irrigation or star jumps But they learnt how to farm tobacco which to this day still remains a part of the Bollivquar diet explaining their stunted growth Note that their inability to light a fire made it harder to take up smoking

San Sombrro is a Spanishspeaking country but a dialect has developed known as San Sombrran which combines Castilian grammar Portuguese pronunciation and indigenous shouting San Sombrran Spanish is spoken a lot faster than normal Spanish because it is considered impolite for people to take a breath during a sentence particularly since their breath is so foul San Sombrran Spanish has many English loanwords some of which are beisbol  baseball hamburgesa  hamburger these two are actual Spanish words beeras  beers and dryvebyshooting  drive by shooting

The San Sombrran national anthem is O Patria Gloriosa O Glorious Motherland written in 1853 by independence leader Juan Robirro who is famous for uttering He who loves his country lives forever shortly before falling off a ladder and dying The national anthem is set to a bossa nova beat and loyal citizens of San Sombrro will stand respectfully place a hand on each hip and start to gyrate while the anthem is played


The flag of San Sombrro is the Camouflagio which resembles military camouflage with a narrow vertical white stripe on the left side When the nation first became independent from Spain a dirty red and white chequered tablecloth made an impromptu flag

The capital city of San Sombrro is Cucaracha City in Polluin There are five provinces in San Sombrro including Polluin the other provinces are 

The book advertises fictional guides on the following places Unaudited Arab Emirates the Middle East Costa Lottsa akin to Monaco the Barbituros Islands the Caribbean Alpenstein the Alps Tyranistan Former Soviet Union Nukula Atoll Polynesia frozen Norgborg Scandinavia and the miserable Isle of Fogg North Sea It also advertises its websites forum as well as world tours for botanists and golfers and an opportunity to spend a year in an untouched part of Europe

The book ends with The Jetlag Story

Tsumasabur Band
Bantsuma birth name Denkichi Tamura was born in Kodenmach Nihonbashi Tokyo Bantsumas father a cotton wholesaler named Chgor lived till the age of 71 but his mother older brother and sister died when he was young He attended Jisshi Elementary School which stands next to the former site of Denmach Prison where many the loyal supporters of the Emperor whom he frequently played in his films were deeply involved At school he was often the leader of the pack and was actively involved in plays While performing in a school play Bantsuma froze on stage unable to recite his lines Embarrassed he ran off and stayed in his room weeping for 10 days It is said that during this time he vowed to become someone who would be admired by all

After the death of his mother his fathers business soon went bankrupt and Bantsuma was unable to continue his education After finishing elementary school he became an apprentice and pupil to Kataoka Nizaemon a famous kabuki actor However in the world of kabuki lineage was extremely important and Bantsuma struggled to gain fame He soon changed his artistic direction by joining small theaters and taking small roles at Kokkatsu production firm In 1922 with Kichimatsu Nakamura he formed the Bando Tsumasaburo Troupe but it was disbanded very quickly In 1923 Bantsuma and Kichimatsu were scouted into the film industry by Makino Film Studio

Once he joined Makino Film Productions he began to build a celebrated career as an actor It was during this period that he became best friends with Rokuhei Susukita a script writer who wrote almost a hundred scripts for the Makino studio He introduced complex plot lines exhilarating action sequences and unruly anarchy to jidaigeki films very much in the style of American films Rokuhei subsequently selected Bantsuma to debut in his film Gyakuryo in 1924 a story about a poor lowrank samurai whose life is turned upside down by his enemy In 1925 Bantsuma starred in Kageboshi another screenplay written by Rokuhei this time depicting the life of the jovial thief Kageboshi

At the height of his fame Bantsuma established his own agency in the summer of 1925 It was the first independent production company to be headed by a film star in the history of Japanese cinema Bantsuma owned most of the rights and would go through the specific scenes and details with the directors He is said to have been very demanding but his colleagues have explained that this was merely a reflection of his eager and enthusiastic approach to making films During this time Bantsuma practically lived in Gion being entertained by geisha It is also well known that he liked to flaunt his cash and he often treated his coworkers to a night in Gion with sometimes up to 20 geisha in one room In 1926 Bantsuma built a studio outside Kyoto where the Toei Kyoto studio now stands

By far the most controversial film made under Bantsuma Productions was its second production Orochi 1925 The story revolves around the protagonist Heizaburo Kuritomi an honorable but lowclass samurai who is given an emotional depth previously unseen in jidaigeki films as he battles with inner conflict and the injustices of society This is especially evident in the closing sequence of the film where the protagnoist is dragged away by his enemies after his tremendous effort to protect his love In the essay Bantsumas New Breeze Midori Sawato cites the ending of Orochi as one of the most heroic and heartcrushing images she has seen In the past the heroes of the films were proud samurai of the upper classes who always triumphed over their evil opponents upholding what was truly right in the world However Orochi was created in response to the national and military fanaticism that was prevailing at the time

With its now famous opening lines Not all those who wear the name of villain are truly evil men Not all those who are respected as noble men are worthy of the name Many are those who wear a false mask of benevolence to hide their treachery and the wickedness of their true selves the film evoked provocative ideologies and rebellious ideas during a time where liberal performers and writers were being repressed throughout Japan Consequently the film was severely censored with over 20 of its content being completely cut out and several scenes having to be reshot When the film was finally released the hype around its creation resulted in crowds flocking to theaters all around the country Bantsumas exhilarating new sword fighting style he displayed in the film may have attracted audiences but it cannot be denied that there were many who were also deeply touched by the profound message of the film

Bantsuma went on to produce many films under his production company but Orochi was the only one he personally kept the negative for His agency hit a low point during the period 19311935 During this time his production company was very much a oneman agency where the directors were only acting to please Bantsuma His acting skills gradually became old and outdated so his films did not do very well In 1935 Bantsuma worked with the renowned director Hiroshi Inagaki in his first talkie film Niino Tsuruchiyo 1935 but his rather feeble voice was unpopular with the audience It seemed that Bantsumas luck was running out and in 1936 he closed the doors of his agency once and for all and joined Nikkatsu Production Company in 1937

Bantsumas films particularly his earlier works would not be complete without the fastpaced sword fighting scenes that always guaranteed to raise the heart rate of his audience Fighting styles had always been set especially in Kabuki performances and actors were limited to doing standard moves such as the Yamagata Yanagi or the Chijihataka However with the emergence of Bantsuma this changed and he introduced a completely new style which was unique to him alone Ryu Kuze a sword fighting coach analyzed Bantsumas technique and put his uniqueness down to the fact that he does not look at his victims when he slays them Instead he is already focused on his next victim Ryu Kuze also pointed out that Bantsuma would stand straight with his ankles lined up which was his signature pose that signaled death for his opponent His colleagues often spoke of their admiration for Bantsumas enthusiasm and quick ability to pick up new moves and sequences Bantsumas spectacular sword skills soon earned him the title The King of Swordfights

Bantsumas first son Takahiro Tamura described his father as sensitive and affected by everything occurring around him He wrote several articles for magazines such as Bantsuma Cinema News and displayed his sensitivity as well as giving the audience an insight into his mentality

In the November 1929 issue of Bantsuma Cinema News he wrote The life of an artist is to die for art Only when art is ones life can one produce real art As I have a long way to go I will continue down this path while with such belief

His determination and dedication in what he did is evident in the statement he made in the February 1930 issue of the same magazine He wrote When creating such a film I am not an actor but actually am in the shoes of the character in the film feeling what he feels and I suffer the same agony as that character I must play numerous characters and their diverse personalities one after another I am no God Sometimes I feel myself screaming insideyou cannot claim with confidence that you are speaking the mind of the character with only a halfdeveloped understanding of that character Being able to fully depict the character comes only after bleeding and suffering in agony in the process

Bantsuma was truly a man of many talents

Bantsuma and his wife Shizuko Tamura had four sons together  Takahiro Tamura Masakazu Tamura Ry Tamura and Toshima Tamura Three followed in their fathers footsteps launching careers in the movie industry Toshima became a businessperson

His first son Takahiro Tamura who died on 16 May 2006 from a cerebral infarction often spoke fondly about his father in interviews and gave valuable insights

The family often spent their summers at the beach in Amanohashidate and as Takahiro recalled Bantsuma would splash around in the water even more excited than his brothers He also spoke of the memory of his fathers reaction to the results of his junior high school examination Too nervous to go to the school and check the good news was delivered by the teacher Takahiro distinctly remembered his father bounding down the stairs and bowing in front of the teacher till his forehead touched the floor almost as if shooting a scene from one of his jidaigeki films

Many people think that Bantsumas true nature can be seen in Yabure Daiko 1949 where he plays the role of a tyrannical man feared by his family He was the complete opposite always putting his family first The role he played in Abare Jishi of a father who would do anything for his children is a more accurate representation of Bantsuma who was an affectionate and wellrounded family man However Bantsumas dedication to his work was also strong and he returned to the set ready to work the day after his wedding

It seems that Bantsumas sensitivity was beginning to make its way into the work he was producing A year after entering Nikkatsu Bantsuma costarred with Kataoka Chiezo in the allstar film Chushingura 1938 Playing the role of Kuranosuke Oishi Bantsuma displayed his perfected acting skills with his powerful performance Then in 1943 he starred in the film Muho matsu no Issho playing a poor rickshaw man It was a role that would not normally have been taken on by such a great star but director Hiroshi Inagaki whom Bantsuma had previously worked with was determined to get him on board After initially turning down the role Bantsuma finally agreed and went on to play a role with a profound humanistic approach that lent great depth to both the character and the movie In preparation for the role of the poor rickshaw man Bantsuma stayed in character even whilst at home His first son Takahiro Tamura described watching his father eat dried fish and drink sake in the style of the character of the film

During this period of his career Japan soon lost the war and the US army began to restrict Jidaigeki as a hotbed of feudalism Thus the stars of Jidaigeki formed troupes and traveled around the country During this time Bantsuma perfected his skills further and in 1948 he peaked once again with his performance in the film sh Director Daisuke It spoke of Bantsumas wide range and depth his convincing and humanistic portrayal of the protagonist and stated that despite his big status in the film industry Bantsuma was the obvious choice for the part of Sankichi a man of the lowest social ranks

On 7 July 1953 Bantsuma died at the age of 51 of cerebral hemorrhage while filming AbareJishi A beautiful grave has been built in his memory in Nisonin Kyoto and Bantsuma lives on through the continued popularity of his films and the impact he made to the history of Japanese cinema

Shire of Waroona
The Shire of Waroona is a local government area in the Peel region of Western Australia between Mandurah and Harvey and about 110kilometres 68mi south of Perth the state capital The Shire covers an area of about 835km 322mi and its seat of government is the town of Waroona

The district was originally controlled by the Murray Road Board from 1887 In 1898 the Drakesbrook Road Board was gazetted Years after the renaming of the town on 19 May 1961 the Drakesbrook Road Board was abolished It was to become the Waroona Road Board but due to changes in the Local Government Act approved earlier in the year it became the Waroona Shire Council on 1 July 1961 in line with many other councils

The shire no longer has wards it is made up of eight councillors who represent the whole of the Shire

The Shire of Waroona contains the following towns and localities

Trichoptilosis
Trichoptilosis from the Greek  tricho hair and the New Latin ptilosis arrangement of feathers in definite areas from the Greek  ptilon feather schizotrichia and informally split ends is the splitting or fraying of the hairshaft due to excessive heat and mechanical stress

Thermal chemical or mechanical stress can cause split ends For example the use of curling irons and other heat treatments may cause split ends Excessive application of hair products such as perms and hair coloring may strip protective layering off the outside of the hairs shaft and weaken the hair making the hair prone to split ends Mechanical stresses include pulling a comb forcefully through tangled hair and repeated combing Split ends can be seen as a symptom of copper transport disorders such as Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome Rubbing the hair up towards the scalp does not cause split ends
There is no remedy for split ends beyond trimming the affected hair

Some products claim to heal split ends by sealing the ends back together

Reducing or eliminating the causes will usually prevent split ends Trimming the ends of the hair at least every 6 10 weeks may prevent split ends Also hair at the highest risk for splitting can be removed

Mestranol
Mestranol sold under the brand names Enovid Norinyl and OrthoNovum among others is an estrogen medication which has been used in birth control pills menopausal hormone therapy and the treatment of menstrual disorders It is formulated in combination with a progestin and is not available alone It is taken by mouth
Side effects of mestranol include nausea breast tension edema and breakthrough bleeding among others It is an estrogen or an agonist of the estrogen receptors the biological target of estrogens like estradiol Mestranol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol in the body
Mestranol was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in 1957 It was the estrogen component in the first birth control pill In 1969 mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most birth control pills although mestranol continues to be used in a few birth control pills even today Mestranol remains available only in a few countries including the United States United Kingdom Japan and Chile

Mestranol was employed as the estrogen component in many of the first oral contraceptives such as mestranolnoretynodrel brand name Enovid and mestranolnorethisterone brand names OrthoNovum Norinyl and is still in use today In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive mestranol has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms

Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver with a conversion efficiency of 70 50g of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35g of ethinylestradiol or ethinylestradiol being about 17times as orally potent by weight as mestranol It has been found to possess 01 to 23 of the relative binding affinity of estradiol 100 for the estrogen receptor compared to 75 to 190 for ethinylestradiol

The elimination halflife of mestranol has been reported to be 50minutes The elimination halflife of the active form of mestranol ethinylestradiol is 7 to 36hours

The effective ovulationinhibiting dosage of mestranol has been studied

Mestranol also known as ethinylestradiol 3methyl ether EEME or as 17ethynyl3methoxyestra13510trien17ol is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol 17ethynylestradiol with a methyl ether at the C3 position

In April 1956 noretynodrel was investigated in Puerto Rico in the first largescale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate in the country and concerns of moral censure in the United States It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts 12 of the 3methyl ether of ethinylestradiol noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol When this impurity was removed higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred As a result mestranol that same year 1956 was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol given its name and added back to the formulation This resulted in Enovid by G D Searle  Company the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 985mg noretynodrel and 150g mestranol per pill

Around 1969 mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogencontaining oral contraceptives The rationale was that ethinylestradiol was approximately twice as potent by weight as mestranol and hence that the dose could be halved which it was thought might result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed

Mestranol is the generic name of the drug and its      and  while mestranolo is its 

Mestranol has been marketed under a variety of brand names mostly or exclusively in combination with progestins including Devocin Enavid Enovid Femigen Mestranol Norbiogest OrthoNovin OrthoNovum Ovastol and Tranel among others Today it continues to be sold in combination with progestins under brand names including Lutedion Necon Norinyl OrthoNovum and Sophia

Mestranol remains available only in the United States the United Kingdom Japan and Chile It is only marketed in combination with progestins such as norethisterone

Mestranol has been studied as a male contraceptive and was found to be highly effective At a dosage of 045mgday it suppressed gonadotropin levels reduced sperm count to zero within 4 to 6weeks and decreased libido erectile function and testicular size Gynecomastia occurred in all of the men These findings contributed to the conclusion that estrogens would be unacceptable as contraceptives for men

Pataria
The pataria was an eleventhcentury religious movement in the Archdiocese of Milan in northern Italy aimed at reforming the clergy and ecclesiastic government in the province and supportive of Papal sanctions against simony and clerical marriage Those involved in the movement were called patarini also patarines or patarenes from singular patarino a word chosen by their opponents which means ragpickers from Milanese patee rags In general the patarini were tradesmen motivated by personal piety The conflict between the patarini and their supporters and the partisans of the simoniacal archbishops eventually led to civil war by the mid1070s the Great Saxon revolt It received its most dependable contemporary chronicler in Arnulf of Milan

The pataria was partially the result of church reform movements like the Peace and Truce of God and partially of the social situation in Milan The influence of southern French movements such as the Peace and Truce affected the pataria The subsequent popularity of the Cathar movement in Milan during the twelfth century was resultant of the pataria The chief targets of the patarini were the rich secular aristocratic landowners and the simoniacal and nicolaitan clergy They contested the ancient rights of the cathedral clergy of Milan and supported the Gregorian reforms They joined with the lesser clergy in opposition to the practices of simony and of clerical marriage and concubinage The morals of the clergy were attacked too as was monastic discipline The contrast between the impoverished lesser clergy and the magnates of the Church resurfaced as a point of contention

The archbishop Guido da Velate was a particular victim of the patarini On the death in 1045 of the warrior and princebishop Ariberto da Intimiano the Milanese requested the Emperor Henry III who controlled the election of bishops in his realms to choose from among four candidates deemed retti ed onesti upright and honest Anselmo da Baggio Arialdo da Carimate Landolfo Cotta and Attone The Emperors choice however fell upon the thoroughly worldly Guido known for his support of the practice of clerical marriage and concubinage which was generally accepted in rural areas and which was now being given the name nicolaism recalling a passage in the Book of Revelation 26 1415

Guido however did not fulfill his vows to fight simony and was forced to resign The patarini initially protested the abuse by their refusal to accept communion at the hands of priests with unofficial wives or concubines Some churches were emptied while others were packed with the faithful The movement formed behind its leaders the four rejected upright and honest priests To defuse the situation the emperor named Anselmo da Baggio bishop of Lucca which carried him securely away from Milan and the archbishop excommunicated the intractable Arialdo da Carimate and Landolfo Cotta

Following the pontificate of Benedict IX the papacy too began to sense the urgency of reform and Pope Leo IX condemned both the practice of simony and concubinage among priests When Landolfo Cotta attempted to present the position of the Milanese patarini before Pope Stephen IX the archbishops ruffians caught up with him at Piacenza and came near to killing him A second attack in 1061 was successful In 1060 Pope Nicholas II sent a delegation to Milan under the direction of Peter Damiani and Anselmo da Baggio and calm was restored to the city

After Landolfos death his brother Erlembald stepped in to take his place He transferred the movement from one primarily socioreligious to principally military The pataria at this moment received the support of Popes Alexander II and Gregory VII while the Ambrosian see fell into schism and war until the archiepiscopate of Anselm III reestablished order

The Occitan word pataric later became a synonym for Cathar The wife of the troubadour Raimon Jordan was a reported pataric There were also rumours emanating from a Christian prisoner in Alexandria that the Patarenes had made an alliance with the Muslims against the Crusaders These rumours captivated Joachim of Fiore who built on it an apocalyptic theory of the union of the beast from the sea and the beast from the land

Siegel modular form
In mathematics Siegel modular forms are a major type of automorphic form These stand in relation to the conventional elliptic modular forms as abelian varieties do in relation to elliptic curves the complex manifolds constructed as in the theory are basic models for what a moduli space for abelian varieties with some extra level structure should be as quotients of the Siegel upper halfspace rather than the upper halfplane by discrete groups

The modular forms of the theory are holomorphic functions on the set of symmetric n  n matrices with positive definite imaginary part the forms must satisfy an automorphy condition Siegel modular forms can be thought of as multivariable modular forms ie as special functions of several complex variables

Siegel modular forms were first investigated by for the purpose of studying quadratic forms analytically These primarily arise in various branches of number theory such as arithmetic geometry and elliptic cohomology Siegel modular forms have also been used in some areas of physics such as conformal field theory

Let formula1 and define

the Siegel upper halfspace Define the symplectic group of level formula3 denoted by formula4 as 

where formula6 is the formula7 identity matrix Finally let 

be a rational representation where formula9 is a finitedimensional complex vector space

Given 

and 

define the notation 

Then a holomorphic function

is a Siegel modular form of degree formula14 sometimes called the genus weight formula15 and level formula3 if 

for all formula18
In the case that formula19 we further require that formula20 be holomorphic at infinity This assumption is not necessary for formula21 due to the Koecher principle explained below Denote the space of weight formula15 degree formula14 and level formula3 Siegel modular forms by 

Some methods for constructing Siegel modular forms include

For degree 1 the level 1 Siegel modular forms are the same as level 1 modular forms The ring of such forms is a polynomial ring CEE in the degree 1 Eisenstein series E and E

For degree 2 showed that the ring of level 1 Siegel modular forms is generated by the degree 2 Eisenstein series E and E and 3 more forms of weights 10 12 and 35 The ideal of relations between them is generated by the square of the weight 35 form minus a certain polynomial in the others

For degree 3 described the ring of level 1 Siegel modular forms giving a set of 34 generators
For degree 4 the level 1 Siegel modular forms of small weights have been found There are no cusp forms of weights 2 4 or 6 The space of cusp forms of weight 8 is 1dimensional spanned by the Schottky form The space of cusp forms of weight 10 has dimension 1 the space of cusp forms of weight 12 has dimension 2 the space of cusp forms of weight 14 has dimension 3 and the space of cusp forms of weight 16 has dimension 7 

For degree 5 the space of cusp forms has dimension 0 for weight 10 dimension 2 for weight 12 The space of forms of weight 12 has dimension 5

For degree 6 there are no cusp forms of weights 0 2 4 6 8 The space of Siegel modular forms of weight 2 has dimension 0 and those of weights 4 or 6 both have dimension 1

For small weights and level 1 give the following results for any positive degree

The following table combines the results above with information from and and 

The theorem known as the Koecher principle states that if formula20 is a Siegel modular form of weight formula15 level 1 and degree formula21 then formula20 is bounded on subsets of formula30 of the form 

where formula32 Corollary to this theorem is the fact that Siegel modular forms of degree formula21 have Fourier expansions and are thus holomorphic at infinity

Pink song
Pink is a song by American rock band Aerosmith It was written by Steven Tyler and professional songwriters Richie Supa and Glen Ballard It was released as the third major single from Nine Lives in 1997

The song reached No27 on the Billboard Hot 100 No38 in the United Kingdom and No19 in Latvia It also topped the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks

The band rereleased the song in the United Kingdom in 1999 The rereleased version did much better reaching No13

The song is highlighted by a harmonica performance by Steven Tyler at the beginning as well as a strong bass rhythm throughout the song and a mix of acoustic guitars and jangling electric guitars throughout the verses

Many of the lines in the verses start with the word pink eg Pink its my new obsession  Pink its not even a question Pink on the lips of your lover The song is also highly suggestive in that the origin of the fascination with pink stems from the admiration of a womans reproductive organs particularly the inner side of the outer lips  the pink in the middle  and also the mans penis  I wanna wrap you in rubber and my favorite crayon

The music video for the song used CGI to morph characters faces to other bodies A variety of random characters mixed in with band members moving towards the camera morphing into different characters in the process eg Joe Perry as a centaur Brad Whitford as a little boy Steven Tyler as a skeleton and a boy dressed as the Easter Bunny It was directed by Doug Nichol

Two versions of the music video exist In the uncensored version there is a woman dressed in a blue jumpsuit walking towards the camera For a brief second the top unzipped portion of the jumpsuit is pulled away revealing her right breast There is another instance where a womans breasts are briefly fully revealed when a woman painted blue and green does a pirouette

The uncensored version caused minor controversy and MTV asked Nichol to censor the video for daytime airings As a result the edited version censored the pirouette scene The clean version also shows Tyler and Perry presented as a twoheaded man and only the coverup portion of the breast reveal scene is present

The 1997 release cover art had the Aerosmith logo drawn as if it were by a child in a pink background In the 1999 rerelease the cover art features the Aerosmith logo and eight stills from the music video

As of 2007 Pink is one of only two songs from Nine Lives consistently played on Aerosmith tours along with Falling in Love Is Hard on the Knees

A different version of the song The South Beach ReMix was included on the careerspanning compilation O Yeah Ultimate Aerosmith Hits

Japanese edition of the Pink single from Nine Lives features six tracks three mixes of Pink Album Version The South Beach Mix  Live from the Howard Stern Radio Show plus live versions of Falling In Love Is Hard On The Knees  Walk This Way recorded in March 1997 As well there is a techno remix of Falling in Love Is Hard On The Knees titled Moby Fucked Remix

It is a bonus playable song in the video game  and the only track from Nine Lives present in the game In the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of this game the word high in Pink gets me high as a kite is removed

The song won the band their fourth and most recent Grammy award in 1999 for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal

Additionally the video won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video in 1998

In March 2016 she was hired as a political columnist for Guardian US In 2019 she received widespread criticism from journalists after her book Merchants Of Truth was found to contain plagiarized passages and numerous factual errors though Abramsons book was praised for its accuracy by Donald Trump

In 2012 she was ranked number five on Forbes list of most powerful women She was also named as one of the 500 most powerful people in the world by Foreign Policy
Abramson was born in New York City and grew up in a Jewish home She received her high school diploma from Ethical Culture Fieldston School and a BA in History and Literature from Harvard University and Radcliffe College in 1976

While a Harvard undergraduate she was the Arts Editor of The Harvard Independent and worked at Time magazine from 1973 to 1976 Subsequently she spent nearly a decade as a senior staff reporter for The American Lawyer In 1986 she was appointed as editor in chief of Legal Times in Washington DC serving for two years From 1988 to 1997 she was a senior reporter in the Washington bureau of The Wall Street Journal eventually rising to deputy bureau chief She joined The New York Times in 1997 becoming its Washington bureau chief in December 2000

Abramson was the Times Washington Bureau chief during the turbulent period of Spring 2003 during the runup to the war in Iraq and the Jayson Blair scandal which led to the resignation of Executive Editor Howell Raines and Managing Editor Gerald Boyd In a February 2013 interview Abramson spoke of the conflict she had with Raines as DC bureau chief saying Howell from the getgo just had no use for me  I did think about quitting Abramson was named to the news managing editor position with coManaging Editor John M Geddes by Raines successor Bill Keller

In 1995 Abramson and her The Wall Street Journal colleague and fellow Fieldston alumna Jane Mayer coauthored Strange Justice The Selling of Clarence Thomas which detailed circumstances surrounding the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas Maureen Dowd would later write of having bonded with Abramson during that time From 2000 to 2001 she was a professor at Princeton University She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001

In February 2007 Abramson testified in the perjury trial of Scooter Libby United States v Libby She was called as a defense witness to undercut the credibility of Judith Miller

In 2010 it was announced that Abramson was going to work on news content on the Times website for six months

On June 2 2011 it was announced that Abramson would become the executive editor of the Times in September 2011 replacing Bill Keller who would step down from the position to become a fulltime writer

Abramson was scheduled to address the commencement exercises of Barnard College on May 14 2012 Her speech was canceled after President Barack Obama requested to speak instead She received an honorary degree at Fairleigh Dickinsons 69th Commencement Ceremony in May 2012

In April 2013 Abramson was the subject of a sharply critical profile in Politico written by Dylan Byers entitled Turbulence at the Times in which anonymous Times staffers called her impossible and very very unpopular Abramson was deeply distressed by the report later saying it made her cry

On May 14 2014 it was announced that Abramson had been fired from her position as executive editor of the Times and that Dean Baquet would succeed her in that role Abramson was reportedly fired because of her arbitrary decisionmaking a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her inadequate communication and mistreatment of colleagues Five days later she delivered the commencement address at Wake Forest University 

During the runup to the 2016 US presidential election Abramson argued in a column for Guardian US that Hillary Clinton whom she had covered as a reporter and editor since the Whitewater controversy was fundamentally honest and trustworthy

On February 19 2018 Abramson followed up her 1995 book on Clarence Thomas and the Anita Hill hearings with a discussion concerning new evidence that Thomas had committed perjury which might be tied to possible impeachment Abramson indicated that her reporting was initiated by an article by the journalist Marcia Coyle from 2016 when Abramson stated Tipped to the post by a Maryland legal source who knew Smith who made the allegations Marcia Coyle a highly regarded and scrupulously nonideological Supreme Court reporter for The National Law Journal wrote a detailed story about Moira Smiths allegation of buttsqueezing which included corroboration from Smiths roommates at the time of the dinner and from her former husband Coyles story which Thomas denied was published October 27 2016
In December 2018 Fox News reported that Abramsons book Merchants of Truth criticized her former employer the Times of abandoning objectivity and becoming antiTrump to bolster profits Abramson responded by stating that the Fox News review distorts and takes what I wrote totally out of context and praised the Times along with The Washington Post for their superb coverage of the corruption enveloping the Trump administration the best investigative reporting Ive seen

In February 2019 Vice News correspondent Michael C Moynihan said Abramsons book Merchants of Truth contained several instances of plagiarism posting a series of tweets comparing passages of the book to passages of other publications including Time Out The Ryerson Review of Journalism The New Yorker The Columbia Journalism Review and other works In a February 7 interview on Fox News Abramson said she had no comment on the plagiarism accusations but later that evening said she would review the passages in question However in an interview with NPRs Michel Martin Abramson admitted that she fell short in attributing her sources for some passages of the book In an interview with CNNs Brian Stelter Abramson said that most of the plagiarized text was cited in footnotes but that was she was sorry that a few piece of text were not Stelter pointed out to Abramson that lifting words from other sources and citing footnotes is still considered plagiarism

In 1981 she married Harvard classmate Henry Little Griggs III Griggs was then president of Triad a political public relations company He is selfdescribed as a writer editor and mediarelations consultant specializing in nonprofit advocacy campaigns They have two children

In May 2007 Abramson was seriously injured in a truckpedestrian crash near the New York Times headquarters in Times Square She subsequently filed a lawsuit against the trucks driver owner and operator who was involved in the crash as well two companies involved in the crash

Abramson has four tattoos on her body that she describes as telling the story of me They include a New York City Subway token the letter H representing her alma mater Harvard University and her husband Henry and the letter T in the Gothic font of the New York Times logo Abramson first unveiled her New York Times tattoo on a New York interview show less than a month before being fired from the paper saying that it along with the H tattoo represent the two institutions that I revere that have shaped me She has called her Times tattoo which is emblazoned on her back her personal hieroglyphic However although she worked at The Wall Street Journal for 10 years she elected not be similarly marked by that newspaper because It just wasnt in my familys blood

In December 2002 Prodrive purchased Glenn Seton Racing and renamed it Ford Performance Racing as part of a marketing push to link the Prodriveowned Ford Performance Vehicles road car range to the popular V8 Supercars Along with this renaming came a huge expansion programme  the team expanded from one car driven by Glenn Seton to three Seton Craig Lowndes and David Besnard The team moved into a new headquarters adjacent to the FPV factory in Campbellfield Melbourne and the crew expanded as well The third car was entered using Rod Nash Racings Racing Entitlement Contract REC While other teams such had received major Ford support in the years since it became the first official Ford factory team since the Ford Works Team of 1962 to 1973

The teams early years were somewhat disappointing given the fact the team was one of the best funded in V8 Supercars Lowndes had his moments in 2003 including a round win at Phillip Island and a secondplace finish at Bathurst driving with Seton Lowndes finished the year 5th in the championship with Seton and Besnard well down the order In 2004 the team downsized to two cars Lowndes and Seton both had disappointing years plagued by engine dramas a lack of test days and a lack of comparable data their cars were built to different specifications While the pair did start to find some pace at the end of the year they finished second at Bathurst again they both decided to move at the end of the year  Lowndes to Triple Eight Race Engineering and Seton to Dick Johnson Racing

Jason Bright and Greg Ritter joined for the 2005 season Bright had a consistent year and finished inside the top 10 while Ritter was disappointing David Brabham replaced him for the final two rounds In 2006 Mark Winterbottom joined the team Bright scored multiple frontrow starts including three pole positions He won the inaugural round in Bahrain the Desert 400 and came 6th in the championship Winterbottom enjoyed a very consistent run to finish third in the championship The pair won the Sandown 500 FPR came second in the teams championship behind the HSV Dealer Team

Bright left FPR at the end of the 2006 season to drive for his own Britek Motorsport outfit with Steven Richards recruited to replace him The team continued to take the challenge to the frontrunning teams The most disappointing moment in 2007 was when Winterbottom left the circuit late in the race while leading at Bathurst In 2008 Winterbottom challenged for the championship but Jamie Whincup managed to finish the championship ahead of Winterbottom while Richards finished 8th

In 2009 the new FG Falcon was debuted While Triple Eight already had the speed FPR struggled with only one win from Mark Winterbottom during the season with Steven Richards finishing a best of 3rd The team also struggled at Bathurst again with the No 6 car driven by Winterbottom and Richards caught fire on lap 50 while the second car driven by Dean Canto and Luke Youlden crashed late in the race Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards finished 5th and 13th in the championship

In 2015 Ford Performance Racing was renamed as Prodrive Racing Australia as a result of Fords decision to progressively withdraw its V8 Supercars support by 2016 The team introduced the Ford FG X Falcon the first new Falcon since 2009 After a slow start the team achieved considerable success in the next section of the season with eleven out of fifteen race wins between the third event the Perth Super Sprint and the eighth event the Sydney Motorsport Park Super Sprint Winterbottom codriving with Steve Owen then went on to win the 2015 Wilson Security Sandown 500 leading home a team onetwo with Mostert and Cameron Waters in second It was the teams first win at the event since 2006 At the 2015 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 Mostert had a substantial crash in Friday qualifying ruling his car out for the weekend and himself out for the rest of the season This left Winterbottom with a large championship lead entering the final rounds and while he didnt win another race after Sandown Winterbottom held on to win his and the teams first drivers championship The team was leading the teams championship until the final round in which it was overtaken by longtime rivals Triple Eight 

In 2016 Mostert was moved to customer team Rod Nash Racing for sponsorship purposes with Cameron Waters joining the team fulltime in car No 6 alongside defending champion Winterbottom The team only won 2 races both with Winterbottom who finished the championship in 6th place Waters finished his first season in 19th with his best finish being 4th place at the Bathurst 1000 with Jack Le Brocq In 2017 the team continued with the same driver lineup with its only race win being the Sandown 500 with Waters and codriver Richie Stanaway Winterbottom finished the championship in 6th while Waters finished in 8th place

Noyes Minnesota
Noyes is an unincorporated community in St Vincent Township Kittson County Minnesota United States Located in the extreme northwestern corner of the state on the CanadaUnited States border it was an important bordercrossing location going back to the days of ox roads and later was one of the busiest ports of entry west of the Great Lakes for rail and road traffic The town of Emerson Manitoba is directly north of Noyes on the Canadian side of the border

Noyes is the northern terminus of US Highway 75 and the site where the Burlington NorthernSanta Fe and Soo Line Railroads enter Canada Since the construction of Interstate 29 on the North Dakota side of the nearby Red River US Highway 75 has declined in importance The Canadian government closed Emerson port of entry opposite Noyes in 2003 while the Port of Noyes closed in 2006 leaving the US 75 from the south the only access to Noyes Travelers must now use the border crossing located less than two miles to the west but a sevenmile trek from Noyes through Pembina North Dakota to Interstate 29 The rail border crossing remains open but is now managed by the Port of Pembina

A post office called Noyes was established in 1927 and remained in operation until 1990 The community was named for J A Noyes a customs agent

Today Noyes is essentially a quiet community Because of its proximity to the floodprone Red River it is protected by a levee which extends south from Emerson The levee was built in 1989 as part of an International Levee agreement between both countries When flooding cuts off Noyes from the rest of the United States a local state of emergency is declared allowing residents and emergency personnel to move freely across the border within the levee

The 1931 Colonial Revival Noyes Customs and Immigration Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a wellpreserved example of the nations first purposebuilt border checkpoints at land crossings

Matthew Flinders
Captain Matthew Flinders 16 March 1774  19 July 1814 was an English navigator and cartographer who led the second circumnavigation of New Holland that he would subsequently call Australia or Terra Australis and identified it as a continent Abel Tasman had circumnavigated it more widely in 164243 and had charted its north coast in 1644 

Flinders made three voyages to the southern ocean between 1791 and 1810 In the second voyage George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemens Land now Tasmania was an island In the third voyage Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia accompanied by Aboriginal man Bungaree
Heading back to England in 1803 Flinders vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France Mauritius Although Britain and France were at war Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years In captivity he recorded details of his voyages for future publication and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent Australia as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales  a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie

Flinders health had suffered however and although he reached home in 1810 he did not live to see the success of his widely praised book and atlas A Voyage to Terra Australis The location of his grave was lost by the mid19th century but archaeologists excavating a former burial ground near Londons Euston railway station for the High Speed 2 HS2 project announced in January 2019 that his remains had been identified

Matthew Flinders was born in Donington Lincolnshire England the son of Matthew Flinders a surgeon and his wife Susannah ne Ward He was educated at Cowleys Charity School Donington from 1780 and then at the Reverend John Shinglars Grammar School at Horbling in Lincolnshire

In his own words he was induced to go to sea against the wishes of my friends from reading Robinson Crusoe and in 1790 at the age of fifteen he joined the Royal Navy Initially serving on  he transferred to  and in July 1790 was made midshipman on under Captain Pasley By Pasleys recommendation he joined Captain Blighs expedition on  transporting breadfruit from Tahiti to Jamaica This was also Blighs second Breadfruit Voyage following on from the illfated voyage of the Bounty

Flinders first voyage to New South Wales and first trip to Port Jackson was in 1795 as a midshipman aboard  carrying the newly appointed governor of New South Wales Captain John Hunter On this voyage he quickly established himself as a fine navigator and cartographer and became friends with the ships surgeon George Bass who was three years his senior and had been born from Donington

Not long after their arrival in Port Jackson Bass and Flinders made two expeditions in two small open boats named Tom Thumb and Tom Thumb II respectively the first to Botany Bay and Georges River the second in the larger Tom Thumb II south from Port Jackson to Lake Illawarra during which expedition they had to seek shelter at Wattamolla

In 1798 Matthew Flinders now a lieutenant was given command of the sloop with orders to sail beyond Furneauxs Islands and should a strait be found pass through it and return by the south end of Van Diemens Land The passage between the Australian mainland and Tasmania enabled savings of several days on the journey from England and was named Bass Strait after his close friend In honour of this discovery the largest island in Bass Strait would later be named Flinders Island The town of Flinders near the mouth of Western Port also commemorates Bass discovery of that bay and port on 4 January 1798 Flinders never entered Western Port and passed Cape Schanck only on 3 May 1802

Flinders once more sailed Norfolk this time north on 17 July 1799 he arrived in Moreton Bay between modernday Redcliffe and Brighton He touched down at Pumicestone Passage Redcliffe and Coochiemudlo Island and also rowed ashore at Clontarf During this visit he named Redcliffe after the Red Cliffs

In March 1800 Flinders rejoined Reliance and set sail for England

Flinders work had come to the attention of many of the scientists of the day in particular the influential Sir Joseph Banks to whom Flinders dedicated his Observations on the Coasts of Van Diemens Land on Basss Strait etc Banks used his influence with Earl Spencer to convince the Admiralty of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland As a result in January 1801 Flinders was given command of  a 334ton sloop and promoted to commander the following month

Investigator set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801 Attached to the expedition were the botanist Robert Brown botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer landscape artist William Westall gardener Peter Good geological assistant John Allen and John Crosley as astronomer Vallance et al comment that compared to the Baudin expedition this was a modest contingent of scientific gentlemen which reflects British parsimony in scientific endeavour

On 17 April 1801 Flinders married his longtime friend Ann Chappelle 17721852 and had hoped to bring her with him to Port Jackson However the Admiralty had strict rules against wives accompanying captains Flinders brought Ann on board ship and planned to ignore the rules but the Admiralty learned of his plans and he was severely chastised for his bad judgement and told he must remove her from the ship This is well documented in correspondence between Flinders and his chief benefactor Sir Joseph Banks in May 1801

As a result Ann was obliged to stay in England and would not see her husband for nine years following his imprisonment on the Isle de France Mauritius at the time a French possession on his return journey When they finally reunited Matthew and Ann had one daughter Anne 1 April 1812  1892 who later married William Petrie 18211908 In 1853 the governments of New South Wales and Victoria bequeathed a belated pension to her deceased mother of 100 per year to go to surviving issue of the union This she accepted on behalf of her young son William Matthew Flinders Petrie who would go on to become an accomplished archaeologist and Egyptologist

Aboard Investigator Flinders reached and named Cape Leeuwin on 6 December 1801 and proceeded to make a survey along the southern coast of the Australian mainland On his way he stopped in at Oyster Harbour Western Australia There he found a copper plate that Captain Christopher Dixson on  had left the year before It was inscribed Aug 27 1800 Chr Dixson ship Elligood

On 8 April 1802 while sailing east Flinders sighted  a French corvette commanded by the explorer Nicolas Baudin who was on a similar expedition for his government Both men of science Flinders and Baudin met and exchanged details of their discoveries despite believing that their countries were at war Flinders named the bay Encounter Bay

Proceeding along the coast Flinders explored Port Phillip the site of the future city of Melbourne which unknown to him had been discovered only ten weeks earlier by John Murray aboard  Flinders scaled Arthurs Seat the highest point near the shores of the southernmost parts of the bay where the ship had entered through The Heads From there he saw a vast view of the surrounding land and bays Flinders reported back to Governor King that the land had a pleasing and in many parts a fertile appearance After scaling the You Yangs to the northwest on 1 May he stated I left the ships name on a scroll of paper deposited in a small pile of stones upon the top of the peak Here Flinders was drawing upon a British tradition of constructing a stone cairn to mark a historical location 

The Matthew Flinders Cairn which was later enlarged is located on the upper slopes of Arthurs Seat a short distance below Chapmans Point

With stores running low Flinders proceeded to Sydney arriving on 9 May 1802 Here he was rejoined by Bungaree the Aboriginal man who had accompanied him on his earlier coastal survey in 1799

Having hastily prepared the ship Flinders set sail again on 22 July heading north and surveying the coast of Queensland From there he passed through the Torres Strait and explored the Gulf of Carpentaria During this time the ship was discovered to be badly leaking and despite careening they were unable to effect the necessary repairs Reluctantly Flinders returned to Sydney though via the western coast completing the circumnavigation of the continent On the way Flinders jettisoned two wroughtiron anchors which were found by divers in 1973 at Middle Island Recherche Archipelago Western Australia The best bower anchor is on display at the South Australian Maritime Museum while the stream anchor can be seen at the National Museum of Australia

Arriving in Sydney on 9 June 1803 Investigator was subsequently judged to be unseaworthy and condemned

While not formally trained in natural philosophy now termed physics Flinders coined the term dodge tide in reference to his 18023 observations that the tides in the very shallow Spencer and St Vincents Gulfs seemed to be completely inert for several days at select locations Such phenomena have now also been found in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Irish Sea In both the Irish Sea and the two South Australian gulfs a north bound wave from the open ocean interferes nonlinearly and with a reflected and weaker southbound wave resulting in aperiodic and very dissipative tidal motions

In his 1803 observations of the large tides at Broad Sound in Queensland up to 11m range Flinders correctly attributed this to two waves travelling north and south respectively and meeting at Broad Sound He postulated that the dense reef wall further offshore caused the deep ocean tide to bifurcate at the northern southern ends of the reef travel into shallow shelf waters and meet at Broad Sound These phenomena were finally confirmed by G I Taylor in his landmark 1919 Irish Sea analysis

Unable to find another vessel suitable to continue his exploration Flinders set sail for England as a passenger aboard  However the ship was wrecked on Wreck Reefs part of the Great Barrier Reef approximately north of Sydney Flinders navigated the ships cutter across open sea back to Sydney and arranged for the rescue of the remaining marooned crew Flinders then took command of the 29ton schooner in order to return to England but the poor condition of the vessel forced him to put in at Frenchcontrolled Isle de France now known as Mauritius for repairs on 17 December 1803 just three months after Baudin had died there

War with France had broken out again the previous May but Flinders hoped his French passport despite its being issued for Investigator and not Cumberland and the scientific nature of his mission would allow him to continue on his way Despite this and the knowledge of Baudins earlier encounter with Flinders the French governor Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen detained Flinders The relationship between the men soured Flinders was affronted at his treatment and Decaen insulted by Flinders refusal of an invitation to dine with him and his wife Decaen was suspicious of the alleged scientific mission as the Cumberland carried no scientists and Decaens search of Flinders vessel uncovered a trunk full of papers including despatches from the New South Wales Governor Philip Gidley King that were not permitted under his scientific passport Furthermore one of Kings despatches was specifically to the British Admiralty requesting more troops in case Decaen were to attack Port Jackson Among the papers seized were the three logs of of which only Volume one and Volume two were returned to Flinders these are now both held by the State Library of New South Wales The third volume was later deposited in the Admiralty Library and is now held in the British Public Record Office Decaen referred the matter to the French government this was delayed not only by the long voyage but also by the general confusion of war Eventually on 11 March 1806 Napoleon gave his approval but Decaen still refused to allow Flinders release By this stage Decaen believed Flinders knowledge of the islands defences would have encouraged Britain to attempt to capture it Nevertheless in June 1809 the Royal Navy began a blockade of the island and in June 1810 Flinders was paroled Travelling via the Cape of Good Hope on  which was taking despatches back to Britain he received a promotion to postcaptain before continuing to England

Flinders had been confined for the first few months of his captivity but he was later afforded greater freedom to move around the island and access his papers In November 1804 he sent the first map of the landmass he had charted Y461 back to England This was the only map made by Flinders where he used the name Australia or Terra Australis for the title instead of New Holland the name of the continent that James Cook had used in 1770 and Abel Tasman had coined a Dutch version of in 1644 and the first known time he used the word Australia He used the name New Holland on his map only for the western part of the continent Due to the delay caused by his lengthy confinement the first published map of the Australian continent was the Freycinet Map of 1811 a product of the Baudin expedition issued in 1811

Flinders finally returned to England in October 1810 He was in poor health but immediately resumed work preparing A Voyage to Terra Australis and his atlas of maps for publication The full title of this book which was first published in London in July 1814 was given as was common at the time a synoptic description A Voyage to Terra Australis undertaken for the purpose of completing the discovery of that vast country and prosecuted in the years 1801 1802 and 1803 in His Majestys ship the Investigator and subsequently in the armed vessel Porpoise and Cumberland Schooner With an account of the shipwreck of the Porpoise arrival of the Cumberland at Mauritius and imprisonment of the commander during six years and a half in that island  Original copies of the Atlas to Flinders Voyage to Terra Australis are held at the Mitchell Library in Sydney as a portfolio that accompanied the book and included engravings of 16 maps four plates of views and ten plates of Australian flora The book was republished in three volumes in 1964 accompanied by a reproduction of the portfolio Flinders map of Terra Australis or Australia so the two parts of the double name of his 1804 manuscript reversed was first published in January 1814 and the remaining maps were published before his atlas and book

Flinders died aged 40 on 19 July 1814 the day after the book and atlas was published On 23 July he was interred in the burial ground of St Jamess Church Piccadilly which was located some distance from the church beside Hampstead Road Camden London The burial ground was in use from 1790 until 1853 By 1852 the location of the grave had been forgotten due to alterations to the burial ground

In 1878 the cemetery became St Jamess Gardens Camden with only a few gravestones lining the edges of the park Part of the gardens located between Hampstead Road and Euston railway station was built over when Euston station was expanded and Flinders grave was thought to possibly lie under a station platform The Gardens were closed to the public in 2017 for work on the High Speed 2 HS2 rail project which requires the expansion of Euston station

The grave was located in January 2019 by archaeologists His coffin was identified by its wellpreserved lead coffin plate It is proposed to rebury his remains at a site to be decided after they have been examined by osteoarchaeologists

Flinders map Y461 was never lost It had been stored and recorded by the UK Hydrographic Office before 1828 Geoffrey C Ingleton mentioned Y461 in his book Matthew Flinders Navigator and Chartmaker on page 438 By 1987 every library in Australia had access to a microfiche copy of Flinders Y461 In 20012002 the Mitchell Library Sydney displayed Y461 at their Matthew Flinders  The Ultimate Voyage exhibition Paul Brunton called Y461 the memorial of the great naval explorer Matthew Flinders The first hardcopy of Y461 and its cartouche was retrieved from the UK Hydrographic Office Taunton Somerset by historian Bill Fairbanks in 2004 On 2 April 2004 copies of the chart were presented by three of Matthew Flinderss descendants to the Governor of New South Wales in London to be presented in turn to the people of Australia through their parliaments by 14 November the 200th anniversary of the chart leaving Mauritius This celebration marked the first time the naming of Australia was formally recognised

Flinders was not the first to use the word Australia nor was he the first to apply the name specifically to the continent He owned a copy of Alexander Dalrymples 1771 book An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean and it seems likely he borrowed it from there but he applied it specifically to the continent not the whole South Pacific region In 1804 he wrote to his brother I call the whole island Australia or Terra Australis and later that year he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks and mentioned my general chart of Australia A map Flinders constructed from all the information he had accumulated while he was in Australian waters and finished while he was detained by the French in Mauritius Flinders explained in his letter to Banks

Flinders continued to promote the use of the word until his arrival in London in 1810 Here he found that Banks did not approve of the name and had not unpacked the chart he had sent him and that New Holland and Terra Australis were still in general use As a result a book by Flinders was published under the title A Voyage to Terra Australis and his published map of 1814 also shows Terra Australis as the first of the two name options despite his objections The final proofs were brought to him on his deathbed but he was unconscious The book was published on 18 July 1814 but Flinders did not regain consciousness and died the next day never knowing that his name for the continent would be accepted

Banks wrote in a draft introduction to Flinders Voyage referring to the map published by Melchisdech Thvenot in Relations des Divers Voyages 1663 and made wellknown to English readers by Emanuel Bowens adaptation of it A Complete Map of the Southern Continent published in John Campbells editions of John Harriss Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca or Voyages and Travels 174448 and 1764

Although Thvenot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall in fact it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of Joan Blaeu in his Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus published in 1659 It appears to have been Thvenot who introduced a differentiation between Nova Hollandia to the west and Terre Australe to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135 East of Greenwich emphasised by the latitude staff running down that meridian as there is no such division on Blaeus map

In his book Flinders wrote

with the accompanying note at the bottom of the page

So Flinders had concluded that the Terra Australis as hypothesised by Aristotle and Ptolemy which would later be discovered as Antarctica did not exist therefore he wanted the name applied to the continent of Australia and it stuck

Flinders book was widely read and gave the term Australia general currency Lachlan Macquarie Governor of New South Wales became aware of Flinders preference for the name Australia and used it in his dispatches to England On 12 December 1817 he recommended to the Colonial Office that it be officially adopted In 1824 the British Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially as Australia

Although he never used his own name for any feature in all his discoveries Flinders name is now associated with over 100 geographical features and places in Australia including Flinders Island in Bass Strait but not Flinders Island in South Australia which he named for his younger brother Samuel Flinders

Flinders is seen as being particularly important in South Australia where he is considered the main explorer of the state Landmarks named after him in South Australia include the Flinders Ranges and Flinders Ranges National Park Flinders Column at Mount Lofty Flinders Chase National Park on Kangaroo Island Flinders University Flinders Medical Centre the suburb Flinders Park and Flinders Street in Adelaide In Victoria eponymous places include Flinders Peak Flinders Street in Melbourne the suburb of Flinders the federal electorate of Flinders and the Matthew Flinders Girls Secondary College in Geelong

Flinders Bay in Western Australia and Flinders Way in Canberra also commemorate him Educational institutions named after him include Flinders Park Primary School on South Australia and Matthew Flinders Anglican College on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland A former electoral district of the Queensland Parliament was named Flinders There are also Flinders Highways in both Queensland and South Australia
Bass  Flinders Point in the southernmost part of Cronulla in New South Wales features a monument to George Bass and Matthew Flinders who explored the Port Hacking estuary

Australia holds a large collection of statues erected in Flinders honour In his native England the first statue of Flinders was erected on 16 March 2006 his birthday in his hometown of Donington The statue also depicts his beloved cat Trim who accompanied him on his voyages In July 2014 on the 200year anniversary of his death a large bronze statue of Flinders by the sculptor Mark Richards was unveiled at Australia House London by Prince William Duke of Cambridge and later installed at Euston station near the presumed location of his grave

Flinders proposal for the use of iron bars to be used to compensate for the magnetic deviations caused by iron on board a ship resulted in their being known as Flinders bars

Flinders who was Sir John Franklins cousin by marriage Johns mother Hannah being the sister of Matthews step mother Elizabeth instilled in him a love for navigating and took him with him on his voyage aboard Investigator

In 1964 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by PostmasterGenerals Department again in 1980 and in 1998 with George Bass

Flindersia is a genus of 14 species of tree in the citrus family Named by Investigators botanist Robert Brown in honour of Matthew Flinders

Flinders landed on Coochiemudlo Island on 19 July 1799 while he was searching for a river in the southern part of Moreton Bay Queensland Australia
The islands residents celebrate Flinders Day annually commemorating the landing The celebrations are usually held on a weekend near 19 July the actual date of the landing

Star Wars Arcade
Star Wars Arcade also known as Star Wars is a video game developed by Sega and released in 1993 to arcades A home port served as a launch title for the Sega 32X in 1994 It is set during the original Star Wars trilogy

Gameplay is similar to that of Ataris 1983 Star Wars arcade game Players pilot an Xwing or a Ywing in first or third person perspective and battle Imperial forces

The game has three levels which include intercepting TIE fighters in an asteroid field destroying a Super Star Destroyer and making an assault run on a Death Star The arcade cabinet allows two people to play with one serving as pilot and the other as gunner

Sega followed this with the release of Star Wars Trilogy Arcade in 1998

Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the 32X version at 62510 describing it as a decent but disappointing launch title for the console They cited excellent graphics but repetitive gameplay and complained about the limited movement GamePro similarly assessed that the game is a decent demonstration of the 32Xs graphical capabilities but suffers from repetitive gameplay They also criticized that the controls are convoluted when using a standard threebutton gamepad and that in cooperative mode the second players cursor is difficult to see against certain backgrounds Next Generation rated the 32X version of the game at three stars out of five calling it An excellent translation of a good game and a good hint of what to expect from 32X

P16
p16 also known as p16 cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 2A multiple tumor suppressor 1 and as several other synonyms is a tumor suppressor protein that in humans is encoded by the CDKN2A gene p16 plays an important role in cell cycle regulation by decelerating the cells progression from G1 phase to S phase and therefore acts as a tumor suppressor that is implicated in the prevention of cancers notably melanoma oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cervical cancer and esophageal cancer p16 can be used as a biomarker to improve the histological diagnostic accuracy of CIN3 Expression of the CDKN2A gene is frequently changed in a wide variety of tumors

p16 was originally found in an open reading frame of 148 amino acids encoding a protein with a molecular weight of 16 kDa that comprises four ankyrin repeats The name of p16 is derived from its molecular weight while the alternative name p16 additionally refers to its role in inhibiting CDK4

p16 is also known as

In humans p16 is encoded by the CDKN2A gene located on chromosome 9 9p213 This gene generates several transcript variants that differ in their first exons At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 The remaining transcript includes an alternate exon 1 located 20 kb upstream of the remainder of the gene this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame ARF that specifies a protein that is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants The ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with and sequester MDM2 a protein responsible for the degradation of p53 In spite of their structural and functional differences the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression share a common functionality in controlling the G1 phase of the cell cycle This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene

When organisms age the expression of p16 increases to reduce the proliferation of stem cells This reduction in the division and production of stem cells protects against cancer while increasing the risks associated with cellular senescence

p16 is an inhibitor of cyclindependent kinases CDK It slows down the cell cycle by prohibiting progression from G1 phase to S phase Otherwise CDK46 binds cyclin D and forms an active protein complex that phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein pRB Once phosphorylated pRB dissociates from the transcription factor E2F1 This liberates E2F1 from its bound state in the cytoplasm and allows it to enter the nucleus Once in the nucleus E2F1 promotes the transcription of target genes that are essential for transition from G1 to S phase

This pathway connects the processes of tumor oncogenesis and senescence fixing them on opposite ends of a spectrum On one end the hypermethylation mutation or deletion of p16 leads to downregulation of the gene and can lead to cancer through the dysregulation of cell cycle progression Conversely activation of p16 through reactive oxygen species DNA damage or senescence leads to the buildup of p16 in tissues and is implicated in the aging of cells

Regulation of p16 is complex and involves the interaction of several transcription factors as well as several proteins involved in epigenetic modification through methylation and repression of the promoter region

PRC1 and PRC2 are two protein complexes that modify the expression of p16 through the interaction of various transcription factors that execute methylation patterns that can repress transcription of p16 These pathways are activated in the cellular response to reduce senescence

Mutations resulting in deletion or reduction of function of the CDKN2A gene are associated with increased risk of a wide range of cancers and alterations of the gene are frequently seen in cancer cell lines Examples include

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is often associated with mutations in the CDKN2A gene

Carriers of germline mutations in CDKN2A have besides their high risks of melanoma also increased risks of pancreatic lung laryngeal and oropharyngeal cancers Tobacco smoking increases the carriers susceptibility for such nonmelanoma cancers

Homozygous deletions of p16 are frequently found in esophageal cancer and gastric cancer cell lines

Germline mutations in CDKN2A are associated with an increased susceptibility to develop skin cancer

Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in various cancers In 2013 a metaanalysis revealed an increased frequency of DNA methylation of the p16 gene in esophageal cancer As the degree of tumor differentiation increased so did the frequency of p16 DNA methylation

Tissue samples of primary oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC often display hypermethylation in the promoter regions of p16 Cancer cells show a significant increase in the accumulation of methylation in CpG islands in the promoter region of p16 This epigenetic change leads to loss of the tumor suppressor gene function through two possible mechanisms first methylation can physically inhibit the transcription of the gene and second methylation can lead to the recruitment of transcription factors that repress transcription Both mechanisms cause the same end result downregulation of gene expression that leads to decreased levels of the p16 protein It has been suggested that this process is responsible for the development of various forms of cancer serving as an alternative process to gene deletion or mutation

p16 positivity has been shown to be favorably prognostic in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma In a retrospective trial analysis of patients with Stage III and IV oropharyngeal cancer HPV status was assessed and it was found that the 3year rates of overall survival were 824 95 CI 772 to 876 in the HPVpositive subgroup and 571 95 CI 481 to 661 in the HPVnegative subgroup and the 3year rates of progressionfree survival were 737 95 CI 677 to 798 and 434 95 CI 344 to 524 respectively p16 status is so prognostic that the AJCC staging system has been revised to include p16 status in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer group staging

Expression of p16 is used as a prognostic biomarker for certain types of cancer The reason for this is different types of cancer can have different effects on p16 expression cancers that overexpress p16 are usually caused by the human papillomavirus HPV whereas cancers in which p16 is downregulated will usually have other causes For patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma using immunohistochemistry to detect the presence of the p16 biomarker has been shown to be the strongest indicator of disease course Presence of the biomarker is associated with a more favorable prognosis as measured by cancerspecific survival CSS recurrencefree survival RFS locoregional control LRC as well as other measurements The appearance of hypermethylation of p16 is also being evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer

p16 deletion detected by FISH in surface epithelial mesothelial proliferations is predictive of underlying invasive mesothelioma

As consensus grows regarding the strength of p16 as a biomarker for detecting and determining prognoses of cancer p16 immunohistochemistry is growing in importance

p16 is a widely used immunohistochemical marker in gynecologic pathology Strong and diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of p16 in squamous cell carcinomas SCC of the female genital tract is strongly associated with highrisk human papilloma virus HPV infection and neoplasms of cervical origin The majority of SCCs of uterine cervix express p16 However p16 can be expressed in other neoplasms and in several normal human tissues

More than a third of urinary bladder SCCs express p16 SCCs of urinary bladder express p16 independent of gender p16 immunohistochemical expression alone cannot be used to discriminate between SCCs arising from uterine cervix versus urinary bladder

Concentrations of p16INK4a increase dramatically as tissue ages p16INK4a along with senescenceassociated betagalactosidase is regarded to be a biomarker of cellular senescence Therefore p16INK4a could potentially be used as a blood test that measures how fast the bodys tissues are aging at a molecular level Notably a recent survey of cellular senescence induced by multiple treatments to several cell lines does not identify p16 as belonging to a core signature of senescence markers

It has been used as a target to delay some aging changes in mice

p16INK4a has been shown to prevent the depletion during aging of neural stem and progenitor cells in one of the neurogenic niche of the adult brain ie the subventricular zone which generates throughout life new neurons migrating to the olfactory bulb  Deletion of p16INK4a does not affect neurogenesis in the other adult neurogenic niche the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus  However recently it has been demonstrated that p16INK4a protects from depletion after a powerful proneurogenic stimulus  ie running  also stem and progenitor cells of the aged dentate gyrus  In fact after deletion of p16INK4a stem cells of the dentate gyrus are greatly activated by running while in wildtype p16INK4a dentate gyrus stem cells are not affected by running Therefore p16Ink4a plays a role in the maintenance of dentate gyrus stem cells after stimulus by keeping a reserve of their selfrenewal capacity during aging Since the dentate gyrus plays a key role in spatial and contextual memory formation p16INK4a is implicated in the maintenance of cognitive functions during aging

Researchers Manuel Serrano Gregory J Hannon and David Beach discovered p16 in 1993 and correctly characterized the protein as a cyclindependent kinase inhibitor Since its discovery p16 has become significant in the field of cancer research The protein was suspected to be involved in carcinogenesis due to the observation that mutation or deletion in the gene was implicated in human cancer cell lines The detection of p16 inactivation in familial melanoma supplied further evidence p16 deletion mutation hypermethylation or overexpression is now associated with various cancers Whether mutations in p16 can be considered to be driver mutations requires further investigation

p16 has been shown to interact with

McNulty
McNulty also spelled MacNulty McAnulty McEnulty and Nulty amongst other variationsis an Irish surname meaning son of the Ulsterman Usually considered a branch of the Ulaid ruling dynasty of Mac Duinnshlibhe MacDonlevy who fled Ulaid to Ailech after the formers conquest in 1177 by the Normans DNA analysis points to descent from other Ulaid families as well After the Battle of Kinsale in 1602 some McDonlevys and McNultys migrated to the province of Connacht where their name is now common

The name is said to have arisen from a branch of the ruling Ulaid dynasty of Mac Duinnshlibhe MacDonlevy who had migrated to what is now County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland after John de Courcys conquest of Ulaid in 1177 Here some of the MacDonlevys were nicknamed UltaghUltach However historical records such as the 1659 Census as well as Griffiths Valuation 18481864 show that concentrations of McNultys were found in parts of Ireland where the MacDonlevys had little presence coupled with DNA analysis showing that the McNultys may actually derive from other Gaelic families that migrated from Ulaid and not just the MacDonlevys The names UltaghUltach and Mac an Ultaigh applied to only those that fled Ulaid and was not used for those that remained

Regardless of their actual origin the first McNulty to be recorded is found in the Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1281 where an Murtough MacanUlty is listed as a distinguished fatality at the battle of Desertcreagh in presentday County Tyrone Northern Ireland

The probable transition of the name Mac an Ultaigh from the Ultagh MacDonlevys can be seen around 1601 where one Morris Ultagh is recorded as Morris mNich Ultagh The surname prefix mNich appears to be an English confusion of the female prefix Nic with the male prefix Mac

Other variant spellings of McNulty include McNaulty McNalty and rarely as ONalty Nolty McNult McEnulty and McKnulty and others

In County Clare and its adjacent County Tipperary in the southwest of the Republic of Ireland the toponymics Connoulty and Kinoulty are encountered and are believed to be Anglicisations of Mac an Ultaigh

By 1980 there were 19469 persons surnamed McNulty in the United States Social Security Administration data base The surname McNulty was then the 2332 most frequently occurring surname in that database Some of the first McNulty immigrants to North America arrived in Philadelphia and New York City in the very early 19th century and later more numerously in both Philadelphia and New York City between 1840 and 1860 during which period the great Irish Potato Famine occurred

There are an estimated 421 persons surnamed McNulty in Australia Denis McInulty one of the first McNulty to arrive in Australia arrived there from Scotland on 16 May 1846 on the prisoner transport the China under a 10year sentence of the Glasgow Justiciary Court

Xiao Cha
Emperor Xuan of Western Liang  519562 personal name Xiao Cha  courtesy name Lisun  was the founding emperor of the Chinese Western Liang dynasty He took the Liang throne under support from Western Wei after Western Wei forces had defeated and killed his uncle Emperor Yuan in 554 but many traditional historians because he controlled little territory and relied heavily on military support by Western Wei and Western Weis successor state Northern Zhou did not consider him and his successors true emperors of Liang Instead their state is traditionally considered separate as Western Liang or Later Liang

Xiao Cha was born in 519 as the third son of Xiao Tong then the crown prince to Liang Dynastys founder Emperor Wu His mother was Xiao Tongs concubine Consort Gong He was considered studious concentrating particularly on Buddhist sutras and as Emperor Wu was a devout Buddhist he was happy that his grandson studied sutras in this manner When Emperor Wu created Xiao Tongs sons dukes sometime between 520 and 527 Xiao Cha was created the Duke of Qujiang

In 531 Xiao Tong died but instead of creating Xiao Tongs oldest son Xiao Huan  the Duke of Huarong crown prince to succeed him as was expected under Confucian principles of succession Emperor Wu created Xiao Tongs younger brother Xiao Gang crown prince instead However he felt that he did not treat Xiao Tongs sons fairly and therefore he created them princesin Xiao Chas case the Prince of Yueyangand gave them honors only slightly subordinate to their uncles Because the capital commandery of Eastern Yang Province  modern central and eastern Zhejiang Kuaiji Commandery the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay was the richest commandery of the entire empire he rotated them as the governor of Eastern Yang Province and Xiao Cha was thus rotated there sometime before 546 However despite these special treatments Xiao Cha was still angry that he and his brothers were passed over by Emperor Wu He saw that Emperor Wu late in his long reign since 502 was ruling over an imperial regime that was becoming inefficient and beset by factionalism between Emperor Wus sons and therefore when he was made the governor of Yong Province  modern northwestern Hubei in 546 he thought that this would be a good chance for him to establish a power base of his own and therefore he cultivated the loyalty of the people to him by governing carefully

In 548 the general Hou Jing rebelled and attacked the capital Jiankang capturing it in 549 and taking Emperor Wu and Crown Prince Gang hostage Emperor Wu died later that year and was succeeded by Crown Prince Gang as Emperor Jianwen albeit under Hous control Meanwhile also in 548 Emperor Wu had made Xiao Chas older brother Xiao Yu  the Prince of Hedong the governor of Xiang Province  modern central Hunan rotating the previous governor of Xiang Province Zhang Zuan  to Yong Province Zhang was a close friend of Emperor Wus powerful son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong who was then the governor of the key Jing Province  modern western and central Hubei and he did not take Xiao Yu seriously making Xiao Yu felt disrespected Xiao Yu therefore detained Zhang and did not permit him to leave Further when Xiao Yi called for the provincial governors in his command region which inter alia included both Xiang and Yong Provinces to send troops to help lift the siege on Jiankang Xiao Yu refused and while Xiao Cha sent a detachment he refused to command the detachment personally When Zhang fled from Xiao Yus custody late in 548 then he went to Xiao Yi and bearing grudges against Xiao Yu falsely accused Xiao Yu Xiao Cha and their cousin Xiao Cao  the Prince of Guiyang and governor of Xin Province  modern eastern Chongqing of conspiring against Xiao Yi Xiao Yi therefore killed Xiao Cao and prepared an army to attack Xiao Yu

Xiao Yu was initially able to repel Xiao Yis attack and cause Xiao Yis heir apparent Xiao Fangdeng  to die in battle in summer 549 but by fall 549 he had been defeated by Xiao Yis general Bao Quan  who put Xiao Yus headquarters at Changsha  in modern Changsha Hunan under siege Xiao Yu requested aid from Xiao Cha and Xiao Cha commanded an army to attack Xiao Yis headquarters at Jiangling He put Jiangling under siege but his attack was affected by heavy rains and repelled by Xiao Yis general Wang Sengbian and when his own general Du Ze  surrendered to Xiao Yi and Du Zes brother Du An  further launched a surprise attack on Xiao Chas headquarters at Xiangyang  in modern Xiangfan Hubei Xiao Cha was forced to withdraw back to Xiangyang Unable to help his brother and fearing that he would become Xiao Yis next targetindeed Xiao Yi then sent the general Liu Zhongli  to attack Xiao ChaXiao Cha submitted to Western Wei offering to become a vassal and sought aid sending his wife Princess Wang and his heir apparent Xiao Liao  to Western Wei as hostages Yuwen Tai the paramount general of Western Wei accepted Xiao Chas submission and sent the general Yang Zhong  to aid Xiao Cha and Yang defeated and captured Liu in spring 550 Yang subsequently entered into a treaty with Xiao Yi putting Xiao Cha under Western Weis protection Xiao Yi sacked Changsha and executed Xiao Yu in 550

In the summer of 550 Western Wei offered to declare Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang to inherit Emperor Wus throne Xiao Cha declined but accepted the lesser title of Prince of Liang and also assumed acting imperial authority Later that year made a trip to the Western Wei capital Changan to pay homage to Emperor Wen of Western Wei and Yuwen In spring 551 when his uncle Xiao Guan  the Prince of Shaoling was captured and killed by Western Wei troops commanded by Yang Xiao Cha who respected Xiao Guan took his body and buried it with honors In summer 551 when he heard that Hou was launching an attack on Xiao Yis domain he sent his general Cai Dabao  with an army heading toward Jiangling claiming to be ready to render assistance but after Xiao Yi sent a rebuking letter he ordered Cai to withdraw

In 552 after defeating Hou Xiao Yi declared himself emperor as Emperor Yuan and set his capital at Jiangling Believing himself to be strong he was arrogant in his dealings with Western Wei drawing attention from Yuwen who began to consider invading Liang When Xiao Cha became aware of this he paid additional tribute to Western Wei to try to fan the flame Subsequently in spring 553 when Emperor Yuan not only made the Western Wei envoy Yuwen Renshu  felt insulted by not treating him with as much respect as the envoy from Northern Qi but further made demands to Yuwen Tai to return former Liang territory taken by Western Wei Yuwen Tai decided to invade the Liang In winter 553 Northern Zhou troops commanded by Yu Jin  arrived at Xiangyang and Xiao Chas forces joined them and continued to advance south toward Jiangling Emperor Yuan was caught unprepared and while he summoned his generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin to come to his aid Emperor Yuan surrendered before they could arrive Xiao Cha took the custody of Emperor Yuan interrogating and insulting him heavily Around the new year 555 with approval from Western Wei authorities Xiao Cha put Emperor Yuan to death by suffocating him with a large bag full of dirt He also executed Emperor Yuans sons who were captured when Jiangling fell

Western Wei created Xiao Cha Emperor of Western Liang and he declared himself as such in spring 555 as Emperor Xuan Western Wei forces transferred Jiangling and the surrounding area to Emperor Xuan but required him to transfer control of the Xiangyang region in exchange and further left a military garrison at Jiangling both to protect Emperor Xuan and to make sure that he would not rebel Further Western Wei troops pillaged Jiangling and took most of the inhabitants and the Liang imperial treasures back to Changan While Western Wei troops under Yu were still at Jiangling Emperor Xuans subordinate Yin Deyi  suggested that he make a surprise attack on Yu and slaughter the Western Wei troops then reassert Liangs independence Emperor Xuan declined reasoning that Western Wei had protected him greatly and that to turn against Western Wei would be unjust He later regretted the decision but the decision was probably a correct one as the other Liang generals showed no inclination of recognizing him as emperor As whether Emperor Xuan was a legitimate emperor of Liang was thereafter historically debated his state is usually referred to by historians as either Western Liang or Later Liang

Emperor Xuan posthumously honored his father Xiao Tong and Xiao Tongs wife Crown Princess Cai as emperor and empress and honored his mother Consort Gong as empress dowager He created his wife Princess Wang empress and as his heir apparent Xiao Liao had died by this point he created Xiao Liaos younger brother Xiao Kui as crown prince He entrusted much of the governmental matters to Cai Dabao and Wang Cao  both of whom served him faithfully He appeared to have full expectation that he would be able to put additional Liang provinces under his control but immediately the Liang generals including Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin refused to recognize him Wang Lin who controlled modern Hunan and later parts of modern Hubei indeed sent his general Hou Ping  to attack Emperor Xuan and while the attack was unsuccessful Emperor Xuan was unable to expand his holdings

Later in 555 Wang Sengbian declared Emperor Yuans cousin Xiao Yuanming emperor In fall 555 after Wang Sengbian was killed by his lieutenant Chen Baxian Chen deposed Xiao Yuanming and declared Emperor Yuans son Xiao Fangzhi emperor as Emperor Jing After Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him in 558 establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu Wang Lin declared Emperor Yuans grandson Xiao Zhuang emperor thus maintaining a competing claim for the Liang throne

In late 558 with Wang Lin having advanced east to try to attack Chen Emperor Xuan sent Wang Cao to try to seize the commanderies forming modern Hunan from Xiao Zhuangs domain although the scope of success for this action was unclear In any case however when Hou Tian  a general of Chen Baxians nephew Emperor Wen of Chen defeated Wang Lin in spring 560 a combination of Emperor Xuans and Northern Zhou troops were able to take the western half of Xiao Zhuangs territory and Emperor Xuan assumed control over that territory albeit requiring Northern Zhou military support

In fall 560 Hou Tian continued his advance intending to take Xiang Province from Emperor Wenxuan Northern Zhou generals Heruo Dun  and Dugu Sheng  led their troops against Hou and Chen and Northern Zhou troops soon stalemated and while initially Hou was unable to make much progress against Heruo and Dugu soon problems with food supplies and illnesses caused Northern Zhou troops to be worn down Around the new year 561 Dugu was forced to withdraw putting Heruo under even greater pressure By spring 561 Yin Liang  who was defending Changsha surrendered to Chen Hou Tian then proposed to Heruo to let him withdraw peacefully Heruo agreed and withdrew and all of the territory previously taken from Xiao Zhuang were now in Chen hands limiting Emperor Xuans domain to the Jiangling region again

Emperor Xuan depressed that his territory was small and heavily damaged by warfare soon began to suffer from a serious skin lesion on his back He died in spring 562 Xiao Kui succeeded him as Emperor Ming

The historian Li Yanshou  in his History of Northern Dynasties had this to say about Emperor Xuan both praising him and noting some of his idiosyncricies

Emperor Xuan was literarily capable and he wrote 15 volumes of literary works and 36 volumes of commentary on Buddhist sutras

AllNBL Team
The AllNBL Team is an annual National Basketball League NBL honour bestowed on the best players in the league following every NBL season The team has been selected in every season since the leagues second year in 1980

The AllNBL Team is chosen via a voting system involving the head coach one assistant coach and the team captain of each team Voters select their AllNBL First and Second Teams by selecting three outside players and two inside players for each team Players are then allocated 3 points for being placed into a First Team and 2 points for being placed into a Second Team These points are then combined with the Top10 players making up the First and Second Teams allowing for an even spread of three outside players and two inside players on each team

On a few occasions the leagues Most Valuable Player MVP has not been named in the AllNBL First Team for that year This anomaly is a result of the difference between the voting systems determining the two awards in the past

Since the 201314 season the AllNBL Team has been composed of two teams each with five roster spots Players are selected with regard to position allowing for an even spread of three outside players and two inside players on each team

Xiao Yuanming
Xiao Yuanming  died 556 courtesy name Jingtong  often known by his preascension title of Marquess of Zhenyang  at times known by his postremoval title Duke of Jianan  honored Emperor Min  by Xiao Zhuang was briefly an emperor of the Chinese Liang Dynasty He was the nephew of the founding emperor Emperor Wu In 555 with Liang in disarray after Western Wei had captured and killed Emperor Yuan Northern Qi which had held Xiao Yuanming as an honored captive since 547 forced the general Wang Sengbian to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor Soon however Wangs subordinate Chen Baxian killed Wang and removed Xiao Yuanming from the throne replacing him with Emperor Yuans son Xiao Fangzhi Emperor Jing Xiao Yuanming died the following year

It is not known when Xiao Yuanming was born His father Xiao Yi  was a major general during late Southern Qi and of Xiao Yis sons five perhaps all are known to history Xiao Yuanming was the youngest among these sons As Xiao Yi was forced to commit suicide by Southern Qis cruel emperor Xiao Baojuan in 500 Xiao Yuanming could not have been born any later than 501

After Xiao Yis death Xiao Yis younger brother and Xiao Yuanmings uncle Xiao Yan rebelled at his post of Xiangyang seeking to avenge Xiao Yi By 502 he put the capital Jiankang under siege and Xiao Baojuan was killed by his own generals Later that year Xiao Yan seized the throne from Xiao Baojuans younger brother Emperor He of Southern Qi ending Southern Qi and establishing Liang Dynasty as Emperor Wu Emperor Wu was said to love Xiao Yuanming greatly and he created Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang

Nothing is known about Xiao Yuanmings career as an official until 547 when it was recorded that he was the governor of Yu Province  modern central Anhui The people were said to be so impressed by his governance that they made a stone monument commemorating his term of office However it became known later that the artisans who carved the monument were associated with and paid by Xiao Yuanming Therefore it became widely believed that he had encouraged the people to create the monument to praise himself

In 547 the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing in conflict with the regent Gao Cheng surrendered his domain13 provinces between the Yellow River and the Huai Riverto Liang Emperor Wu accepted Hous surrender and commissioned an army to aid Hou to be commanded by Emperor Wus grandson Xiao Huili  the Prince of Nankang Xiao Yuanming requested to accompany Xiao Huili and was made Xiao Huilis assistant However Xiao Huili was cowardly and arrogant and he refused to meet his subordinate generals even Xiao Yuanming Xiao Yuanming secretly informed Emperor Wu of this and Emperor Wu relieved Xiao Huili of his command and put Xiao Yuanming in command

The Liang army commanded by Xiao Yuanming advanced on the Eastern Wei city Pengcheng  in modern Xuzhou Jiangsu and Xiao Yuanming camped at Hanshan  in Pengchengs vicinity and built a dam over Si River  to use water to attack Pengcheng Xiao Yuanmings lieutenant the general Yang Kan  quickly completed the dam but when Yang advised Xiao Yuanming to attack Pengcheng Xiao Yuanming hesitated Because Xiao Yuanming could not come up with a coordinated strategy the generals under him began to carry out their own actions including pillaging the people in the region and Xiao Yuanming was unable to stop them save the units directly under his own command

Late in 547 the Eastern Wei forces commanded by Murong Shaozong  arrived and instead of engaging the Eastern Wei forces quickly as Yang suggested Xiao Yuanming became drunk with wine and allowed Murongs army to settle in When the armies did engage the Liang forces were initially successful but Murongs counterattack caused Liang forces to collapse and Xiao Yuanming was captured However the people of the region was impressed by his refusal to pillage them and gave him the epithet the righteous prince  yi wang He was taken to the Eastern Wei capital Yecheng  in modern Handan Hebei where Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei formally received and rebuked him and then released him sending him to Gao Chengs headquarters at Jinyang  in modern Taiyuan Shanxi where Gao treated him with honorintending to use Xiao Yuanming as a pawn in negotiations with Liang Subsequently Gao allowed Xiao Yuanming to write to Emperor Wu and offered to return Xiao Yuanmingcausing Hou who had by that point lost the 13 provinces but controlled Yu Province to rebel in 548 capturing Jiankang in 549 taking Emperor Wu and his crown prince Xiao Gang hostages and throwing Liang into a general state of confusion and unrest

Little is known about Xiao Yuanmings activities while in Eastern Wei and its successor state Northern Qi as Gao Chengs successor and brother Gao Yang seized the throne from Emperor Xiaojing in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan although it was said that Xiao Yuanming cried bitterly when he heard about the fall of Jiankang He was given the office of sanqi changshi   an honorific office with little responsibilities

In 552 Emperor Wus son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong defeated Hou and declared himself emperor as Emperor Yuan setting his capital at Jiangling  in modern Jingzhou Hubei rather than the wardevastated Jiankang but in 554 Western Wei forces captured Jiangling capturing and then executing Emperor Yuan In light of Emperor Yuans death his most important general Wang Sengbian and Wangs lieutenant Chen Baxian who together controlled the eastern empire welcomed Emperor Yuans 12yearold son Xiao Fangzhi to Jiankang preparing to make him emperor and in spring 555 Xiao Fangzhi took the title Prince of Liang

At that time however Emperor Wenxuan who had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to establish Xiao Yuanmings cousin Xiao Tui  as Liangs emperor in 553 decided to again try to establish a vassal regime in Liang He wrote Wang suggesting that Xiao Fangzhi was too young to be emperor and proposing Xiao Yuanming as emperorand Xiao Yuanming apparently cooperated with Emperor Wenxuan in this attempt as he wrote a letter to Wang as well Wang initially wrote back to reject the offer However a few quick victories by Northern Qi escort forces commanded by Emperor Wenxuans brother Gao Huan  the Prince of Shangdang made Wang fearful and he wrote back agreeing to support Xiao Yuanming as emperorbut extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to create Xiao Fangzhi crown prince Wang also allowedly only 1000 soldiers to accompany Xiao Yuanming south of the Yangtze River In summer 555 Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang and as he saw the main gate to the palaceZhuque Gate  he cried bitterly and the Liang officials also cried bitterly He then took the throne Pursuant to his promise he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince Wang and Chen continued to be in command of the armed forces

Xiao Yuanmings reign did not last long In fall 555 Chen Baxian displeased with Xiao Yuanmings ascensionwhich he had tried to persuade Wang Sengbian not to acceptmade a surprise attack on Jiankang from his post at Jingkou  in modern Zhenjiang Jiangsu With everyone believing that Chens army movement was in response to report that Northern Qi was planning to attack Jiankangs defense forces made no effort to resist and Chen surprised Wang killing him and seizing power Two days after Wangs death Xiao Yuanming abdicated and moved out of the palace returning to his private residence Chen made Xiao Fangzhi emperor as Emperor Jing

Emperor Jing formally made Xiao Yuanming prime minister and created him the greater title of Duke of Jianan although there is no evidence that Xiao Yuanming yielded much actual power

In light of the coup Northern Qi launched a major attack on Liang in winter 555 aided by Liang generals loyal to Wang Sengbian The Northern Qi and Liang armies following Chen Baxians orders stalemated for months In summer 556 Northern Qi generals invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp for peace negotiations and Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to the Northern Qi camp However before any negotiations could commence Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back In 558 Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia Emperor Yuans grandson who was proclaimed Liangs emperor by the general Wang Lin following Chens seizure of the throne from Emperor Jing earlier that year honored Xiao Yuanming as Emperor Mina posthumous name recognized by but rarely used by traditional historians

Gaganbawada
Gaganbawada is a town situated in the district of Kolhapur in Maharashtra India It is located 55km by road from Kolhapur It is the taluka headquarters

Gaganbawada is situated on the sahyadri range or the western ghats also has a very famous fort Gagangad near it Gaganbawada though only 55km from Kolhapur is non developed and hilly area of the district Gaganbawada gets the maximum rainfall during rainy season 
Gaganbawada is on threshold of famous Karul Ghat  Bhuibawada Ghat
Perhaps the only place having two ghats originating at a single place but going towards different directions one towards TalereKankavali Karul Ghat
and another towards KharepatanRajapur Bhuibawada Ghat 
The Kolhapur district boundary ends immediately after Gaganbawada and Sindhudurg District starts just at the beginning of Karul Ghat and Bhuibawada Ghat
From Gaganbawada bus stand road to the left will take one to the Karul Ghat and road to the right will take you to the Bhuibawada Ghat 
The Karul Ghat starts immediately after Gaganbawada village 1km from bus stand
Karul Ghat goes towards Northern part of Sindhudurg District Tha quality of road is good Length of Karul Ghat is 11km The entire ghat comes under the administration of Vaibhavwadi Tehsil of Sindhudurg
This ghat is beautiful and very scenic in monsoon This ghat ends just before Vaibhavwadi and the state highway ends at Talere village NH 17
The other ghat called Bhuibawada Ghat starts at the right turn from Gaganbawada Bus stand
This entire ghat also comes in Vaibhavwadi Tehsil of Sindhudurg The ghat is of 10km length with medium quality road and useful for people going towards southern part of Ratnagiri Districts Rajapur area This ghat ends at Bhuibawada and this road will further take one to Kharepatan Town NH 17

Gaganbawada used to be called Bawada Mahal and comprise the current Gaganbawada tehsil of Kolhapur district and the current entire tehsil of Vaibhavwadi of Sindhudurg district In 1981 Sindhudurg became the independent district The entire Vaibhavwadi area which used to be a part of Gaganbawada Tehsil was at the foothills of Sahyadri and it was very tedious for people living at the foothills to come to Gaganbawaba for their daily needs So the portion of Sahyadri foothills was separated from Gaganbawada tehsil of Kolhapur District and joined to the Sindhudurg District At that time the villages called Vaibhavwadi Karul Bhuibawada Umbarde Tithavali Achirne etc became a part of Sindhudurg district and Vaibhavwadi became the tehsil headquarters
Now the funny thing is The Gagangiri Ashram and fort is only 1km from Gaganbawada of Kolhapur district above Sahyadri range but geographically it is a part of Vaibhavwadi Tehsil of Sindhudurg district which is at the foothills of Sahyadri range
During the rule of the Marathas and British raj the Bavda estate was 243 sqmi in extent


The famous Marathi movies called Pacchadlela 2004 and Kaal Ratri Bara Vajta 1991 
were shot in the village of Palsambe just 7km before Gaganbawada on KolhapurGaganbawada road The wada Bunglow shown in these movies is very scenic place Kumbhi river flows behind it

Gaganbawada offers you most scenic views of mighty mountain ranges of Western Ghats Each season the view will be different and magnificent The misty mountains and lush green hills of Gaganbawada are treat to the eyes Its serene and calm surroundings are real delight Gaganbawada has rich historical and mythological background It also has a gift of diverse biodiversity The flora and fauna in the forests around Gaganbawada will mesmerise any nature lover

Edward Johnson tenor
Edward Patrick Johnson CBE 22 August 187820 April 1959 was a Canadian operatic tenor who was billed outside North America as Edoardo Di Giovanni He became general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in Manhattan New York City from 1935 to 1950

Born in Guelph Ontario Canada Johnson was the son of James Johnson and the former Margaret Jane Brown The young tenor sang in his local church choir and at events in the Guelph area At a concert in Stratford Ontario in 1897 contralto Edith Miller encouraged him to move to New York and pursue a singing career He sang as a soloist with several church choirs in the New York area After this period he did much concert work touring through the MidWest with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and singing in many Music Festivals throughout the country After a peripatetic existence for some years working in a variety of venues and training with several masters he made his concert debut at Carnegie Hall in 1904

Johnson sang the lead role in the North American premiere of Oscar Strauss A Waltz Dream in 1907 In 1908 he moved to Paris France and began training under Richard Barthlemy He married Beatrice dArneiro in London in August 1909 His only child Fiorenza was born 21 December 1910 She married George Drew who later became Premier of Ontario and Federal Leader of the Opposition and died in 1965

Johnson went to Italy in 1909 studying voice with Vincenzo Lombardi in Florence When singing outside North America Johnson called himself Edoardo Di Giovanni He made his opera debut on 10 January 1912 as Andrea Chnier at Paduas Teatro Verdi After his dbut in Padua he became leading tenor at La Scala Milan for five consecutive seasons In Rome he spent four seasons at the Costanzi Theatre where among other roles he sang Luigi and Rinuccio in the Italian premiere of Il trittico In 1914 he sang the title role in the first performance in Italian of Richard Wagners Parsifal under the baton of Arturo Toscanini He sang in Madrid Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires His London debut was in Gounods Faust alongside Nellie Melba

He suffered a heart attack and died while attending a National Ballet recital at the Guelph Memorial Gardens

If you get right down to the bottom there are in reality not so many singing rules to learn You sing on the five vowels and when you can do them loudly softly and with mezzo voce you have a foundation upon which to build vocal mastery And yet some people study eight ten years without really laying the foundation Why should it take the singer such a long time to master the material of his equipment A lawyer or doctor after leaving college devotes three or four years only to preparing himself for his profession receives his diploma then sets up in business It ought not to be so much more difficult to learn to sing than to learn these other professions Edward Johnson
Of course the ear is the most important factor our greatest ally It helps us imitate Imitation forms a large part of our study We hear a beautiful tone we try to imitate it we try in various ways with various placements until we succeed in producing the sound we have been seeking Then we endeavor to remember the sensations experienced in order that we may repeat the tone at will So you see Listening Imitation and Memory are very important factors in the students development Edward Johnson
The old Italian operas cultivate the bel canto that isbeautiful singing Of course it is well for the singer to cultivate this first of all for it is excellent and necessary for the voice But modern Italian opera portrays the real men and women of today who live enjoy suffer are angry and repentant Bel canto will not express these emotions When a man is jealous or in a rage he will not stand quietly in the middle of the stage and sing beautiful tones Edward Johnson
I feel that if I have worked out a characterization I must stick to my idea in spite of what others say It is my own conception and I must either stand or fall by it At times I have tried to follow the suggestions of this or that critic and have changed my interpretation to suit their taste But it always rendered me self conscious made my work unnatural and caused me speedily to return to my own conception Edward Johnson

Beautiful Festival of the Valley
The Beautiful Festival of the Valley was an Ancient Egyptian festival celebrated annually in Thebes Luxor during the Middle Kingdom period and later

The sacred barques of the wind deity AmunRe his consort Mut and son Khonsu left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased royalty on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis

The Beautiful Festival of the Valley or heb nefer en inet in Egyptian was a celebration of the dead
The Beautiful Festival of the Valley could be more ancient than the Opet Festival as it can be traced back to the Middle Kingdom
It was said to be held as a remembrance of the dead from the beginning of the Middle Kingdom
However when joined with the Festival of Opet the holy procession became the main event of the liturgical calendar of Thebes
The annual festival was held at the New Moon of Month Two This was the summer season shemu and the 10th month in a calendar of 12
During Hatshepsuts reign she carried out both the Opet and The Beautiful Festival of the Valley to Amun

There was a grand precession at the start of the festival which could go for several days
It was a colourful and joyous occasion for the people of Thebes
The procession would be led by Amun from the East rising sun new life the direction of the living to the West setting sun land of the dead
A statue or picture of Amun decorated with a broad collar and sun disk would be led by priests down the Nile in a ceremonial boat or barque
This barque would then be placed in a Userhet that was covered in gold and precious materials
This Userhet would be followed by boats for Mut and Khonsu to form the Theban Triad
The procession proceeded to the Temple of Million Years of the King where the townspeople would sacrifice food and drink as well as flowers to the flotilla of boats
Great quantities of flowers would be presented as it is believed by the Egyptian culture that the flowers became filled with the essence of the deity
Townspeople then took these flowers to their relatives tombs to pay their respects and ensure the revival of the deceaseds spirit
They would drink and sleep on the deceaseds tombs as different levels of consciousness blessed the dead and brought them closer to god
Amuns shrine was brought into the Djoserdjoseru to reaffirm the bond between the king of the gods and the king of the people

Panta bhat
Poitabhat or panta bhat
  Pnt bht is ricebased dish prepared by soaking rice generally leftover in water overnight Traditionally served in the morning with salt onion and chili It is consumed in Bangladesh and the eastern Indian states of Odisha  West Bengal Assam Tripura It is a popular dish on the day of Pohela Boishakh or Bengali new year It has been described in documents from 17th century Panta bhat has more micronutrients than fresh rice It is traditionally considered as beneficial in feverish conditions Pakhala a similar dish is popular in Odisha Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh It is consumed in East and South East Asia as well In China it is known as Jiuniang and eaten mostly in the Sinchuan and Yunnan regions

Anthropologist Tapan Kumar Sanyal argues that protoAustraloid people of South Asia resorted the panta bhat because they cooked once a day in the evening During the Mughal Era members of sociocultural organizations performed open air concerts the audience listening to the concert and eating traditional food particularly panta bhat Friar Sebastian Manrique reported from his visit of Bengal in 17th century that the people of all communities according to Manrique were contented then with the daily meal of rice often panta bhat salt and green vegetable shak The betteroff elements of the society consumed ghee butter milk and various lacteous preparations and sweetmeats

Rice researcher Mahabub Hossain of International Rice Research Institute explains that in the past people engaged in farm work preferred bold and brown rice which is more suited for watered rice and also provides more nutrition But as more people shifted to urban centers the demand for farm work brown rice and watered rice decreased In these times of polished rice the popularity of rice varieties like Lal Swarna and White Swarna is often driven by their suitability for panta bhat

There are many variations of the dish though all are made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight Rice is boiled the usual way Then phaen or starch is strained away Rice is cooled in air temperature for 34 hours Then cool water is added in a way that about an inch of water rises above the rice Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric 1224 hours later panta bhat is ready Panta bhat retains its taste for 23 days The fluid portion is called amani or torani and may be specially prepared Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination

The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt lime chili either raw or roasted and onions sliced or whole mostly for flavor Panta bhat is often served with fried fish or vegetable curry or flattened rice chira dried cane or palm molasses jaggery or gurh and milk curd doi Water is discarded before consumption Sometimes edible oils may be added Panta bhat or poita bhat is often garnished with mustard oil onion chilli pickle and served with shutki mach dried fish machher jhol fish curry especially shorshe Ilish ilish cooked with mustard seeds aloo bhorta or aloo pitika mashed potato begun bhorta mashed brinjal and other bhorta or pitika mashed food

A similar dish consumed in the Indian states of Orissa and Chhattisgarh is known as Pakhala also pakhal pokhalo or pakhal bhat It differs from panta bhat in seasoning as yoghurt is sometimes added prior to the fermentation process Pazhedhu saadham meaning old rice of Tamil Nadu is another variation of the dish

Panta bhat is especially popular in rural areas generally served with salt raw onion and green chili It is usually served as breakfast though noon or evening consumption is not uncommon Panta bhat and other low nutrition food are consumed as fillers between meals Panta bhat is one of the cool dishes popular in Bengal meaning it helps keep cool during the summer This cold and wet food is suitable for summer mornings but in winter dry foods such as chira flattened rice and muri puffed rice are more preferred

In Bangladesh as well West Bengal it is a part of the Pohela Boishakh Bengali new year festival festivities On that day it is consumed as breakfast by urban people Panta is also served at highend eateries in Bangladesh and West Bengal on the day Foodstalls maintained mostly by student groups on fairgrounds also serve pantailish Panta bhat on Pohela Boishakh is often served with fried hilsha ilish and students of Pabna Science and Technology University PUST assaulted their student counselor for not providing pantailish in the Pohela Boishakh of 2014 But the practice takes a toll on the hilsha population during the breeding season Since 2016 Bangladesh government banned hilsha fishing and selling in the times of Pohela Boishakh ministers started urging people to have panta without ilish and social media baceme rife with calls for panta without ilish

Among Hindu Bengalis it is consumed during the Ranna Puja Bengali cooking festival During Ranna Puja panta bhat is offered to Manasa the snake goddess along with fried vegetables yellow pigeon peas cooked with elephant apples curried ash gourd and fried Hilsa On the Vijayadashami day of Durga Puja panta bhat is offered to Durga along with soup of grass pea fried taro leaves machher jhol of blue perch and chutney of elephant apple for Sabarna Roy Choudhury Atchala Durga in Kolkata In Assam offering Dudh Panta milk with stale watersoaked rice is a part of the marital ritual In Northeast India there is a belief that taking painta or panta bhat gives the strength of a tiger Panta bhat is also popular among slumdwellers of Dhaka because it can be easily eaten only with salt or with an onion or a fried or green chili without any other requirement

Most restaurants on NH34 which runs through Krishnanagar Nadia serve panta bhat in summer along with kasundi mustard oil kaffir lime green chili sliced onion aloo chokha fried red chili Poppy seed balls aloo jhuri bhaja mango chutney sour curd and sweet paan Nabanno Hyderabad a Bengaliowned restaurant in Kukatpally Hyderabad serve panta bhat all the year round

There are many folk rhymes and proverbs about panta bhat shashuri nai nonod nai kar ba kori daragey khai panta bhat sheshe lepi ghar lit no motherinlaw no sisterinlaw whom do I fear shall eat watered rice first then clean the room maga bhat tay basi ar pantalit got rice begging ask not whether stale or watered ki katha bolbo saipanta bhate tak dai lit what do I say sour curd on watered rice panta bhate noon jote nabegun poday ghee lit no salt in watered riceghee in roasted brinjal noon ante panta phuray lit when salt arrives the panta is finished mude mai radhe natapta ar panta lit mother does not cookso why ask hot or cold and bandir kame yash naipanta bhate kash nai lit no merit in a maids workno fun in watered rice

In a study conducted by agricultural biotechnology department of the Assam Agricultural University it was concluded that cooked rice had an element that prevented the availability of minerals like iron potassium sodium and calcium in high quantities and the breakdown of the nutritional inhibitor by the lactic acid bacteria increased the mineral content manifolds According to Madhumita Barooah one of the researchers About 100gm of cooked rice has only 34mg of iron while for the same quantity of rice fermented for 12 hours the iron content went up to 7391mg Likewise sodium which was 475mg came down to 303mg potassium went up to 839mg and calcium went up from 21mg per 100gm of cooked rice to 850mg after 12 hours of fermentation of the same quantity of rice According to another study ILSI 1998 fermentation improves the bioavailability of minerals such as iron and zinc as a result of phytic acid hydrolysis and increases the content of riboflavin and vitamin B

Panta bhat has some remedial use It is considered as a cold food by Ayurveda traditions while boiled rice is neutral Hence is a preferred food for children with a fever Panta bhat also contains a small amount of alcohol as a result of fermentation When the conditions of preparing panta bhat  keeping rice soaked overnight in water  were simulated in the laboratory the rice was found to be inoculated with veratridine a steroidderived alkaloid

Despite its nutritional and remedial values panta bhat is often contaminated with almost 90 of the samples containing fecal coliforms with a median count of 39 log cfuml The contamination was more in the rainy season Numbers of fecal coliforms increased 10fold when there was a delay of more than 4 hours between preparation and consumption 90 of the samples were eaten more than 12 hours after preparation Contamination increased during the rainy season A tenfold increase in contamination was observed between 4 hours of soaking and 16 hours of soaking In cases of diarrhoea this stale rice is not to be served to the patient though boiled rice and ricewater are often prescribed as diarrheal treatment

Weasel Marvel Comics
Weasel Jack Hammer is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics Weasel is a friend sidekick information broker and arms dealer for Deadpool Weasel is perhaps Deadpools best friend However because of his frequent mood swings and tenuous mental state Deadpool still often abuses or mistreats him Weasel has also displayed an opportunistic streak against his friends interests on occasions

Actor T J Miller portrays Weasel in the 2016 feature film Deadpool and its 2018 sequel Deadpool 2

Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist Klaus Janson Weasel first appeared in Cable 3 July 1993

Weasel was once a bright young lad attending Empire State University where he was a classmate of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy Weasel then known by his birth name of Jack Hammer was competing with Parker for a prestigious job under the wing of Norman Osborn and held an enormous crush on Stacy Parkers future girlfriend Deadpool accidentally teleported into the past during a fight with the Great Lakes Avengers In the past he found Jack Hammer whose future he was well aware of Disguised as Peter Parker Deadpool related to Norman Osborn false information about Jack Hammer being a drug user His employment opportunity thus ruined Hammer was manipulated by the disguised Deadpool into fixing his teleportation belt With the gadget fixed Deadpool returns to the future leaving a depressed and drunken young Hammer with a new career option crime

From that point on Hammer adopted the name of Weasel and turned to a life consisting of providing intelligence weapons and other technological devices to mercenaries and criminals sometimes partaking in mercenary activities himself It is during this period that Weasel from his perspective first met Deadpool in Canada apparently meeting not long after Deadpool left Weapon X Weasel quickly proved himself as an able informant and arms supplier to Deadpool and eventually came to form an uneasy friendship with him He assisted his friend behind the scenes as Deadpool eventually came to work for a crime lord named Tolliver After Tollivers apparent death the two competed against a slew of other mercenaries villains heroes and assassins to become the beneficiaries of Tollivers will and later came to work at the Hellhouse a hotbed of mercenary activity in Chicago where jobs were dispensed to those willing to take them Deadpool due to his prowess and cold heart came to be feared and respected there but often butted heads with another powerful mercenary TRay During this time The Taskmaster abducted Weasel in order to procure his services Initially allowing Deadpool to track him down then switching off his tracking device which was attuned to his heart shortly before Taskmaster defeated Deadpool Weasel revealed his confusion to both mercenaries due to Taskmasters sweetened offer in spite of the somewhat mercurial loyalties shared between himself and Deadpool However when his friend baffled and conclusively defeated Taskmaster he chose to return to his employ encouraged in part by Deadpools show of compassion for him and the promise of a new cable connection to the Playboy Channel Weasel tried to mention Siryn knowing the positive influence the Irish mutant had over Deadpool Once again he was cowed by threats of physical violence His loyalties to Deadpool were also further shown at the Hellhouse when it became apparent that TRay maintained a grip of intimidation over the other mercenaries when Deadpool was absent even though he was in no position to stand up to TRay directly Ultimately TRay decided to organize a showdown with Deadpool and told Weasel to relay that information to Deadpool In an effort to get in touch with his friend before the appointed showdown time Weasel teleported to Deadpools San Francisco home  a definite nono He was shooed out by Deadpools friendprisoner Blind Al but when Weasel later made repeated visits to her Deadpool discovered him there and placed both him and Blind Al in the Box a dark room so filled with sharp objects and instruments of torture that movement is almost impossible This latest abuse was the breaking point  Weasel decided to move on and left Deadpool after escaping from the Box hoping to define his life outside of his association with Deadpool

Fate had other designs however After Deadpools death and subsequent resurrection some time afterward Weasel ran into an amnesiac Deadpool He helped to restore Deadpools memory and thus restored their friendship before leaving once more An onagain offagain association between the two occurred after this point with Deadpool sometimes asking for goods or working with Weasel However another breaking point came when Deadpool stood up for Weasel when he was found hacking into a computer When Deadpool found out that Weasel had lied he refused to help Weasel who was sent to jail Weasel decided to atone for this crime by faithfully serving his time and when he got out coincidentally worked a job with Deadpool in Rumekistan With Weasel having served time to appease Deadpools anger and with Deadpool having TiVod all the episodes of Battlestar Galactica during Weasels stay in jail to make up for his past abuses the two became fast friends once more He assisted Deadpool in the mercenarys latest voyage of selfdiscovery as Deadpool put himself in a series of situations to regain his rep as a mercenary then made another attempt to become a hero Weasel had Deadpool shrunk down to keyring size in order to bolster his selfconfidence as he was no less effective in his greatly reduced size On the last of these missions Weasel was left in a Hydra base during an attack that was an attempt to give Deadpool more streetcred While being imprisoned on the base Weasel was apparently able to instead join Hydra naming himself The Penetraitor and created a teleportation machine for Hydras use This was interrupted by an attack on the base by Wolverine coinciding with an attempted rescue by Deadpool and Bob Agent of HYDRA Deadpool and Bob were there because they knew Wolverines attack would put Weasels life in danger Furthermore Weasels seeming joining of Hydra was a ruse his teleportation gift simply sent the users straight to an American controlled prison Although he is not explicitly stated to be a pet owner Weasel takes Blind Als dog at her request when he leaves Deadpool and later on is shown to have a white cat in his apartment

Weasel becomes an associate of the good guy mercenary firm Agency X

Weasel returns in Deadpool vol 2 23 as Las Vegas hero The House He is funded by the local casinos and takes pleasure at the chance to fight Deadpool Using his vast knowledge of Deadpool he quickly traps and defeats him ultimately locking Wade in his own version of the Box Deadpool quickly and inexplicably escapes and offers Weasel a chance to double his earnings He then takes Weasels extra suit of armor and the alias Wildcard acting as The Houses sidekick Later in an encounter with a new Grizzly unbeknownst to Weasel Deadpool secretly tells Griz about a proposition he has for him Grizzly manages to escape and later when Weasel and Deadpool meet with the casino owners Deadpool reveals that he is in fact Wildcard much to Weasels fury Later Wade persuades Weasel to switch suits so that all the praise Wildcard gets will be for Weasels good deeds Weasel agrees to the plan and the two once again face off with Grizzly now back again and attempting to steal the millions of dollars in the casinos counting room In the ensuing battle Weasel fights Grizzly in the Wildcard suit while Deadpool sips drinks as The House Unfortunately everyone thinks Weasel is the one in The House suit drinking Lime Rickeys and worst of all Deadpool runs off with Grizzly and the cash So when Deadpool tells the casino bosses that Weasel took off with the money because he wasnt getting any respect they all believe him They also believe him when he tells them that Weasel will be returning first thing in the morning Meanwhile Weasel talks on the phone with Blind Al seeking advice and resolves to take Deadpool down against Blind Als protests and then spots an explosion in the distance As it turns out the explosion was caused by Deadpool back at the casino with Grizzly and attempting to rob the vault While Grizzly heads for the vault himself Weasel arrives in the Wildcard suit and confronts Deadpool who is still in The Houses suit In a parody of The Empire Strikes Back Deadpool asks Weasel to join him Weasel refuses and seemingly kills Deadpool by blowing his head off Grizzly ends up being locked in the casino vault though he still has the money The casino owners still think that Weasel was the one in The House suit so everyone ends up cheering for him as Grizzly is arrested Later in his lair Weasel converses again with Blind Al who insists that he tell the casino bosses the truth Weasel is skeptical but Blind Al reminds him about the possibility that they could have found Deadpools body by now Weasel then receives a call from the casino owners who reveal that they found no body Deadpool shows up and explains that he snuck out of the suit under cover of the smoke from the explosion and that the money in the casino vault was actually counterfeit money with his face on it Weasel assumes that Deadpool will kill him but Deadpool says that he wont that he will help Weasel out of his jam that he will take over the Wildcard suit and that Weasel will have to lie low When Weasel asks where he will go Deadpool replies I think we both know the answer to that one buddy Later when Deadpool meets with the casino owners they claim that he said hed taken care of Weasel When they ask him how he replies I put him in a Box

Weasel is later freed from the Box by Macho Gomez who recruits him to his team of people who were screwed over by and want revenge on Deadpool and they confront him in Bob Agent of HYDRAs garage In the ensuing battle Weasel begins to have second thoughts saying to himself Stupid stupid stupidI never shoulda come here Deadpools gonna do somethin horrible to me I know it to which Deadpool responds from across the room Hey Weasel Come over here so I can do something horrible to you Fortunately for Weasel the team minus Sluggo whom Weasel inadvertently killed managed to defeat Deadpool and Weasel and the others left unscathed But since they did not actually kill him Deadpool managed to come back and kill Weasel as payback for joining Macho Gomez

After his death Weasel was condemned to Hell which he escapes from with the help of Mephisto Rechristening himself Patient Zero he then sets out to get revenge on both Deadpool and Peter Parker hiring the former to assassinate the latter after making it look like torturous human experimentation was being conducted at Parker Industries which Patient Zero also steals data from for use in transforming captured homeless people into Manstrosities After the Manstrosities are defeated in a confrontation with SpiderMan and Deadpool Patient Zero splices the two heroes DNA into another test subject turning her into Itsy Bitsy a psychotic vigilante with the combined powers of both Deadpool and SpiderMan When his creation turns on him a desperate Patient Zero reaches out to SpiderMan and Deadpool for aid and is killed in front of them by Itsy Bitsy

Patient Zero is then returned to Hell and eventually visited by Deadpool to whom he reveals his identity explaining that he was motivated by Deadpools past abuse and the belief that Deadpool has not changed and has tricked the world into believing that deep down he is nothing more than a scumridden murdering psychopath

Weasel is afterward shown being offered another deal by Mephisto This one involving Deadpool

Jack Hammer has no superpowers but he is an expert hacker and inventor with a geniuslevel intellect and knowledge of many weapons


Weasel appears as a nonplayable associate of Deadpool in the video game  voiced by Cam Clarke He is part of a subplot to discover if Nick Furys secondincommand Black Widow is a SHIELD traitor and requires information gathered by the player in between the missions to help him work such as passwords named after other characters other hackers likely to assist him or suitable hiding places to avoid being found by SHIELD In the Sanctum Sanctorum Weasel asks the players if he would be able to hide out at the Baxter Building or the XMansion As Hank Pym states that Mister Fantastic tends to work with SHIELD The heroes tell Weasel to hide out at the XMansion since Professor X stated that SHIELD Agents on XMansion grounds would not sit well with the XMen Later on in Asgard he develops a crush on Valkyrie who prefers Deadpool and his sense of humor Deadpool states to Valkyrie that Weasel has that way with women ever since he brought his cousin to the prom Storm mentions to the players about how some of the XMen got annoyed with Weasel activating different vehicles and equipment without their authorization A phone call made during the credits reveal that the Black Widow had been using Weasel to steal information from SHIELD then setting up Weasel for the fall As can be expected he has unique dialogue with Deadpool revealing that Weasel had recently been discharged from the hospital after he and Deadpool fought over cheese puffs and Deadpool stabbed him in the leg

Honda RC212V
The Honda RC212V is a Japanese road racing motorcycle developed to race in the MotoGP series Officially introduced on 30 October 2006 as the RC211V replacement in the MotoGP series it was developed by Honda Racing Corporation HRC throughout 2006 and began officially racing in the 2007 season

The model name designates the following

The RC212V features an liquidcooled fourstroke DOHC 4valve V4 to power the all new chassis built with mass centralization and handling as top priority

Dani Pedrosa and Nicky Hayden rode the factorybacked versions while the customer machines were ridden by Marco Melandri Toni Elas Carlos Checa and Shinya Nakano A perennial issue with Hondas GP motorcycle is which team and rider receives the best parts and whether performance differences are due to the rider not the machine Before the racing season started in 2007 Melandri was quoted as saying In the past few tests Ive seen a big progression with Pedrosas bike but were still waiting for new parts from Honda

After a few rounds Honda riders did not achieve the results expected leading HRC chief Satoru Horiike to admit that they made a mistake in the motorcycles development Melandri decided to ride with the Ducati team in 2008 and Pedrosas dissatisfaction led to rumors that he was leaving Honda Towards the end of 2007 however there were signs of improvement with the Repsol Honda team taking the last five pole positions of the season and Pedrosa winning the last round at Valencia

For 2008 HRC planned to use pneumatic valve springs and an allnew chassis The mass centralization of the 2007 model was thought to have gone too far and instead the 2008 model is more open reducing heat and improving balance The factory team riders are Pedrosa through 2009 and Hayden through 2008 Satellite team riders are Nakano Andrea Dovizioso Randy de Puniet and Alex de Angelis
The 2008 pneumatic valve version has only been available to the Repsol Honda team and in preseason testing it has been highly problematic The original intent of running an allnew engine and chassis was shelved when the engine did not perform to expectations Pedrosa and Hayden then tested a 2007 engine in a 2008 chassis and after still being near the bottom of testing timesheets the Repsol Honda team used the 2007 version in the first rounds practice for comparison purposes For the race Pedrosa chose a revised 2008 chassis while Hayden chose the 2007 The pneumatic engine was racedebuted by Hayden at the Donington round and he was charged with developing the new engine for the rest of the season Pedrosa deciding to continue using the conventional valve engine An electronic problem at the subsequent Assen round caused Hayden to run out of fuel just before the line allowing Colin Edwards to come around him and take the remaining podium position

At the 13th round it was announced that Pedrosa would switch to Bridgestone tires for the remainder of the season and he also planned to start racing the pneumatic valved engine in the 14th round at Indianapolis

Unlike the other Honda teams de Puniets Team LCR used hlins suspension instead of Showa

For 2009 the factory team riders were Pedrosa and Dovizioso and the satellite team riders were Elas De Angelis de Puniet and Yuki Takahashi Elas was given a factory spec machine The 2009 model was largely the same as the 2008 All 6 of the RC212Vs used pneumatic valve engines

After two rounds the Repsol Honda riders had only achieved a single podium Vice president of HRC Shuhei Nakamoto said If Dani does not win the world championship it is Hondas responsibility not Danis while Pedrosa said Ive spoken to Nakamoto but Ive spoken to many people like him but it seems like its three years of the same story What I really need is to see is some things coming not always just hearing talking or a meeting Id like to have something where I can say okay thank you this is good
Before Round 6 at Catalunya Dovizioso expressed frustration that Pedrosa would be given priority in the postrace test feeling that the Spaniards poor physical condition would not lead to a productive evaluation In the race Dovizioso finished in 4th place and Pedrosa in 6th and Pedrosa announced he would skip the test to rest Using the new chassis Dovizioso was top rider of the test

In practice at Round 7 at Assen Pedrosa remarked that the new chassis was an improvement in braking and stability but both Pedrosa and Dovizioso crashed in the race at the same turn At the following round at Laguna Seca Pedrosa won the race while Dovizioso crashed out

In postrace testing at Brno the Repsol team tested hlins suspension components which until then had been using Showa For the San Marino round Dovizioso will use hlins and Pedrosa will use Showa suspension

The 2009 season ended with three wins for the Repsol Honda teamtwo for Pedrosa and one for Doviziosoand a 2nd place in the constructor championship for Honda At postrace testing at Valencia Pedrosa tested hlins suspension exclusively and the factory team tried a new chassis and swingarm Pedrosa and Dovizioso had the 3rd and 6th fastest times over the threeday test

For 2010 the factory team riders are Pedrosa and Dovizioso and the satellite team riders are Hiroshi Aoyama de Puniet Melandri and Marco Simoncelli All riders are using hlins suspension components this year The electronic systems were given an update and the bike is shorter with a higher center of gravity Also Honda hired Andre Zugna and Cristian Battaglia formerly Yamaha race engineers and Carlo Luzzi formerly Jorge Lorenzos telemetry technician at Yamaha

According to one analysis of preseason tests at Sepang and Qatar Doviziosos average placing in the tests was third while Pedrosas was ninth Pedrosa complained of problems with the suspension and chassis and at the first race of the season in Qatar Dovizioso finished third while Pedrosa finished in seventh place Pedrosa experienced speed wobbles down the front straight and Honda determined that they had committed a mistake in the design of the chassis and that by trying to make the bike easier to ride they made it too flexible

By the following round at Jerez Pedrosa had a new chassis and finished the race in second place and Dovizioso finished in sixth in the test after the race Pedrosa finished fastest and Dovizioso fifth using a new swingarm that Pedrosa used in the race and also a new chassis Pedrosa later said and Honda confirmed that a fuel sensor problem slowed down the RC212V in the final laps and may have cost him the victory at Jerez

At the third round at Le Mans Dovizioso finished the race in third and Pedrosa in fifth the latter getting passed in the last lap by Dovizioso and Hayden and later reporting problems with the rear brake Melandri had switched back to Showa suspension and finished in sixth place At the fourth round at Mugello Pedrosa won the race Dovizioso finished third and Melandri finished fifth Pedrosa used a 2009 model rear shock During first practice at the 14th round at Motegi the throttle cable stuck and caused Pedrosa to crash and break his collarbone causing him to miss the race and putting him out of contention for the championship At the 16th round in Australia Doviziosos steering damper had a problem forcing him to retire from the race The season ended with Honda placing second in the MotoGP constructor championship with 342 points 62 points behind firstplace Yamaha and 56 points ahead of thirdplace Ducati

For 2011 the factory supported riders were Andrea Dovizioso Dani Pedrosa Casey Stoner and Marco Simoncelli while the satellite supported riders were Hiroshi Aoyama and Toni Elas Honda riders dominated preseason testing Frame geometry and rigidity are the same as the previous year making the 2011 bike an evolution of the 2010 version One of the improvements to the 2011 machine is a seamless transmission Stoner and Dovizioso chose to use the 2011 chassis while Pedrosa decided to stay with the more flexible 2010 version

After the third round at Estoril Dovizioso began to use a new clutch designed to reduce hopping under braking

Honda won the manufacturers championship with 13 wins between Stoners ten and Pedrosas three and never finished lower than second in race results The factory RC212V was retired at the end of the season to make way for the 2012 RC213V though leased models will still be raced by satellite teams

<doc id="7723284" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723284" title="Dry fly fishing">
Dry fly fishing
Dry fly fishing is an angling technique in which the lure is an artificial fly which floats on the surface of the water and does not get wet Developed originally for trout fishing it is sometimes regarded as the supreme fishing sport owing to its difficulty in both manual dexterity and understanding of the fish in its environment However it is also enjoyable and is widely practised

Fly fishing for trout is a popular sport which can be done using various methods with the appropriate types of flies Trout mostly feed near the bed of the stream where wet flies and especially nymphs are used They typically only come to the surface to feed when there is a large bug hatch during which thousands of aquatic insects grow wings and leave the water to mate and lay eggs Particularly during the summer months and on smaller mountain streams trout also often feed on terrestrial insects such as ants beetles and grasshoppers when they fall onto the water surface It is on these surfacefeeding occasions that the dry fly can be an effective lure

At certain times Salmon will also rise to a fly on the surface and dry flies may also be used to fish for them

The aim of dryfly fishing is to mimic the downstream drifting of a real fly on the surface of the water To be successful it requires both manual skill and a good knowledge of the fish and its surroundings It is also a pleasurable occupation on a slow dreamy Summers day Because of this it gained a reputation as the aristocrat of angling sports superior to all other kinds of angling Consequently good trout streams command a premium price

Dry fly fishing uses a line and flies that float They are joined by a fine 3 to 5 meters long leader typically of nylon monofilament line which is tapered so that it is nearly invisible where the fly is knotted and the angler can replace the last meter or so of nylon as required 

Most of a trouts food is carried to it on the current so they tend to face upstream with their attention focused into the current Trout fishermen therefore prefer to begin downstream of the fishs suspected lie and work upstream into the current Trout can see a wide area around them so the angler must stay not only downstream of the fish but also as low to the ground and as far from the bank as possible moving upstream with stealth

Trout tend to strike their food at current edges where faster and slowermoving waters mix Obstructions to the stream flow such as large rocks or nearby pools provide a low energy environment where fish sit and wait for food without expending much energy Casting upstream to the edge of the slower water the angler can see the fly land and drift slowly back downstream 
The fly should land softly as if dropped onto the water with the leader fully extended from the fly line

The challenge in stream fishing is to place the fly with deadly accuracy within inches of a protective rock for instance to mimic the behaviour of a real fly When done properly the fly appears to be just floating along in the current with a perfect drift as if not connected to the fly line The angler must remain vigilant for the take in order to be ready to raise the rod tip and set the hook

Due to rivers having faster and slower currents often running side by side the fly can overtake or be overtaken by the line thus disturbing the flys drift Mending is a technique whereby one lifts and moves the part of the line that requires realigning with the flys drift thus extending the drag free drift The mend can be upstream or downstream depending on the currents carrying the line or fly To be effective any mending of the fly line should not disturb the natural drift of the fly Learning to mend is often much easier if the angler can see the fly

Unlike wet fly fishing the take on a dry fly is visible explosive and exciting Right from the beginning anglers often prefer dry fly fishing because of the relative ease of detecting a strike and the instant gratification of seeing a trout strike their fly Nymph fishing may be more productive but dry fly anglers can become addicted to the surface strike

Once a fish has been caught and landed the fly may be wet and no longer float well Flies can sometimes be dried by false casting back and forth in the air With care a small piece of reusable absorbent towel an amadou patch or a Chamois leather may be used A used dry fly which refuses to float may be replaced with another similar or identical fly while the original dries out more thoroughly rotating through a set of flies After drying a fly may need a fresh application of waterrepellent fly dressing liquid

A dry fly is designed to land softly on the surface of the water without breaking it and becoming wetted It need not be inherently buoyant They are often oiled or treated with another water repellent Dry flies are generally considered to be freshwater flies

A dry fly may be of the imitation or attractor type Imitations typically represent the adult form of an aquatic or terrestrial insect such as the elk hair caddis a caddisfly imitation The small blue winged olive is another common fly for which several imitators have been designed A beginner may wish to begin with a fly that is easier to see such as the Royal Wulff attractor or a mayfly imitation such as a parachute adams The parachute on the parachute adams helps the fly to land as softly as a natural on the water and has the added benefit of making the fly very visible from the surface Being able to see the fly easily is helpful to the beginner 

A translucent fly seen from underneath with sunlight shining through it looks very different to a fly when out of the sun Some dry flies especially imitators are especially designed to mimic this effect J W Dunne developed a technique of painting the shaft of the hook white and wrapping it in translucent artificial silk which he then oiled

Salmon flies such as the Parks Salmonfly are usually larger than trout flies

Dry fly fishing first became a serious sport in the 19th century with the publication by Frederic M Halford of two books Floating Flies and How to Dress Them and DryFly Fishing in Theory and Practice His artificials were designed to imitate real flies but they only did so under limited conditions This led J W Dunne to develop a theory of trout vision and from it a series of imitators intended for use in sunny weather which he published in 1924 as Sunshine and the Dry Fly

Meanwhile G E M Skues had begun promoting wet nymph fishing He went on to popularise the use of attractors designed to goad the fish rather than to fool it Skues approach outraged the traditionalists who favoured the dry fly and in 1938 the Flyfishers Club staged what amounted to an inquisition hearing against him However Skues approach proved more effective in the majority of situations

Dry fly fishing has remained a popular sport

Hugh Stretton
Professor emeritus Hugh Stretton AC 15 July 1924  18 July 2015 was an Australian historian urban theorist and a Rhodes Scholar He was a key figure in the development and implementation of government policies affecting cities particularly during the Whitlam Government

Stretton was born in Cambrai Private Hospital St Kilda East He was educated at Mentone Grammar School and Scotch College Melbourne for his secondary school years He subsequently enrolled at the University of Melbourne for his undergraduate education However the ongoing Second World War interrupted his studies and he served in the Royal Australian Navy He enlisted as a rating on 5 May 1943 having declined a commission Stretton was posted to numerous supply depots and ships throughout his service including HMAS Penguin in Sydney and two corvettes based out of Darwin As a result of his he did not complete his studies at Melbourne

Upon his demobilisation on 8 February 1946 he successfully enrolled as a Rhodes Scholar to study history at the University of Oxford His application was supported by Sir Robert Menzies who wrote highly of him

He graduated Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts in 1948 and became a fellow in history at Balliol College During this time he also spent a year tutoring and reading history at Princeton University

Stretton remained at the College until he took up a position as Professor of History at the University of Adelaide in 1954 becoming the youngest professor in Australia at the time He stepped down from this position in 1968 and was appointed Visiting Research Fellow with the Universitys Department of Economics Upon his retirement from the University in 1989 he was awarded both with the title of emeritus professor of history and an honorary doctorate

He taught modern history and economics but wrote chiefly about town planning housing policies and social scientists ways of explaining complex historical processes He served as the deputy chair of the South Australian Housing Trust for 17 years at the behest of thenSouth Australian Premier Don Dunstan

Stretton published several books on a wide range of topics His first The Political Sciences was published in 1969 during his tenure as a Visiting Research Fellow at the Australian National University He put forward ideas on the importance of urban development for the economic development of Australia which were heavily influenced by his study and personal experience of the National Capital Development Commission

One of Strettons first and bestknown works Ideas for Australian Cities was privately published in 1970 It was widelyread and stirred considerable interest in the ideas that he presented

Stretton argued that the Australian suburb much denigrated among professional architects and planners was preferable to the agglomeration of large metropolises He stressed its social benefits and smaller scale for creating a sense of community He sought to approach urban issues from a historical and sociological perspective rather than a purely modernist or technical focus He postulated that diversity of people within a city was essential for a successful living environment However he did not consider that increasing density was the best way to achieve this goal due to the loss of vegetation and social cohesion that he considered important

Because of his background in sociology and history he was an early modern advocate of concepts now considered part of postmodernist planning methods This included social considerations such as planning for children and encounter He was able to tie in these ideas with his main contentions on the advantages of suburbs to health and wellbeing

At the time of the books publication Australia was undergoing significant social and political change culminating in the election of the sociallyprogressive Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister of Australia in 1972 Stretton was employed as a consultant to both state and federal governments over the period of the Whitlam Governments term and eventually worked with the newly established Department of Urban and Regional Development This allowed him to have a significant impact on urban policies of the Whitlam Government over the course of his term in office

Hugh Stretton died after a long illness 18 July 2015 aged 91 His passing was mourned in many Australian newspapers academic journals and other publications with the Sydney Morning Herald calling him one of Australias leading public intellectuals

His work had a profound effect on discourse in Australia across many different fields His writing activism and teaching are credited with raising important contemporary issues and leading important public debates across many decades Strettons willingness to assist both state and federal governments with policy development in a wide range of roles brought many of his ideas into the mainstream thinking and actions of bureaucracies throughout recent Australian history

The Stretton Centre was established by the University of Adelaide in 2014 and the Government of South Australia as an institute to integrate industry workplace and urban development

Hugh Stretton was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 for long service to the public housing sector

In the Queens Birthday Honours on 2004 Hugh Stretton was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia AC at the time the highest honour within the Order of Australia The citation reads For service as a historian social commentator and writer profoundly influencing and shaping ideas in the community on urban policy town planning and social and economic development

In 2006 he was voted one of Australias ten most influential public intellectuals

A portrait of Hugh Stretton by Australian artist Robert Hannaford won the Peoples Choice Award in the 1991 Archibald Prize

Josef Ritler born 1939 in Naters canton of Valais also known as Sepp Ritler or Seppi Ritler is a Swiss journalist who worked as a writer and photographer for the newspaper Blick for 40 years Today he works as a video journalist for the central Swiss television station Tele Tell

Ritlers was born in the canton of Valais He went to the local primary school in his place of birth Naters Because of bullying he was forced to change to a school in Brig In his free time he often assisted his father in his work who was a foreman wanting to follow his fathers profession when older During his apprenticeship as a mason he learnt that he had an allergy to cement and had to quit the course

But he discovered his passion for photography and began photographing everything that crossed his way He moved to Lucerne as it was one of the few locations where photography apprenticeships were offered When Ritler accidentally photographed a film set producing an army propaganda film for the Swiss national exhibition Expo 64 the paper Blick became interested in hiring Ritler as a journalist The chief editor of the time Werner Schollenberger invited Ritler to write for the paper Ritler was hesitant due to the reputation of Blick as a tabloid He eventually accepted the job offer for one year only initially Eventually he would work for Blick for forty years

The journalist managed to become something of an intermediary between the more conservative people of central Switzerland and the modern Zurich team of Blick Ritlers character attracted a considerably amount of curiosity and trouble on occasion he was chased by farmers with pitchforks his tyres were slit he received death threats and for a while was only able to work under police protection

One of Ritlers attributes is his curiosity for the people behind the headlines such as in the case of the chainsaw vigilante where Ritler was keen to find out more about the person behind the story

Ritler was only interested in real news Because of that he often held interviews after conferences not during When the Kapellbrcke was on fire Ritler was there

At the age of 64 Ritler was retired early one year before the regular Swiss retirement age and had to leave Blick He had a number of job offers and finally accepted the offer of Tele Tell where he is now working as a videojournalist

For the first time Ritler is working for TV Within this young team Ritler has a reputation for being a total professional who knows central Switzerland like no one else and who has an eye for the perfect picture

Aunty Genoa Leilani Adolpho KeaweAiko October 31 1918  February 25 2008 was a Hawaiian musician Aunty Genoa was born on the island of Oahu in the Kakaako district of Honolulu and grew up in Lie She was an icon in Hawaiian music and a mainstay on the Hawaiian music scene for more than 60 years She captivated local and visitor audiences alike She had a tremendous repertoire of traditional Hawaiian standards and Hapa Haole tunes Many local artists include Aunty Genoa Keawe among their many influences

In 2005 she received an honorary doctorate Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Hawaii

Genoa Leilani Adolphos early years were full of moving about She was born in 1918 in Kakaako in a stable In her childhood her family moved about several occasions Before she was ten years old shed already lived on Kauai for several years and had moved back to Kakaako By the time she was about 10 years old her family had moved to Laie

This move to Laie would help facilitate the phenomenal music career that would highlight her life Aunty Genoa always loved to sing ever since she was a little girl In Laie she received her early musical training as a member of a local LDS Church choir It was in choir that she built up her repertoire knowledge and appreciation of music She attended school until the 8th grade She and her husband the late Edward Puniwai KeaweAiko whom she married in 1935 had twelve children

Keawe was a lifelong member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints

She began performing music professionally prior to World War II at officers clubs and at bandstand shows in Kailua Eventually Aunty Genoa landed a radio show on KULA singing with John Kameaaloha Almeida Much like most other musicians Aunty Genoa could not make a living solely on music She also made money in her early years as a lei seller and as a taxi driver

Her long and illustrious musical career had taken her throughout the islands and around the world She had played at luaus lounges bars and on numerous radio and television shows

Aunty Genoa had taken great pride in preserving na mea Hawaii She learned to speak Hawaiian through her motherinlaw who spoke Hawaiian as her first language and became a fluent nativespeaker the term for someone who has learned Hawaiian from someone who speaks it as their first language instead of learning it in school She arguably has perhaps the widest repertoire of traditional Hawaiian meles Like many oldtime Hawaiian singers and musicians she plays her music by ear

She had been recording music professionally since 1946 Her original record label was with the 49th State Hawaii record company She then went on to record with Hula Records After a falling out with the company she founded her own record label Genoa Keawe Records to record her music and the music of her family and friends Along with the band who had often been known as Aunty Genoas Hawaiians she helped to perpetuate Hawaiian music

Tawjihi
Tawjihi or AlTawjihi      is the General Secondary Education Certificate Examination in Jordan It is the last stage of school education To sit for the exam students are required to finish 2 years of preschool education 10 years of basic education and 2 years of secondary academic or vocational educationtawjihi year Subjects in the exam include Arabic English Mathematics Physics Biology Chemistry Computer Science Geology Civil Studies and Islamic studies unless Christian 

Only those who pass the exam with a good mark may apply to proceed to university For example to be accepted to study medicine you must take the scientific stream in the last 2 years of the secondary education and get a mark not less than 85 degree out of 100 in Tawjihi exam 

Foreign secondary education programs such as GCEIGCSEGCSE SATs and International Baccalaureate require to have Tawjihiequivalency so that the student could later work in Jordan or proceed to a higher education in Jordan

Upon graduation the ministry of Higher Education transforms the GradesMarks of these foreign educational programs into the same marks used in grading Tawjihi students However even after the equivalency transformation nonTawjihi graduates are not allowed to compete with Tawjihi graduates for public university places For nonTawjihi graduates there is a set quota of 5 of places Most graduates of foreign programs end up paying international fees to get a place in their desired faculty 

Regarding the system used to transform exam results of foreign education programs into the Tawjihi scale which is a percentage out of 100 some see the system is fair and in fact over lenient with nonTawjihi graduates while others see it as unfair Below is a summary of the requirements of the Ministry of education to receive an equivalency to the Jordanian Tawjihi 

General conditions
The final percentage of a score is calculated as follows

A  98 C  75

A  95 D  65

B  85 E  55

8 subject percentages6GCSEsIGCSEs 2 Alevel subjects are added up and then the total is divided by 8

For The international baccalaureate the equivalency goes as follows
Each subject is calculated individually then they are summed up and divided by 6 then a 03 is added for each point scored from the diploma program

An example of equivalency for a science stream student
He obtained a score of 35 A 7 98 in Chemistry HL a 6 90 in Physics SL a 4 70 in ITGS SL a 5 80 in Mathematics SL a 5 80 in Arabic A1 SL a 6 90 in English B SL and 2 marks from ToK and EE 03206

Humpy
A humpy or gunyah is a small temporary shelter traditionally used by Australian Aboriginals with a standing tree usually used as the main support They are also sometimes called a leanto since it can rely on the tree for support These impermanent dwellings made of branches and bark particularly paperbark are often built prior to the construction of more permanent buildings

The word humpy comes from the Jagera language a Murri people from Coorparoo in Brisbane other language groups would have different names for the structure In South Australia such a shelter is known as a wurley also spelled wurlie possibly from the Kaurna language

Both names were adopted by early white settlers and now form part of the Australian lexicon The use of the term appears to have broadened in later usage to include any temporary building made from any available materials including canvas flattened metal drums and sheets of corrugated iron

Planum Boreum
Planum Boreum Latin the northern plain is the northern polar plain on Mars It extends northward from roughly 80N and is centered at  Surrounding the high polar plain is a flat and featureless lowland plain called Vastitas Borealis which extends for approximately 1500 kilometres southwards dominating the northern hemisphere

The main feature of the Planum Boreum is a large fissure or canyon in the polar ice cap called Chasma Boreale It is up to wide and features scarps up to high By comparison the Grand Canyon is approximately deep in some places and long but only up to wide Chasma Boreale cuts through polar deposits and ice such as those present at Greenland

Planum Boreum interfaces with Vastitas Borealis west of Chasma Boreale at an irregular scarp named Rupes Tenuis This scarp reaches heights of up to 1km At other places the interface is a collection of mesas and troughs

Planum Boreum is surrounded by large fields of sand dunes spanning from 75N to 85N These dune fields are named Olympia Undae Abalos Undae Siton Undae and Hyperboreae Undae Olympia Undae by far the largest covers from 100E to 240E Abalos Undae covers from 261E to 280E and Hyperboreale Undae spans from 311E to 341E See also List of extraterrestrial dune fields

Planum Boreum is home to a permanent ice cap consisting mainly of water ice with a 1 m thick veneer of carbon dioxide ice during the winter It has a volume of 12 million cubic kilometres and covers an area equivalent to about 15 times the size of Texas It has a radius of 600km The maximum depth of the cap is 3km

The spiral troughs in the ice cap are formed by katabatic winds that entrain surface ice eroded from the equatorfacing sides of the troughs likely aided by solar ablation sublimation which is then redeposited on the colder polefacing slopes The troughs are roughly perpendicular to the wind direction which is shifted by the Coriolis effect leading to the spiral pattern The troughs gradually migrate towards the pole over time the central troughs have moved about 65km in the last 2 million years Chasma Boreale is a canyonlike feature older than the troughs and in contrast is aligned parallel to the wind direction

The surface composition of the northern ice cap in middle spring after a winters accumulation of seasonal dry ice has been studied from orbit The outer edges of the ice cap are contaminated with dust 015 by weight and are mostly water ice As one moves toward the pole the surface water ice content decreases and is replaced by dry ice The purity of the ice also increases At the pole the surface seasonal ice consists of essentially pure dry ice with little dust content and 30 parts per million of water ice

The Phoenix lander launched in 2007 arrived at Mars in May 2008 and successfully landed in the Vastitas Borealis region of the planet on May 25 2008 The north polar cap of Mars has been proposed as a landing site for a human Mars expedition by Geoffrey A Landis and by Charles Cockell

A February 2008 HiRISE observation captured four avalanches in progress off a cliff The cloud of fine material is across and extends from the base of the cliff The reddish layers are known to be rock rich in water ice while the white layers are seasonal carbon dioxide frost The landslide is thought to have originated from the uppermost red layer Followup observations are planned to characterize the nature of the landslide debris

A large doughnutshaped cloud appears in North polar region of Mars around the same time every Martian year and of about the same size It forms in the morning dissipates by the Martian afternoon The outer diameter of the cloud is roughly  and the inner hole or eye is across The cloud is thought to be composed of waterice so it is white in color unlike the more common dust storms

It looks like a cyclonic storm similar to hurricane but it does not rotate The cloud appears during the northern summer and at high latitude Speculation is that this is due to unique climate conditions near the northern pole Cyclonelike storms were first detected during the Viking orbital mapping program but the northern annular cloud is nearly three times larger The cloud has also been detected by various probes and telescopes including the Hubble and Mars Global Surveyor

When Hubble Space Telescope viewed it in 1999 it was thought to be cyclonic storm The diameter was measured to be approximately 1750km and featured an eye 320km in diameter

Republic of Lower Canada
The Republic of Lower Canada was a breakaway state proclaimed in the aftermath of the 1837 Rebellions The defeat of the rebellion meant that the state could never be properly established

A British colony since 1760 Canada was divided in two distinct entities in 1791 Lower Canada mainly inhabited by the descendants of the colonists of New France and Upper Canada mainly inhabited by British colonists and American Loyalists who established themselves as refugees of the American Revolution Each entity had its own elected assembly

The Francophones who were the majority in Lower Canada wished to take into their own hands important decisions regarding the administration of the colony However a massive frustration emerged because the assembly was soon restricted to an aesthetical role the real legislative and executive power was concentrated in the hands of the GovernorGeneral chosen by London who often misunderstood or belittled the interests of the people of Lower Canada which were at times contradictory to those of the British colonial authorities

The unstable political situation lack of individual ministerial responsibility of the colonial government as well as the economic crisis and the recent independence of the United States and of Latin American states led the people of Lower Canada in the autumn of 1837 to the Lower Canada Rebellions The poorly armed untrained and outnumbered Patriotes were quickly defeated by the British Army The survivors sought refuge in the United States

On 2 January 1838 Robert Nelson as well as a good number of refugees such as LouisJoseph Papineau OCallaghan Chartier Rodier Malhiot Ct Bouthillier Davignon and Gagnon assembled at Middlebury in Vermont to plan a military invasion of Lower Canada The Patriotes present voted in favour of the quick establishment of a Provisional Government and launched an attack from the safety of the United States Some voted against this venture such as Papineau who judged it doomed from the start without the help of a military power such as the United States or France This led to some disagreement between the two rebel leaders

The first invasion of Lower Canada was attempted on 28 February 1838 The six to seven hundred rebels led by the two doctors Cot and Nelson left Vermont with the goal of crossing the border They soon arrived at a camp situated approximately 15 kilometers from the border and Robert Nelson was given the rank of General of the Army and elected President of the Republic of Lower Canada Nelson then read the Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada which was very progressive for the time Lower Canada was unilaterally declared an independent Republic and its people declared absolved of all allegiance to the British crown The state laid down enjoyed provisions such as the Separation of Church and State equal rights for all citizens abolition of the feudal seigneurial system abolition of the death penalty liberty of the press and most notably the equality of the French and English languages including official bilingualism

Unfortunately for the rebels they were quickly beaten back by the British army and the American government feeling the British pressure decided to stay neutral not permitting such an invasion to be mounted from their territory Nelson and Cot were arrested at the border and charged for violations of neutrality then released They took this as a lesson in organization and secrecy noting they could never hope to match the British army in open warfare with their small numbers and resources This led to the creation of a guerrilla organization named the Frres chasseurs under the guise of a hunting club with the goal of overthrowing the governments of Upper and Lower Canada and to establish sovereign democratic republican institutions in their place Its organization was hierarchical and was led by a Great Eagle equivalent to a MajorGeneral He led Eagles who each represented a district of the province and led a company The Eagles chose two men as Beavers equivalent to a Captain who in turn each had under their orders 5 Snowshoes Corporals Each of the Snowshoes led 9 men with the title of Hunters It was financed by supporters in Lower Canada and the United States Wild rumours began to roam regarding the numerical strength of the rebels John Colborne spoke of tens of thousands others believed that each parish of Lower Canada had their recruiting office

An insurrection was planned for 3 November 1838 On that day the rebels assembled along the border at Lacolle Napierville and Chateaugay Some impatient groups did not wait for Nelsons orders and began attacking piecemeal At Beauharnois a group occupied a seiugneurie and another seized a steamship to convert it into a warship The initial plan was to seize Beauharnois Chateaugay la Prairie SJean Chambly Boucherville and Sorel Nelson commanding 800 men was to go up the Richelieu valley to capture SJean and advance to Montreal Montreal TroisRivires and Quebec City would be successively attacked drawing upon increasing amounts of manpower and weapons as the population would join them

Nothing went according to plan In Montreal authorities quickly responded and arrested many local leaders Other Patriotes seeing that the promised weapons failed to arrive marched to the Native reservation of Kahnawake to seize the Natives arsenal They failed and many were made prisoner to be delivered to the British An American ship which was to deliver weapons was intercepted by a group of Loyalist volunteers Other weapons which had been hidden at Rouses Point in the United States were seized by American authorities Apprehending that the operation was failing he led his men onwards to Odelltown In Lacolle a rumour said that Nelson had tried to run away during the night only to be caught by his men the doctor convincing them that he was merely inspecting the troops

On 10 November they attacked Odelltown The colonial militia was quickly reinforced and the rebels had to pull back Defeated they retreated to the United States Nelson himself had fled before the battle was over

Later that year Nelson met many leaders of the Patriot movement in Swanton Vermont and began to plan border skirmishes to draw the United States into a conflict with the British Empire However the 1842 WebsterAshburton Treaty destroyed the last hopes of getting American assistance to liberate the French Canadians from British colonialism Ruined destitute and his reputation broken he refused to return to Lower Canada despite an amnesty and stayed in the United States forsaking politics until his death in 1873 in Staten Island

Lower Canada experienced during and after the rebellions great hardships and oppression and exploitation that would last until the Quiet Revolution including a systematic program of assimilation the mandatory use of English in all public matters and business as well as an economic recession The Rebellions lead to many more conflicts most notably the 1845 Rebellion Losses Bill which caused enraged Orangist and Tory Anglophones to Burn the Building of Parliament in Montreal which lead to the construction of Ottawa A large number of people were drawn to the promise of a better life in the United States to form the large majority of the French American community concentrated mostly in the industrial north

The 1837 and 1838 Rebellions received increased interest following the rise of the Quebec independence movement and many of their symbols are used today to represent Qubcois nationalism The 1838 attempt at separation is often overshadowed by the much more violent general insurrection that occurred a year earlier

<doc id="7723586" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7723586" title="Street crime">
Street crime
Street crime is a loose term for any criminal offense in a public place The difference between street crime and whitecollar crime is that street crime is often violence that occurs in a public area whereas whitecollar crime is nonviolent crime conducted by governments or private industries in order to gain financial stability According to Londons Metropolitan Police Force Robbery often called mugging and thefts from victims in the street where their property is snatched and the victim is not assaulted is also considered street crime 

Other examples of street crime include pickpocketing the open illegal drugs trade prostitution in the form of soliciting outside the law the creation of graffiti and vandalism of public property and assaults As a generic term street crime may include all of these as well as offenses against private properties such as the stealing of hub caps

The majority of street crimes as portrayed by various news media are initiated by criminals seeking quick financial gains However they can also be carried out by organized individuals with a common goal of profiteering On the other hand not all of these instances are considered by the FBI to be organized crimes due to the random nature of the crimes themselves 
The term organized crime does not often include organized street crimes

An organized crime is often a major business consisting of many individuals associated for the common goal of criminal profiteering In contrast street crimes are normally conducted by hastily and loosely formed groups of individuals with the common goal of gaining illicit money through immediate criminal acts

In 2016 the government allocated 318 billion on the Justice Department where that money was utilized to incarnate criminals police them and enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States This not only takes a toll on the governments budget but as well as the taxpayers and multiple other organizations where money is being deducted in order to imprison criminals In order to compensate for the increased budget for the Department of Justice often taxes are increased and oftentimes individuals spend money to prevent encountering crime Other factors impact those who are victims of these crimes where they are spending money on medical care property damages and oftentimes loss of a steady income for their families Areas of urban decay characterized by abandoned buildings and cars unkempt vacant lots and broken windows tend to attract the homeless and increasing criminal activity Instead of helping to improve these areas which can be done by communities often time the areas start out with minor offenses but often become major events

A second factor is that increasing public concern about the safety of the streets has generated vigorous demands for more police protection and a growing public recognition of the limited capacity of many police agencies to mount an effective program of crime control and prevention Crime seems to be getting out of hand engulfing new neighborhoods and erupting in riotous assault looting and arson in the central slum areas of the big cities A statistical report that did not show more crime under such conditions would seem puzzling indeed to the ordinary citizen A cyclical pattern has been set in motion where the increasing public readiness to accept an accurate portrayal of the full dimensions of the crime problem meets an increased willingness to supply it As the iceberg of crime rises to the surface of public visibility the need to bring new and more sophisticated resources to bear on the law enforcement task will become increasingly evident 

The sociological impact of crime cause societies to feel unsafe and demand the government protect its people from criminals thus fueling the mass incarceration policy within the United States There has been a steady increase in individuals who have been incarcerated ideally this benefits societies but crime has exponentially increased over the last decade due to fear Because individuals fear to live in communities where small crimes are prevalent often these areas are overlooked and crime rates increase

The motivation for street crimes has been explored by multiple studies including a study cited by Iowa State University where 55 street crime culprits were interviewed in order to determine the social links tied to street culture

After interviewing those who participated in approximately 101 occurrences of street crimes among the principal reasons for these crimes including assault and robbery were determined to be for societal status and recognition and thrill and excitement The cultural viewpoint behind street crimes is built on the foundation that the intention of committing these acts comes from shared societal norms that support and reinforce violence Street crimes are often amplified by the expansion and creation of gangs that propagate and reinforce these types of street culture behaviors

Other factors that lead to street crimes are poverty unemployment and parental neglect Crime rates in areas that are characterized by higher rates of unemployment and poverty are estimated to be greater than other welldeveloped areas There is a greater probability of unemployed adolescents not only being offenders but also victims of violence and street crimes Another underlying cause of street crime stems from parents who deal with more financial or social pressures as they are at a higher risk of practicing poor parental techniques such as insufficient disciplinary actions neglect and ineffective supervision Such parental actions are likely to increase the likelihood of teenage participation in street crimes

Kokudaka
One koku roughly equivalent to five bushels was generally viewed as the equivalent of enough rice to feed one person for a year The actual revenue or income derived holding varied from region to region and depended on the amount of actual control the fief holder held over the territory in question but averaged around 40 percent of the theoretical kokudaka

The amount taxation was not based on the actual quantity of rice harvested but was an estimate based on the total economic yield of the land in question with the value of other crops and produce converted to their equivalent value in terms of rice

The ranking of precedence of the daimy or feudal rulers was determined in part by the kokudaka of the territories under their administration In 1650 the total kokudaka of Japan was assessed at 26 million koku with the Shgun directly controlling 42 million koku

South Yorkshire Junction Railway
The South Yorkshire Junction Railway was a railway which ran from Wrangbrook Junction on the main line of the Hull and Barnsley Railway to near Denaby Main Colliery Village South Yorkshire It was nominally an independent company sponsored by the Denaby and Cadeby Colliery Company but was worked by the Hull and Barnsley Railway

The SYJR received its Act of Parliament on 14 August 1890 and opened for goods traffic on 1 September 1894 and for passengers on 1 December the same year The passenger service lasted less than 9 years the last trains running on 1 February 1903 Intermediate passenger stations were at Sprotborough and Pickburn and Brodsworth

The Hull and Barnsley Railway was absorbed into the North Eastern Railway in 1922 and then to the London and North Eastern Railway at the Grouping

The line was over 11 miles in length with many embankments and cuttings it also had steep uphill grades in the northerly direction at parts including a 1 in 100 rise after Denaby and another steep rise near Wrangbrook 3miles long being between built at a grade of 1 in 100 or 1 in 112 It crossed the Great Northern and Great Central Joint line 25 miles after Wrangbrook junction a short tunnel Cadeby Tunnel was required around 15 miles from the Denaby end being about 250yards long A branch to Brodsworth colliery was added in 1908 from Pickburn

Goods traffic lasted longer than passenger traffic Most of the line including the branch which served Brodsworth Colliery was closed on 7 August 1967

A short stub remained after this date extending northwards from Lowfield Junction the lines southern connection with the Great Central Railways DoncasterSheffield line just west of Conisbrough station This section ran to sidings serving a limestone quarry operated by the Steetley Dolomite company It saw its last main line traffic in July 1975 although it continued to be used as a link by the National Coal Board to transfer traffic between Cadeby Colliery and Denaby Main Colliery where the NCB had wagon repair facilities until the collieries closed in 1986

Clavicipitaceae
The Clavicipitaceae are a family of fungi within the order Hypocreales A 2008 estimate placed 43 genera in the family but recent work has increased this number to 97

Molecular phylogenetic analysis of multigene DNA sequence data indicates the taxon Clavicipitaceae is paraphyletic and consists of three welldefined clades at least one of which is shared with members of another fungal family Hypocreaceae The evolution within the Clavicipitaceae is marked by interkingdom host jumping and the range of this large and heterogeneous fungal group spans mutualistic plant symbionts as well as parasites of plants insects and other fungi

Many of its members produce alkaloids toxic to animals and humans One of its most infamous species is Claviceps purpurea which has historical significance as the cause of St Anthonys fire also known as ergotism Ergotism is caused by ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine and ergocristine which are chemical derivatives of lysergic acid Metarhizium species are widely used in the biological control of insect pests

Several genera especially those previously described as anamorphic having no known sexual cycle are now reclassified into other families in light of recent molecular and other evidence Mycobank currently July 2018 lists the following genera in this family

Mortal Error
Mortal Error The Shot That Killed JFK is a 1992 nonfiction book by Bonar Menninger outlining a theory by sharpshooter gunsmith and ballistics expert Howard Donahue that a Secret Service agent accidentally fired the shot that actually killed President John F Kennedy Mortal Error was published by St Martins Press in hardback paperback and audiobook

Menninger is also the author of And Hell Followed With It Life and Death in a Kansas Tornado which won a Kansas Notable Book Award in 2011

Donahue first became interested in the story of the assassination of John F Kennedy after participating in a recreation of the shooting as one of eleven invited marksmen and sharpshooters He demonstrated that it would have been possible for Lee Harvey Oswald to have fired three shots in the time specified by the Warren Commission and was the only one of the eleven to better the 56second window However the experience highlighted to Donahue other concerns regarding the Warren report and in particular the fact that the testimony of ballistics experts seemed to have been completely omitted from the Commissions evidence gathering

Conducting his own investigation Donahue eventually decided that the bullet that struck Kennedy in the head had in fact been fired by United States Secret Service Special Agent George Warren Hickey Jr March 24 1923 to February 25 2005 from an AR15 rifle carried in the car immediately following the Presidents vehicle The series of events is as follows After the first shot which hit the street was fired Hickey turns completely around and acquires Oswald on the sixth floor of the school book depository building His turned head is documented in an AP photograph by James Altgens Hickey reaches for the AR15 under the seat releases the safety and begins to lift the gun The second shot is fired by Oswald hitting the president and Texas Governor John Connally The presidents car and the followup car containing Hickey suddenly speed up This is attested to by Secret Service agent Clint Hill Agent Hickey who is unstable because he is standing on the cushion of the seat rather than the floor of the car begins to fall back due to the acceleration of the vehicle pulling the trigger of the AR15 The gun is pointed toward Kennedy at that instant and the bullet strikes him squarely in the back of the head

In parallel he believes Oswalds second shot through Kennedys neck may have already critically wounded the president before the third shot was fired

Donahue was encouraged in his investigations by Ralph Reppert a reporter for the Baltimore Sun In 1977 Reppert published Donahues theory in two articles which appeared on Sunday May 1 and the following Sunday with the second article accompanied by an editorial These two men were keen to collaborate on a book on the subject but this was cut short by Repperts ill health and subsequent death Donahue later also approached author John Davis in the hope that a book would still be written The original copyright of Mortal Error read Copyright 1992 Bonar Menninger and Howard Donahue but some later editions did not mention Donahues copyright The Acknowledgements section dated January 21 1992 begins Special thanks to Nick Beltrante for a great news tip the late Ralph Reppert for showing the way Howard and Katie Donahue for casting their lot with me 

Donahues reconstruction of the trajectories of the shots that struck Kennedy and Governor Connally supported the singlebullet theory for the second shot Donahue decided that the impossible trajectory suggested by the Warren Commission was only necessary because there was an error in their positioning of Connally He also concluded that this was Oswalds second shot the first having missed owing to the misalignment of the rifles telescopic sight but with a ricochet fragment slightly wounding Kennedy and that Oswald had not fired a third shot the third cartridge case found at the scene having been a slightly bent and empty one kept in the rifles chamber

Neither Donahue nor Menninger commented on whether the Warren Commissions key finding that Oswald acted alone was correct or not Menninger notes that the theory is consistent with Oswald being involved in a conspiracy The term coverup is mentioned in the book rather than conspiracy

The book takes the overall form of a narrative in which Menninger describes Donahues enquiries over twentyfive years

Chapter 1 A Chance Telephone Call describes the events that led to Donahues interest in the assassination and a brief biography up until that point

Chapters 2 and 3 The Warren Report and The Critics then give the context and summary of the report and a detailed summary of its critics as of 1968

Chapter 4 The Single Bullet Theory presents Donahues analysis of the shot which according to the Warren Commission struck both Kennedy and Connally and suggests that the magic bullet trajectory is only necessary because the estimated position of the Governor was wrong One of Oswalds shots could therefore have caused both mens injuries as claimed but there remain other unanswered questions

Chapter 5 The Head Shot describes Donahues analysis of the shot that hit Kennedy in the head using the Warren Commission evidence particularly the official autopsy report stills from the Zapruder film and other photos and holes drilled in a plaster skull Numerous questions arise surrounding the completeness and even accuracy of the autopsy report

Chapter 6 A Fortuitous Encounter describes Donahues first correspondence with the Secret Service and reviews the conclusions that led to his approaching them

He then by chance meets Dr Russell Fisher who led the Clark Panel which reviewed the autopsy in 1968 and who provides a copy of its report and many insights into details of the autopsy report and problems with the material provided to the panel The suspicion of an accidental discharge by a Secret Service agent grows

Chapter 7 Kennedys Unknown Wound describes Donahues conclusion that Kennedy suffered a scalp wound from a ricochet fragment from Oswalds first shot using the material provided by Fisher This resolves some problems with the timing of the reactions of Kennedy and Connally

Chapter 8 Murphys Law resumes the story of Donahues career as his expertise and reputation as an expert witness grows

Chapter 9 The Discovery describes more of Donahues career and his discovery of a photo showing a Secret Service agent holding a weapon that could have produced the kind of wound Kennedy suffered the photo eventually used on the cover of the book This revives his interest in publishing an article on his findings

Chapter 10 Breaking News describes the first publication of Donahues conclusions in articles by Ralph Reppert and attempts to contact Hickey Questions are asked regarding the nature of the coverup and particularly about whether Robert Kennedy was involved in it

Chapters 11 to 13 describe Donahues experiences with the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations

Chapter 14 The AR15 describes the ill health and death of Reppert the reporter who wrote the articles that broke the story which ends their proposed collaboration on a book on Donahues theory and puts the book proposal on hold The story of the AR15 is told with comparisons to the M1 AK47 M14 and M16 and some very critical assessments of the adoption of the M14 and M16

Chapter 15 The Final Breakthrough presents more ballistics especially estimating the size of the head shot entry wound and its relevance John Davis another possible author for the book is contacted and is at first enthusiastic Howard gives up his Masters studies in forensics but becomes increasingly employed as an expert witness despite this

Chapter 16 Hope Dies Hard gives a brief history of the Secret Service their nightmare assignment guarding Kennedy and their reaction to the shooting There follows Hickeys involvement in the Warren Commission and statements by him and other agents Donahues conversation with one notable conspiracy theorist is also described

Chapter 17 Today is a recap as of spring 1991 describing reactions from Secret Service agents and others to the theory and more attempts to contact Hickey

An afterword headed Note from the Publisher describes more attempts to contact Hickey and to discuss the theory with the Secret Service and others and why the decision to publish the book was taken

There are several appendices

Finally there are chapter by chapter endnotes giving sources and their bibliographic details and an index

Reaction to Mortal Error has been mixed James Balducki of the Associated Press cited that Donahues scrupulousness made his theory of the JFK assassination plausible Balducki praised the book saying Menninger interprets the story with a sharpness and fluidity that never unravels amid the surge of detail David Pietrusza called Donahues theory unusual due to him not tying the assassination to Mafia CIA or FBI but that there were still problems with Donahues theory The Hamilton Spectator criticized Mortal Error as missing the mark

Prepublication orders topped 100000 but the book caused little impact at the time Menninger commented in 2013 that it might be because Donahues theory was equally disliked by both conspiracy theorists and supporters of the Warren Commission

Howard Donahue died in 1999 In The Smoking Gun documentary his daughter Colleen Donahue Lorenzen remembers her father being surprised that his work aroused so little interest

At the time of his death Donahue was working on another book on the same topic

In 2013 Australian journalist and former police detective Colin McLaren published a book and documentary both titled  examining and supporting Donahues theory

Prior to the publication of the book in 1992 both the publisher and the author contacted Hickey to invite his participation in the book and offering him a chance to respond to the allegations In 1995 Hickey sued St Martins Press over the claims made in Mortal Error The suit was eventually dismissed in 1997 on the grounds that Hickey had waited too long after the books initial publication to file against the publisher Hickey refiled suit when the paperback edition was published and later settled with St Martins Press in 1998 on undisclosed terms

Sources state that Hickey died in either 2005 or 2011

Oleg Kuvaev
Oleg Igorevich Kuvaev  born 6 February 1967 is a Russian artist designer and animator

It was Masyanya who brought fame to Oleg Kuvaev Masyanya an amusing and touching heroine of the witty flashanimated series that first appeared in the Russian internet on 20 October 2001 has become nearly a cult figure Oleg Kuvaev started everything on his own he made up the characters and the stories drew the flashanimated cartoons recorded the sound and uploaded the series each of them about 34 minutes long in the Internet

Oleg Igorevich Kuvaev was born on 6 February 1967 in Saint Petersburg Leningrad He studied first at a school specializing in the English language then at school majoring in physics and mathematics Afterwards there were a number of higher institutions including the Leningrad Institute of Aviation InstrumentationAcademy of Arts and service in the Soviet Army Then he changed a lot of professions and places mostly active as a painter and sculptor for more than 10 years till the times of Big Worldwide Web come

From 1987 he was mainly into painting and sculpture and from 1997 he turned to computer graphics Kuvaev worked as a designer in several studios in computer gaming industry as 3D animator and modeler as webdesigner even javaprogrammer in his free time experimenting with various computer technologies including freshly appearing vector animation macromedia flash

In 2001 he founded Multru studio to promote Masyanya At this point it was just ten short roughmade cartoons about hooligan girl from Saint Petersburg But success was unexpectedly explosive This resulted in epidemic masyanization of the whole country which is perhaps the major achievement of Kuvaev Full of fresh indigenous humor sometimes caustic and absurd but still kind at bottom the series about Masyanya appealed to the young generation whose life interests and problems they actually focused on at the same time embodying an alternative to commercial massculture

The crazy popularity of Masyanya made Oleg Kuvaev waste lots of efforts on fighting for the copyright to his own creation between 20032005 Oleg was forced to fight in the forefront of struggling for copyright laws in Russia which was the stronghold of piracy at this time Many Russian companies have illegally made money on Masyanya and what is much worse distorted sometimes the essence of the personage For example Oleg Kuvaev had to apply to court to compel the closing of the shoddy commercial talk show At Masyanyas broadcast at the Russian popmusic TV channel MuzTV that was using this character illegally without permission And finally Oleg and his team has won three such trials on copyright proving that the times are changing

Until quite recently Oleg Kuvaev worked as the artdirector and owner of Multru studio Besides Masyanya the studio has released 3 more animated cartoons series Eji and Petrutchoe Six and a Half and Magazinchik Boe Just like Masyanya they could be downloaded from the internet free of charge and were translated in different TVchannels across Russia Also numerous advertising cartoons illustrations and even radioshows were produced

Masyanya brought the studio about most of the income in merchandize and mobile services The studio received copyright charges from companies that used the brand Ice creams cookies DVDs Tshirts and much more of such stuff with Masyanyas brand now were produced legally Mobile operators were selling pictures videos and ringtones from Masyanya plentiful which brought stable income But in spite of this suddenly in the middle of 2006 Oleg Kuvaev closed all projects he was working on left the studio the city and the country with no response whatsoever

Now he lives in TelAviv Israel All studio projects are closed except his first and favorite  Masyanya To the middle of 2008 there are summary more than 150 episodes of cartoon released And new episodes still appearing made by Oleg Kuvaev himself as in the beginning of the whole story All of them still available on site httpwwwmultru

Java Classloader
The Java Class Loader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine Usually classes are only loaded on demand The Java run time system does not need to know about files and file systems because of classloaders Delegation is an important concept to understand when learning about classloaders

A software library is a collection of related object code
In the Java language libraries are typically packaged in JAR files Libraries can contain objects of different types The most important type of object contained in a Jar file is a Java class A class can be thought of as a named unit of code The class loader is responsible for locating libraries reading their contents and loading the classes contained within the libraries This loading is typically done on demand in that it does not occur until the class is called by the program A class with a given name can only be loaded once by a given classloader

Each Java class must be loaded by a class loader Furthermore Java programs may make use of external libraries that is libraries written and provided by someone other than the author of the program or they may be composed at least in part of a number of libraries

When the JVM is started three class loaders are used

The bootstrap class loader loads the core Java libraries located in the codice1 directory This class loader which is part of the core JVM is written in native code

The extensions class loader loads the code in the extensions directories codice2 or any other directory specified
by the codice3 system property It is implemented by the codice4 class

The system class loader loads code found on codice5 which maps to the codice6 environment variable This is implemented by the codice7 class

The Java class loader is written in Java It is therefore possible to create your own class loader without understanding the finer details of the Java Virtual Machine Every Java class loader has a parent class loader defined when a new class loader is instantiated or set to the virtual machines system default class loader

This makes it possible for example

Java Platform Enterprise Edition Java EE application servers typically load classes from a deployed WAR or EAR archive by a tree of classloaders isolating the application from other applications but sharing classes between deployed modules Socalled servlet containers are typically implemented in terms of multiple classloaders

JAR hell is a term similar to DLL hell used to describe all the various ways in which the classloading process can end up not working Three ways JAR hell can occur are


The OSGi Alliance specified starting as JSR 8 in 1998 a modularity framework that aims to solve JAR hell for current and future VMs in ME SE and EE that is widely adopted Using metadata in the JAR manifest JAR files called bundles are wired on a perpackage basis Bundles can export packages import packages and keep packages private providing the basic constructs of modularity and versioned dependency management

To remedy the JAR hell problems a Java Community Process JSR 277 was initiated in 2005 The resolution Java Platform Module System intended to introduce a new distribution format a modules versioning scheme and a common modules repository similar in purpose to Microsoft NETs Global Assembly Cache In December 2008 Sun announced that JSR 277 was put on hold The Java Module System was later rebooted as project Jigsaw which was included in Java 9
