The Flying Luttenbachers
The Flying Luttenbachers are an American instrumental unit led by multiinstrumentalist  composer  producer Weasel Walter The Luttenbachers have created a body of work focused on musical extremity and dissonance Over the course of the band the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter The music has run a gamut from intense allacoustic free improvisation to complex modernistic rock composition electronic noise to punkinspired jazz Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk death metal free jazz and no wave

The Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago Illinois as a punk jazz trio with Hal Russell tenor and soprano saxophones trumpet Chad Organ tenor saxophone and Weasel Walter drums The band derived their moniker from Russells birthname Harold Luttenbacher Russell left the band in June 1992 and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of the Flying Luttenbachers first 7 record

The band has since featured a frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians including Fred LonbergHolm Kurt Johnson Jeb Bishop Alex Perkolup Mick Barr Ed Rodriguez Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust Arab On Radar Lightning Bolt US Maple Erase Errata Bobby Conn and Wolf Eyes Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland California in 2003 beginning yet another incarnation of the group The live band played their final concert in November 2006 The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of a final studio album recorded solo by Walter

In 2017 the band reformed for a tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening 3 shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn NY on October 1719

Since 1996s Revenge album the Flying Luttenbachers musical output has been underlined by a gradually unravelling storyline concerning the selfobliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities The Void a dark silent spectre detailed on 2004s album of the same name and The Iridescent Behemoth a massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003s complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on a principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes

There were also coup utility and panel van variants introduced in 1951 48 and 1953 FJ respectively These were both based on the Standard although neither were badged this way Collectively the two cars were known as the Holden utility and panel van From March 1957 the sedan utility and panel van body styles were complemented by a new fivedoor station wagon The wagon was marketed as the Station Sedan in both Standard and Special trim levels

The Business sedan was deleted from the Holden lineup in mid1959 during the FC production run leaving just the Standard and Special However in 1962 the Holden Premier was introduced with the EJ series becoming the new flagship with the Special assigned as the midrange Holden This model trio continued until the 1968 HK series The Standard became the Belmont the Special the Kingswood with the Premier staying as is A new extendedlength Brougham also joined the lineup becoming Holdens topline offering

Swedish Modernist poetry
Swedish modernist poetry developed in the 1930s and 1940s Distinguishing features where experimentation within a variety of styles usually free prose without rhymes or metric syllables 

The lead figure of the modernists was Hjalmar Gullberg 18981961 He wrote many mystical and Christianity influenced collections such as Andliga vningar Spiritual Exercises 1932 but continued to develop and published his greatest work gon lppar Eyes Lips in 1959 

Other important modernistic poets were Artur Lundkvist 19061991 Gunnar Ekelf 19071968 Edith Sdergran 18921923 and Harry Martinson 19041978 

Gunnar Ekelf has become described as Swedens first surrealistic poet after he debuted with the poetry collection sent p jorden in 1932 a work was too unconventional to become appreciated But Ekelf moved towards romanticism and got betters reviews for his second poetry collection Dedikationen in 1934 A work that became influential for later Swedish poets was his Frjesng in 1941 a finely expressed blend of romanticism surrealism and the dark clouds of the ongoing World War II

Edith Sdergran did not achieve fame during her lifetime but is today regarded as one of the foremost modernistic poets from the Nordic countries and she has been translated into all major languages Her first poetry collection was Dikter in 1916 but it was her second collection Septemberlyran 1918 that caught the attention of a larger audience It is distinguished by a kind of beauty that had not been seen for a long time Sdergran suffered from tuberculosis which took her life as early as 1923

Harry Martinson had an unparalleled feeling of nature in the spirit of Linnaeus As typical for his generation he wrote with a free prosody not bound by rhymes and syllables A classic work was the autobiographical Flowering Nettles in 1935 His most remarkable work was however Aniara 1956 a story of a spaceship drifting through space

The arguably most famous Swedish poet of the 20th century is otherwise Tomas Transtrmer 19312015 His poetry is distinguished by a Christian mysticism moving on the verge between dream and reality the physical and the metaphysical

Kobyz
The Kobyz  or kylkobyz is an ancient Kazakh string instrument It has two strings made of horsehair The resonating cavity is usually covered with goat leather

Traditionally kobyzes were sacred instruments owned by shamans and bakses traditional spiritual medics According to legends the kobyz and its music could banish evil spirits sicknesses and death 

In the 1930s when the first folk instrument orchestras were established in the Soviet republic of Kazakhstan a new kind of kobyz came into existence It now had four metallic strings and thus became closer to a violin Such a modernized kobyz can be used to play both Kazakh music and the most complicated works of violin literature One of the few western musicians to use the kobyz is Trefor Goronwy
The kyl kyyak Kyrgyz    sometimes spelt kyl kiak and sometimes without the kyl is a stringed musical instrument used in Kyrgyz music The instrument is carved from a single piece of wood typically apricot and typically measures 6070cm It has 2 strings one to provide melody and the other resonance The kyl kyyak is played vertically with a bow and can be played on horseback The strings and bow are normally made from horse hair and many instruments feature a carved horses head This all reflects the importance of the horse in Kyrgyz rural culture

Bowed instruments may have originated in the equestrian cultures of Central Asia an example being the Kobyz Kazakh  or kylkobyz is an ancient Turkic Kazakh string instrument or Mongolian instrument Morin huurTurkic and Mongolian horsemen from Inner Asia were probably the worlds earliest fiddlers Their twostringed upright fiddles were strung with horsehair strings played with horsehair bows and often feature a carved horses head at the end of the neck  The violins violas and cellos we play today and whose bows are still strung with horsehair are a legacy of the nomads3

It is believed that these instruments eventually spread to China India the Byzantine Empire and the Middle East where they developed into instruments such as the erhu in China the rebab in the Middle East the lyra in the Byzantine Empire and the esraj in India The violin in its present form emerged in early 16thCentury Northern Italy where the port towns of Venice and Genoa maintained extensive ties to central Asia through the trade routes of the silk road

The modern European violin evolved from various bowed stringed instruments from the Middle East4 the Byzantine Empire56 It is most likely that the first makers of violins borrowed from three types of current instruments the rebec in use since the 10th century itself derived from the Byzantine lyra7 and the Arabic rebab the Renaissance fiddle and the lira da braccio8 derived5 from the Byzantine lira One of the earliest explicit descriptions of the instrument including its tuning was in the Epitome musical by Jambe de Fer published in Lyon in 15569 By this time the violin had already begun to spread throughout Europe

Gopalakrishnan had researched playing technique and developed particular fingering and bowing disciplines of the Parur style to produce a clarity of sound and speed of delivery His style includes onefinger playing and a thematic development on singlestring octaves

Violinist Yehudi Menuhin said of a Gopalakrishnans playing I have not heard such violin in all my travels How superbly this young Indian is playing our instrument
Shri Gopalakrishnan said when he was receiving his Sangita Kalanidhi award from the Music Academy of Madras My practice is the only secret of my success and then the other secret is my father The practice what I was used to was nearly 1516 hours a day and that was a very tough one where I used to jump suddenly from Carnatic to Hindustani styles while playing Anything any award I receive is just the fruit of my practice

Vyn Jablonka
Vyn Jablonka is a village and municipality in Humenn District in the Preov Region of northeast Slovakia

Vyn Jablonka  i Felsalmd is a village in Slovakia in the Humenne district First time it was mentioned in the List of property of the Lords of Humenne in 1436 From the beginning it was a foresters village what appeared until the present day The fourth period mayor of the village is Emlia opakov 
From the nearly 700 inhabitants 1828  91 houses 678 inhabitants only 50 are now having their living place in Vysna Jablonka 
Once there used to be also a watermill that you can nowadays see at the exposition of folk architecture of the Hummen museum

When the partisans withdrew only two snipers uhajda and Jacko remained A short time afterwards a German tank battalion came through the village and stampeded some horses The two snipers went to catch them While doing that they found four German rangers who were unprepared as they were full of bravado because of the tank battalion 
After capturing the Germans an important piece of information was found out from the feldwebel Otto Vilnes one of the captured German soldiers who said that the 82nd division will take the positions at the Low Beskyds on the 26th of December with the mission to hold the line until the new and fresh 254th infantry division will come

The Partisan Brigade Sergej decided to hold the line from the 82nd division group until the arrival of the Red Army 

On the 26th of December the Germans crossed Vysna Jablonka and at the Lukovsky Slip they were defeated by the Partisans

The villages first Orthodox church was probably built in the 16th century It definitely existed in the 17th century since the first record about the church is from the year 1623 written by the resident priest In folk tales it is said that he stayed in the Potok slum

The presentday church is located in the lower part of the village at the western hill Its construction is dated to the year 1766 In the landlord records from Hummene it was first mentioned in 1880

In the year 1998 the church went to the Grecokatholic Church The orthodox votari had to have their Masses in one room at the local municipal office

Through the efforts of Empress Maria Theresa the Orthodox in this area became united with Rome with the Union of Uzhorod in 1646 Any church built in this village would have been Greek Catholic not Orthodox The church remained Greek Catholic until the Communists outlawed the Greek Catholic Church and forced Orthodoxy on the people The 1869 Census of County Zemplen Administrative Records of the County Zemplen Archive 2 of the County BorsodAbaujZemplen showed that there were 65 households in the village One was Jewish and if I remember correctly one was Roman Catholic all of the rest were Greek Catholic In 1869 there were no Orthodox households or individuals in Vysna Jablonka 

One Roman Catholic is correct He was my maternal great grandfather He came from Poland with his daughter and motherinlaw and joined the Greek Catholic Church

The village is in the northeast of Slovakia among the Low Beskyds of the Laborec Highlands It is situated close to the river Rieka which is 3km ca 14 miles away The municipality lies at an altitude of 385 metres and covers an area of 24832km
The settlement has the highest elevation in the Humenne district The next biggest cities being Humenne Snina and Medzilaborce 32km 25km and 24km away respectively

The village lies in the northern territories of Slovakia The population of animals depends on the situation

Cylon 1978
Cylons are a fictional race of robots in the original Battlestar Galactica TV series They are the primary antagonists of the series and are at war with the Twelve Colonies of humanity The Cylons also appeared in the shortlived 1980 spinoff series Galactica 1980

An updated version of the original Cylon also appears in the reimagined series briefly in a flashback battle sequence in  in handtohand combat with a young William Adama after they had shot each others fighters down and several in the show finale Daybreak on board an old Cylon refuge known as The Colony

The Cylons were created by a reptilian race also called Cylons However the reptilian race died out centuries earlier leaving behind only their race of robots

The Imperious Leader is the leader of the Cylon Alliance and most advanced Cylon model According to the ILSeries Cylon Lucifer the Imperious Leader is an ILSeries Cylon although it does not look like an ILSeries Cylon All of the Imperious Leaders look identical

The Imperious Leader has a third brain and a body shell resembling the reptilian Cylons The original novelization of the pilot episode states that the Imperious Leaders third brain is specifically designed to emulate the human mind solely for the purpose of anticipating human actions Since the novelization however also specifically describes the Cylons as living organic reptilian beings rather than robots it is not clear whether the robot Imperious Leader has a third brain or not The reptilian look of the Imperious Leader suggests the question whether actually all living Cylons have died out

One Imperious Leader was killed at the Battle of Carillon pilot episode His successor was possibly destroyed during the Battle of Gamoray episode The Living Legend Part 2

In the original 197879 series the voices of both the Imperious Leader and Count Iblis are identical having been provided by Patrick Macnee who played Count Iblis on camera In the Galactica 1980 episode Space Croppers the voice of the Imperious Leader was provided by Dennis Haysbert

Although they look much more civilian than centurions ILseries Cylons act as commanders for the military and governors for civilians of the Alliance  They have two brains and a mostly transparent head through which various lights can be seen pulsing They also have a metallic humanoid face with two eye scanners compared to the single eye scanner of the Centurion models and wear clothing fulllength glittering robes Two ILseries Cylons have been featured onscreen both of which have an effete humansounding voice unlike the flat mechanical tones of Centurions They are 

Two additional ILSeries Cylons are shown onscreen on the Cylon capitol of Gamoray during the Imperious Leaders visit which occurred during the episode The Living Legend Part II Lucifer refers to the second Imperious Leader as being upgraded from an ILmodel like himself

Command Centurion are Centurions with gold armor These are the lower commanders for individual military units though they can be responsible for entire Basestars and garrisons The most wellknown Cylon of this model is Commander Vulpa so identified in The Cylon Death Machine Robert Thurstons novelization of The Gun on Ice Planet Zero Their voices are slightly lower pitched than regular Centurions

In the novelization of the original series it is stated that there is an elite class of Command Centurions referred to as First Centurions roughly equivalent to feudal Counts which act as executive officers to the Imperious Leader and are not subordinate to the ILSeries and like the ILseries they were also said to have multiple brains In the TV series these are actually seen on screen though very rarely and are distinguished from other Command Centurions by black bands on their gold armor Vulpa was originally of this class but had been demoted and stationed on ice planet Arcta

Military androids with silver armor Basic Centurions make up the ground forces and pilots of the Alliance military Although Earths Roman Centurions commanded a unit of eighty men Cylon Centurions form the rank and file of the Cylon forces

Centurions are armed with a powerful energy weapon often referred to as a blaster rifle They also have bayonets and swords for close combat and the execution of prisoners

Some Centurions in the series have been given names 

The Cylon Centurions  the type most often depicted in the original Battlestar Galactica  were strikingly similar to the Imperial stormtroopers of Star Wars in fact both were designed by the same concept artist Ralph McQuarrie The similarities were so strong that it was one of the factors that prompted 20th Century Foxs lawsuit for copyright infringement against Universal Studios owners of the Battlestar Galactica copyright However the lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful

Both the gold Command Centurions and the silver Centurions had their voices vocalized with the use of an EMS Vocoder 2000

There is also a unique Cylon with glittering robes with a metallic humanoid face They are seen in the Imperious Leaders delegation to Gamoray in The Living Legend This is evidently some kind of civilian Cylon as Gamoray is said to have a very large community of civilian Cylons though how civilian Cylon society differs from its military is never explored This is the only known kind of civilian Cylons However as they must have had some kind of admission to the reception of the Imperious Leader it can be assumed that they are not typical civilian Cylons they were perhaps members of some kind of aristocracy

The Cylon humanoid is a rather new model probably first built long after the destruction of the Twelve Colonies of the Humans

Although entirely mechanical beneath an artificial skin the humanoid model is in fact an android featuring a superficial human appearance as well as a condescending attitude toward the nonhumanoid Centurions

Two Cylon humanoids are featured in the episode The Night the Cylons Landed of Galactica 1980 one of which is named Andromus

The Cylons are described as a devoted race that spends no time in any idle pursuits and they employ several models but only of necessary spacecraft such as these




In the 1978 Galactica movie and series and the 1980 spinoff the Cylons were created by an extinct reptilian race that were also called Cylons as related by Apollo in the premiere episode In the episode War of the Gods Count Baltar mentions that the reptilian Cylons were ultimately overcome by their own technology particularly after the Imperious Leader was created despite having had a slight error in its programming and recognizes Ibliss voice as that of the Cylon leader and Iblis counters that if that were true it must have been transcribed over a thousand yahren years ago

At the beginning of the series the Cylons are singularly devoted to the destruction of humanity The war started when the Cylon Empire sought to expand into the territory of the Hasaris and the Human Colonies intervened on behalf of the conquered Hasaris Due to those events the Cylon Empire now viewed the entire human race as a target

Cylons are led by the Imperious Leader an ILSeries Cylon elevated to a supreme leadership position over all Cylons All Cylons from the ILseries down typically repeat the phrase By Your Command when responding to any order

The Cylon Empire is also responsible for tributary powers under the aegis of the Cylon Alliance The Ovions an insectoid race enslaved by the Cylons and transported to the planet Carillon for mining purposes are the only known member of the Cylon Alliance shown onscreen Aside from the Ovions and the defeated Hasaris the only other known race conquered by the Cylons are the Delphians which are mentioned to have been exterminated in The Living Legend

Cylon society appears to be almost exclusively military Until the discovery of Gamoray which the Colonial fleet had targeted for its rich fuel reserves no civilian Cylon outpost had ever been seen by anyone


The Berkley book series also explored two other aspects of Cylon design The first is the development of multiple brain status This allows Cylons additional thinking and deductive abilities The second is an unexplained talent for knowing when a human is lying which was suggested in the episode The Lost Warrior

Presented in The Gun on Ice Planet Zero book the second of the two novels written before the network insisted the Cylons become robots their multibrain status is the surgical inclusion of an auxiliary brain allowing for higherlevel thinking abilities The command centurion and garrison commander on planet Tairac Vulpa demonstrated this ability


According to the Maximum Press comic of Battlestar Galactica just prior to the start of The Thousand Yahren War the Cylonss Imperious Leader made a deal with the mysterious and demonic Count Iblis meaning Satan in the Arabic language to betray his entire race in exchange for power that would allow him to become like Count Iblis Count Iblis however having lied about the process of empowerment instead changed the Imperious Leader into a cybernetic entity more machine than organic being Enraged the Imperious Leader swore revenge and became more and more driven by conquest and warfare

In the Maximum Press comic the Cylons were originally led by a ruthless conquest and expansionismdriven emperor named Sobekkta one of the original living Cylons who were a race of intelligent humanoid reptiles

In Battlestar Galactica  16 Berserker During a planetary search Apollo unfortunately comes across a lone Mark III prototype Cylon This advanced Cylon is more creative and adaptive like humans in its strategy making the Mark III more capable to defeat humans However the existing Cylons deemed this advanced Cylon prototype more a threat to them due to its unquenchable megalomania to rule so they marooned him far from the Cylon empire until needed if ever

The Cylons also appear in the official computer game adaptation which is a prequel to both the original and reimagined series

Larami came out with a bubble toy in 1978 called the Battlestar Galactica Cylon Bubble Machine as well as a line of other inexpensive toys

Cylon reimagining
Cylons are a fictional artificiallyintelligent species envisioned in the Battlestar Galactica science fiction series and related franchises Originally created to serve human needs like other machines a series of events involving the transfer of a humans consciousness into a Cylons neural network led Cylons to evolve into sentient selfaware beings The original Cylons were purely mechanical

The Cylon was reimagined in the second Battlestar Galactica television series and its prequel Caprica The first configurations Centurions were robots Others were cyborgs whose different configurations incorporated biological elements including some that were nearly indistinguishable from humans
One of the series core themes is All of this has happened before and will happen again Cylon Centurions were invented twice Once thousands of years before the events of Battlestar Galactica and later they fought a war against the Thirteenth Tribe on Earth

The second Centurion creation is detailed in the prequel series Caprica There they were created by Zoe Graystone and her father Daniel Graystone owner of Graystone Industries

The Caprica Cylon is a combination of programming done by Zoe and Daniels MCPenhanced MetaCognitive Processor Graystone Industries U87 Robot A common activity on Caprica was to participate in a virtual world VWorld that allowed players to live an alternate existence The original Cylon was developed as a place to house Zoes avatar virtual existence after she is killed in a bombing on a maglev train in Caprica Episode 1 Her father sees her avatar in VWorld and forces her best friend Lacy to take him to her there where she explains that she is much more than a simple digital simulation She has Zoes memories from a neural scan Zoe developed to extend a VWorld character into a virtual instance of the person The digital Zoe says to her father I dont feel like a copy and she becomes the basis of the first Cylons

Cylons were originally accepted into Caprican culture as robotic workers after a group of them under direct remote control by Graystone himself with the help of his wife Amanda successfully thwarted an attack on the public at Atlas Stadium by the Soldiers of the One STO The Cylons then spread throughout the colonies as a worker class but because they had basic selfawareness they became increasingly resentful of their servitude

In Battlestar Galactica the Cylons were created thousands of years before the series began They destroyed the Thirteenth Tribe living on the original Earth 2000 years before

BSGr Cylon society consists of three classes biological rulingclass androids pejoratively skinjobs laborwarrior class Centurions and a transportair warrior class Basestars and Raiders Basestars and Raiders are partly biological cyborgs and as such are vulnerable to biological threats such as disease Raiders and Centurions while intelligent were inhibited from exercising free will although the Hybrids that controlled Basestars did exercise some autonomy and were respected by the skinjobs

The skinjobs lead Cylon society Some are sleeper agents programmed with false memories to think they are human Cylons can convincingly interact with humans and are capable of intimate relationships

They have limited superhuman abilities such as increased stamina and strength and the ability to connect with computer systems Cylons are more sensitive than humans to some forms of radiation and more resistant than humans to others They can upload their memories to other copies of their model through a central station Another Cylon of the same model can then access these memories The humanoid Cylons have the ability to distinguish between copies by sight unlike Centurions and humans

Centurions are often called toasters by humans partly a reference to their metallic construction but also to demean them Toaster was also used to derogate skinjob another derogatory term and an homage to the film Blade Runner in which BSGr star Edward James Olmos has a supporting role Centurions were also termed chromejobs or bulletheads The chronological origin of the word toaster can be found in the prequel Caprica episode 10 which was created after BSG had ended After a car crash made the firstever test Cylon inoperable it was considered toast after which Tomas Vergis joked or a toaster The term skinjob is originally used in Caprica episode 17 where a new body is being discussed for an avatar and AI of Zoe The parents emphasize it will be with skin as opposed to the Cylon metal prototypes which she then calls a skinjob

Cylons were initially unable to produce children with each other They turned their attention to mating with humans Their crossbreeding experiments in facilities called farms are unsuccessful They theorize that love is necessary for them to procreate because God is love in their theology This leads to a successful experiment in which an Eight and a human Karl Agathon fall in love and produce a daughter named Hera

Skinjobs can download their consciousness into another body when the body they are using dies giving them virtual immortality These downloads have a limited range requiring the Cylons to build a Resurrection Ship to capture them If not within range of a Resurrection Ship downloading is unavailable and a Cylons death is permanent The downloading process is shared by the semiorganic Raider spacecraft which allows Raiders who have been killed several times to become more formidable fighters Scar The Centurions do not download Resurrection Ships function as boosters for the central Resurrection Hub Without the Hub resurrection is not possible

This technology was first shown in Caprica in an attempt to resurrect deceased relatives in a socalled resurrection program first called that way in episode 13 in virtual reality where one could meet and interact with those one was mourning for

Cylons have an ability referred to as projection a form of realistic daydreaming that allows them to change the appearance of their surroundings in their own mind eg making the corridors of a ship look like a forest etc They have the ability to touch smell etc the fantasy environment They can share projections and create virtual individuals as part of the fantasy This ability allows them to express their subconscious desires

If a Cylon is deemed dangerous by the other models he or she may be boxed  deactivated with consciousness and memories placed in storage This may involve a particular copy or an entire line Boxed consciousnesses are stored in the Resurrection Hub and can be unboxed The term was also used in the prequel Caprica episode 10 which discusses boxing a defunct test cylon as literally placing it in a crate for deep storage As Caprica is the prequel this is chronologically the first time of its use from which the Cylons derived their own definition

Between 34000 years before the Second Cylon War it is implied that the humans and Cylons of Kobol fought each other but the nature of the conflict remains unrevealed The Thirteenth Tribe were Cylons who fled Kobol and settled on a planet they dubbed Earth Eventually they developed the ability to reproduce sexually Resurrection technology fell into disuse and was lost The Final Five redeveloped resurrection following warnings by mysterious angels that a Kobollike disaster was coming When life on Cylon Earth was destroyed in a nuclear war between the thirteenth tribe and their mechanical Cylon creations stemming from the latters maltreatment at the hands of the Tribe the Final Five downloaded into an orbiting vessel

The Final Five wanted to warn the other Twelve Colonies to treat their Cylon workers well to prevent another catastrophe However without faster than light FTL travel they required approximately 2000 years to make the journey relative to human time while only a few years passed inside the ship due to Special Relativity When they arrived the Twelve Colonies Cylon Centurions had revolted and the first Cylon War was raging It lasted roughly twelve and a half years

The Final Five learned that these Centurions were trying to develop organic bodies through experiments on humans resulting in the first Hybrid To end the war the Final Five helped the Centurions develop skinjob model numbers One to Eight model number Sevens creation was sabotaged by One and resurrection technology The war ended with an armistice and an attempt by the Colonies to establish diplomatic relations between the parties Instead the Cylons disappeared for forty years

The first of the Colonial skinjobs One John Cavil refused to let the Final Fives concern for humanity blind them He boxed the Final Five He then periodically sent them to the Colonies to see how terrible humanity was

After forty years the Colonial Admiralty sent Battlestar Valkyrie on a covert mission close to the armistice line to gather intelligence on Cylon activity A stealth ship from the Valkyrie crossed the armistice line but was intercepted by the Cylons Three years later the Cylons initiated a surprise attack on the Colonies The attack was successful because a Cylon agent later known as Caprica Six infiltrated Capricas colonial defense network with the unwitting complicity of renowned scientist Gaius Baltar and created backdoor programs to shut down the network and its defenses The attacks wiped out billions of humans nearly the entire colonial population Two Battlestars  Galactica and Pegasus  survived A fleet of civilian ships was scattered throughout the neighboring space Together they fled into deep space

The Cylons pursued them while initiating the next phase of their evolution procreation Female human survivors were detained and used in experiments to create Cylonhuman hybrids The experiments were unsuccessful leading the Cylons to conclude that the missing component was love They tested this by using an Eight posing as Lt Sharon Boomer Valerii from Galactica to seduce a marooned Galactica officer Lt Karl Helo Agathon on Caprica They fell in love The Eight abandoned the Cylons helping Helo to escape The couple later produced the first viable humanCylon birth This Eight joined the fleet with Helo She later married Helo joined the Colonial military and received the call sign Athena

Ten months after the initial attacks Eight Sharon Valerii call sign Boomer attempted to assassinate Commander Adama under the influence of unexplained programing unknown to her She was unaware that she was a Cylon before the attack though she had been uneasy because of unexplained blackouts during various attempts to sabotage Galactica A vengeful crew mate Cally Henderson killed her She downloaded into a new body and settled on Cylonoccupied Caprica in her former apartment unable to relinquish her human identity She led a campaign for better treatment of the humans She and other likeminded Cylons influenced the Cylon civilization which withdrew from the colonial home worlds and pursued benevolent treatment of the humans and then reconciliation

During this time the halfhuman halfCylon hybrid Hera Agathon was born on Galactica Fearing that the Cylons might capture the child President Laura Roslin faked Heras death and secretly had her adopted by a human woman

The humans settled on a barren planet they dubbed New Caprica The refuge lasted a year before the Cylons found them The Cylons occupied the new human settlement at first peacefully but later forcefully and more viciously as the human Resistance increased In the end they used punitive methods to keep the humans in line including summary executions and infiltration by seemingly sympathetic Cylons One such infiltrator was an Eight model who manipulated Felix Gaeta into giving her a list of people the Resistance desired to free from Cylon detention whom she then had executed

Four months later the colonials escaped with the help of a resistance movement and the efforts of both the Galactica and Pegasus The escape required Athenas help She entered the Cylon facility and took the keys to the various Colonial landing craft Prior to this a Three found out from a human oracle that Hera was alive and on the planet She rescued Hera after her adoptive mother was killed during the escape The Pegasus sacrificed itself to save the crippled Galactica but the crew survived joining Galactica

The Cylons then adopted the colonials mission to find the home of the Thirteenth Tribe a planet they called Earth intending to settle there They resumed pursuit of the fleet but upon reaching the Lions Head Nebula dispatched a Basestar to investigate The Basestar took on board a canister left by the Thirteenth Tribe The canister contained an airborne virus that proved deadly to the Cylons The virus persisted through the download process so the Basestar that had been dispatched for the investigation was abandoned to avoid contamination The colonial fleet discovered the Basestar and captured the ailing Cylons The colonial fleets attempt to use the virus to wipe out the Cylons was defeated when Helo repulsed by the strategy had the captive Cylons killed while out of range of a resurrection ship

Meanwhile Boomer turned increasingly antihuman She was charged with Heras care but Hera rejected her During a truce negotiation Boomer told Athena that her daughter was alive but sick on the Baseship She invited Athena to come to the Baseship and rejoin her people because the occupation showed that humans and Cylons were incompatible and that humans would never truly accept her Later desperate for her child Athena convinced Helo to kill her so she could resurrect on the Baseship Once there she retrieved Hera with the help of Caprica Six who killed a hatefilled Boomer to prevent her from killing the child She had tried to prevent Athena from taking Hera to the humans and declared that Cylons were never meant to have children Caprica Six returned with Athena and was detained by Adama in Athenas old cell

As the pursuit continued internal relations among the Cylons began to break down A Three violated her programming by actively seeking information about the Final Five seeing a vision of them on the Algae Planet where the Colonials stopped to get food From that she was able to identify them She and her twins were then boxed Within the fleet a musical activation signal a version of All Along the Watchtower was received by the Final Five awakening their memories and bringing them together Two were Galactica crew members Saul Tigh and Galen Tyrol while Samuel Anders was an athlete and Tory Foster a political operative They kept their discovery secret Tigh and Anders remained loyal to the humans willing to fight and possibly die for them Tyrol and Foster were ambivalent with Tyrol having prohuman leanings Foster became increasingly antihuman murdering Tyrols wife without remorse after she learned the truth about their identities After their realization the fleet came under attack but during the battle a Cylon Raider identified Anders and he and his fellow Raiders broke off the attack refusing to fight

This set off a debate in the Cylon government regarding the Raiders Ones Fours and Fives voted to lobotomize the Raiders to make them acquiescent Twos Sixes and Eights led principally by a Six named Natalie became convinced that the Raiders had sensed the presence of the Final Five The tie was broken by the unprecedented event of Boomer voting against the rest of her models to side with the Ones Fours and Fives Natalie objected to Cavils actions and removed inhibitor circuitry from the Centurions granting them free will and independent thought The Centurions then killed the models who were lobotomizing the Raiders

In response Cavil lured Natalie and her forces into a trap beyond resurrection range and slaughtered them Only Natalies crippled Basestar survived With her Raiders destroyed except for some Heavy Raiders and the surviving Twos Sixes and Eights minus Boomer Natalie allowed Two Leoben Conoy to locate Kara Thrace and ally with the humans A deal was struck the humans would help the rebels unbox the Threes so that they could identify the Final Five and the rebels would lead the humans to the Resurrection Hub and help them destroy it so Cavil would lose resurrection forever The humans transferred half of their Vipers to the Rebel Basestar Fearing for Hera Athena murdered Natalie causing the Hybrid to jump the Rebel Basestar with Roslin on board away before everyone was ready The Hybrid took the Basestar to the Hub where the allies had the human Vipers towed into battle by Cylon Heavy Raiders so they could catch the Cylons by surprise The plan worked and the Hubs FTL drive was taken out stranding it While the Rebel Basestar engaged two other Basestars Helo and an Eight boarded the Hub to unbox DAnna and found her already unboxed by Cavil and Boomer The three escaped and the Vipers nuked the Hub destroying it and Cylon resurrection capability

After a standoff the identities of the four Cylons in the human fleet were revealed and together they found the devastated Earth a nuclear wasteland There Tigh Anders Foster and Tyrol got flashes of their life on Earth and Tigh learned the identity of the fifth member his dead wife Ellen The humans and rebel Cylons minus DAnna abandoned Earth in search of a new home together The humans and Cylons ended up striking a deal in return for joining the fleet as full members the rebels would upgrade the fleets FTL drives with Cylon technology increasing their jump distance by at least three times This led to a political coup and failed mutiny but left Anders seriously injured although with his true memories returned as the accompanying brain damage broke the mental blocks Cavil had placed on his original identity After telling the others as much as he could Anders slipped into a coma from which he partially emerged while acting as Galacticas hybrid

Cavil revealed that he had a resurrected Ellen Tigh as his prisoner ever since her download after she was killed on New Caprica Her resurrection restored her true memories although her only company was Cavil and Boomer whom hed let in on the secret After Cavil planned to dissect her brain to try to regain resurrection technology Boomer helped Ellen escape to the fleet as part of a plan to kidnap Hera so the Cylons could study her

Galactica and some of the rebel Cylons assaulted the Cylon space station that was the Cylon homeworld to rescue Hera while the Rebel Basestar protected the fleet During the battle Boomer who had begun to feel remorse for kidnapping Hera killed the Four that was starting to dissect the child and carried her back to her parents Athena then killed Boomer The rescue team returned to Galactica where Cavil led a Centurion assault but was defeated He took Hera hostage but was convinced to create a permanent peace with the humans in exchange for the Final Five giving him resurrection technology

Tyrol learns that Foster murdered Cally and breaks the download causing the Cylons to attack again Cavil kills himself An unmanned Raptor is struck by an asteroid causing the dead pilot Racetrack to fire eight nuclear missiles into the Colony knocking it out of orbit and into a black hole destroying it and every remaining One Four and Five Galactica jumps away and arrives at a habitable planet The humans and rebel Cylons settle there while the rebel Centurions are given their freedom and the Rebel Basestar to find their own destiny Anders flies the human fleet and all its technology into the Sun 150000 years later it is revealed that the planet they settled on is our Earth while Hera was Mitochondrial Eve which means all modern humans are partly descended from the humanoid Cylons

The Cylon Centurion is a mechanical infantry model made less intelligent than human models BSGr Centurions retain the silver appearance robotic body helmetlike head and oscillating red bar eye of their forbearers but are larger taller stronger more agile and have a more streamlined appearance They also have retractable guns built into their lower arms bladed fingertips and heavy armour

The Centurions were monotheists who believed in a single loving God

The first colonial Centurion is seen and is identified as a Cybernetic Lifeform Node Built on contract for the Caprican Defense Ministry the Cylons are to replace human warriors on the battlefield Caprica pilot

The U87 prototype Cylon contains a copy of the consciousness of Daniel Graystones daughter Zoe Graystone Daniel Graystone conceives of the Cylons as a slave race and demonstrates this by instructing the prototype to rip her own arm off After catching it interacting with the family dog he realises that the prototype contains Zoes consciousness and attempts without success to force her to admit her identity She is able to defeat the tests he attempts and convinces him that she is just a robot Upon learning that Graystone is about to erase her memory she escapes

The Battlestar Galactica miniseries displays an original model Centurion on display in Galacticanowikinowikis museum hangar The original Centurion is also depicted in a diagram reviewed by the armistice officer in the opening scene

In  Centurions are almost identical to those from the original series except they are rendered using CGI and have exposed joints The Centurion in the museum hangar is retconned as a CGI version with exposed joints Initialmodel Centurions are among those seen defending the Cylon colony from an assault by Colonial and rebel Cylon forces Part 2 of Daybreak

The body had synthetic skin although this model was still primitive and was mechanical rather than biological

Centurions do not download into new bodies when they are destroyed according to screenwriter Ronald D Moore The Hybrids have something to do with the programming of the Centurions When the virus infected the Hybrid on the infected Basestar the Centurions shut down Torn However Centurions can function independently when no Basestars or skinjobs are nearby A Centurion immediately fires upon an Eight when she unplugs a Hybrid Faith It is unclear whether this was in willful defiance of the Hybrid or as a result of the removal of their higher function inhibitor modules Six of One

After the inhibitor modules that restrict higher functions granting them independent thought were removed although still largely servile the Centurions were shown to exhibit humanlike behaviour such as politeness and consideration eg responding to please

These Centurions are taller than their predecessors and are sleeker They possess less of a humanoid structure averaging a head taller than humans They retain the bipedal structure of the first model as well as rough hands and feet The feet of the new Centurions are a simple twotoed form that produces a distinctive sound when they walk as the toes move and touch the ground They retain the distinctive oscillating red eye as well as a rudimentary mouth even though they cannot speak The hands are much thinner and visibly segmented and more clawlike they can cut flesh and mortally wound a human making them effective closecombat weapons These claws can be modified at will to a more fingerlike digit or less of a razorsharp weapon

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this model is the twin cannons built into each hand mounted on the side that can be deployed by retracting the hands It was originally established that the Centurions could not move while firing their cannons however in later seasons they were seen to walk and even run while firing The Centurions carry heavy weapons such as antiaircraft rockets that are strapped to their backs for missions where their cannons are not enough Most Centurions can be destroyed or at least damaged by smallarms fire however most require substantial artillery or special rounds to be destroyed a Centurions party that boarded Galactica were especially strong and required explosive rounds to be destroyed as regular rounds proved completely ineffective

These Centurions greatly outmatched the previous model They were betterarmoured stronger and carried internal weapons as opposed to their predecessors who needed to carry weapons such as rifles and pistols like their human creators

The later form of Cylon Raiders are biomechanical entities integrated into small fighter spacecraft They resurrect when they die Raiders are subservient and were compared to trained animals by the humanoid Cylons A Raider nicknamed Scar developed a personality Scar Scar was the Cylons top gun driven by a bitter hatred of humans He was killed and reborn many times Raiders do not use vocal communication appearing to communicate through unspecified electronic signals Modern Raiders unlike their predecessors in the First Cylon War are alive with a complex system of veins organs and biological fluids contained within their main body The Raiders are programmed but began with some measure of autonomy and personality When one Raider saw a Final Five in the human fleet during an attack it retreated leading the remaining Raiders back to the Basestar The Raiders then refused to fight the humans for fear of harming their Cylon kin This led to the lobotomy vote

Welltrained Colonial pilots even nuggets can beat a Raider in most situations The Raiders primary advantage seemed to be in their massive numbers while Galactica carries around 40 Vipers Cylon Basestars support 300600 Raiders The Raiders are maneuverable once described by Kara as a squirmy son of a bitch and most human pilots were unable to keep them in sight for more than a few seconds

The Raiders primary weapons are two kinetic energy guns mounted on the underside of their wings close to the main body They may carry conventional missiles and tactical nuclear weapons Raiders by revealing their red eye can transmit deadly computer viruses or signals to enemy ships which strike with brutal efficiency and can shut down Colonial vessels turning off their power and making them easy prey If all else fails Raiders sometimes attempt suicide attacks A single Raider can destroy a sizeable transport

The Raiders from the First Cylon War were larger spacecraft driven by Centurion pilots and not alive These are used by the remaining First War Centurions guarding the Original Hybrid and the Cylon Colony and later became obsolete

The later Cylon Raiders are different from Cylon Heavy Raiders Like the raiders of the First Cylon War the Heavy Raiders are transports and attack bombers and are primarily piloted by Sixes and Eights

Although they made only a single appearance in the original continuity the episode The Night the Cylons Landed from Galactica 1980 humanoid Cylons are the focus of the reimagining They are usually known as the Cylons or derogatorily as skinjobs or toasters Skinjobs are indistinguishable from humans due to their creation through synthetic biology employing real bones flesh and blood rather than metal but still possess a digital molecular structure Some are programmed to believe that they are organic until otherwise informed

The Cylons can communicate nonverbally but do not have a hive mind even among a single model and are most often shown talking to one another

The thirteen distinct humanoid models are divided into the Final Five that originated on Earth and Significant Seven the latter term is only used by the Battlestar Galactica producers The Final Five are unique and are the last survivors of the Thirteenth Tribe They developed the Seven originally eight in conjunction with the Centurions of the Twelve Colonies Each copy shares biology and general personality throughout their model but they develop into distinct individuals The Final Five showed the Centurions how to make skinjobs and attempted to give them human characteristics love mercy thinking that these characteristics would prevent war 

Prior to the Final Five arriving to stop the first Cylon War on Caprica the Centurions had already made their first humanoid called the Hybrid for the purpose of controlling the baseship Once the Final Five arrived on Caprica they transferred their technology to the Centurions and gave them eight fully humanoid models created by them

Cylon society is made up of the seven whose types are numbered One Two Three Four Five Six and Eight The extinct Seven model the Daniel series was destroyed by a One decades prior to the Colonies destruction

As revealed towards the end of season 4 there is a 2000 year gap between the exodus of the first humanoid Cylons the Final Five from the destruction of life on Earth due to a robot Centurion war there and their arrival at Caprica in the middle of the Caprican robot Centurion war Originally the Final Five had left Earth both to seek a new home and to warn the other Twelve Colonies about the dangers of mistreating Centurions so that they might avoid the fate of Earth However at the time FTL faster than light starship jumping technology was unknown so they made the journey using slower than light technology resurrecting themselves when their bodies wore out over the span of 2000 years 

It should be noted that when the Earth was nuked 2000 years prior the Final Five Cylons had already planned for this event and were resurrected onto their baseship in orbit when their bodies were destroyed in a global nuclear attack that wiped out all life on Earth This resurrection was the event which triggered the Final Five Cylons to begin their 2000 year journey to Caprica only to find out upon arrival that humans and Centurion robots had begun fighting towards extinction just as they had 2000 years prior on Earth

The Final Five arrived at Caprica to discover that the Caprican Centurions had already begun experimenting with creating humanoid Cylons by creating the first Hybrid to control their baseship As part of the agreement to end the war with humans the Final Five Cylons gave the Caprican Centurions eight humanoid Cylon models and a resurrection ship 

During the 40year gap between the end of the first Cylon war and the second Cylon war on Caprica Cavil model number One of the eight humanoid Cylons that the Final Five had designed and created rebelled against the Final Five and took command of the Centurions and of the other humanoid Cylons In order to get rid of the Final Five who blocked him from continuing the Cylon war he tricked the Final Five into to living on Caprica with their memories erased and false memories implanted He was deluded into believing that he could show the Final Five that they were wrong about humans by letting them suffer with the humans as their civilization was destroyed as a result of him restarting the Cylon war and then restoring their memories while resurrecting them on the Cylon baseship Cavil thought this lesson would help the Final Five realize that humans were flawed creatures and thus persuade them to take his side

Ellen the original creator of the eight humanoid models programmed them with a belief in a single allloving God She did this because she wanted the Cylons to know love and to be peaceful and to avoid war in the future However Cavil rejected his programming of believing in God Other Cylons particularly the DAnna model justified attacking the humans perhaps as a form of religious fundamentalism with the goal of remaking the world as a Cylon OneGod utopia

In addition Cavil regarded the creation of humanoid Cylons as a mistake and believed that Cylons should return to a purely mechanical form so that they could experience the world in ways not limited by human senses For example he said that when a star explodes into a supernova he wants to see the Xrays and gamma rays with his eyes and not be limited by biological human eyes 

Cavil was fearful of the mechanical Centurions rejecting the secret removal of circuitry to prevent the Centurions from having free will in Season 4 When Centurions on one of the Cylon baseships received this modification and thus developed free will they revolted against Cavil because they rejected his policy of removing the biological brains of the Raider ships and returning them to a purely mechanical form so that they would follow orders without emotion interfering This small rebellion left the Twos Sixes and Eights in charge of one of the baseships in the Cylon fleet The rebel baseship later forms an alliance with the human fleet after being attacked by Cavils Cylon fleet and left to drift in space without FTL propulsion

The skinjobs are responsible for command decisions While the command structure has not been fully explored some hints at organization are known At the end of the miniseries a group of skinjobs debate what to do and one speaks authoritatively to which another responds by your command a reference to the original series They can freely impose blocks on the behavior and cognitive programming of Centurions Raiders and Hybrids Multiple skinjobs with blocked memories are spread among the surviving humans including members of Galacticas crew

A Cylon council made up of multiple copies of several models appears to cast votes collectively by model indicating that model plays an important role in the structure of Cylon society Precipice Some models are implied to have higher or lower ranks than others During the occupation of New Caprica a select group of individuals who mostly had been within the Colonies such as Boomer and Caprica Six seemed to have seniority within their model One of each model was seen deliberating and discussing their course of action with each of the senior copies representing the opinion of their model

Although little is known about Cylon psychology it is clear that they share many human emotional vulnerabilities This is evidenced by Ginas catatonic state as a result of the severe trauma of her abuse at the hands of the Pegasus crew This abuse was presented in the form of multiple sexual assaults battery starvation and outright torture SixCaprica Six also revealed that Cylons exist by projecting an environment of their choice on the realphysical world

Ones subvert consensus by undertaking many actions without the knowledge or consent of their siblings such as turning against the Sevens and the Final Five and then reprogramming their siblings to hide this

The main antagonist of the series John Cavil initially poses as a priest Lay Down Your Burdens His true identity is revealed when a second copy boards Galactica and reveals his Cylon nature Cavils role in society is contradictory He occasionally serves as a devils advocate pointing out the absurdity of his fellow Cylons and their religious zealotry He was revealed to be a One Six of One

Cavil has a sadistic Machiavellian streak that none of the other Cylon models share He tortured Saul Tigh by gouging out one of his eyes and showing it to him He took pleasure in blackmailing Ellen Tigh into providing sexual favours in exchange for releasing Saul from captivity on New Caprica

Cavil is an atheist alone among the seven models and often mockingly uses air quotes when saying the word God His opinions of humans are contradictory He is one of the most violently antihuman Cylon models advocating a policy of culling humanity down to a controllable number He claimed to have been against the destruction of the Twelve Colonies and advocates a unique Cylon Society not one that emulates its creators After arranging Tighs release Cavil further manipulated the situation by again blackmailing Ellen to betray the human resistance on New Caprica and threatening to kill Saul if she did not comply

Cavil is aloof compared to the other models though Boomer implies that Cavil has begun teaching her his views that Cylons should not emulate humanity Cavil knows aspects of Cylon lore that the others models do not His knowledge of the Final Five led him to box the DAnna and the other Threes to ensure that whatever she had learned about the Final Five stayed hidden

He was made in Ellens fathers image Ellen also named him John He hates this name and shows deep resentment towards Ellen at being limited by having to live in a humanoid body

One was the first model and helped the Final Five create the other seven Therefore Ones knew about the Final Five while the others knew only that they existed For an unstated reason Cavil rejected the human trait of mercy and turned against the Final Five

When the Final Five were resurrected Cavil implants new memories for their life in the Twelve Colonies He also alters the original programming of the seven other models so that searching for talking about and even thinking about the Final Five was strictly forbidden

Ones are played by Dean Stockwell

Leoben first appears as a smuggler at the munitions depot at Ragnar Anchorage where he was exposed as a Cylon miniseries Twos are religious zealots carrying a pathological and sometimes sexual obsession with Starbuck His Cylon identity was revealed Six of One

Twos are skilled at deceit Conoy manipulates Starbuck into thinking that a young girl he had kidnapped on New Caprica is her biological daughter Twos display cunning minds and the ability to find and exploit others weaknesses Unlike other Cylons Twos appear to be prescient and on several occasions prophesy future events

Twos are played by Callum Keith Rennie

DAnna Biers was a reporter for the Fleet News Service Roslin and Adama grant Biers access to all areas of Galactica to investigate her suspicions of a military coverup surrounding civilian deaths aboard the Gideon Their belief is that Biers will discover that military personnel deal with the same pressures and fears as the rest of the fleet and that the events were a tragic mistake The Biers model used the documentary as a means to relay information that Sharon was alive to Cylons on Caprica Final Cut DAnna was revealed to be a Three in the episode Downloaded

Threes are among the more aggressive models and share a fatalistic understanding of the Cylon religion believing that everything that happens is the will of God Their religious devotion masks a deep questioning by Threes about why God allows bad things to happen Theodicy

Threes possess an alphafemale aggressiveness advancing themselves as de facto leaders in any situation They are often rivals of Ones and Sixes The rivalry with the Sixes partly stems from when CapricaSix killed a Three to save Samuel Anders from torture and death DAnna and CapricaSix later reconcile and both of them are involved in a relationship with Baltar Baltar seduces DAnna by exploring her crisis of faith which leads to her secretly committing suicide a major Cylon taboo to experience resurrection She feels these neardeath experiences will answer questions regarding her faith notably the identity of the Final Five DAnna eventually sees the faces of the Final Five Rapture Unfortunately as she does so the other Cylons vote to box all Threes Cavil tells her that what she had seen regarding the Final Five was unacceptable and that her memories would be kept in cold storage DAnna but not the other Threes is later unboxed The Hub

Threes are among the more antihuman Cylons DAnna tells Baltar that she believes that humanity must die to prevent future generations of humans from seeking revenge Exodus Part II She is temporarily the leader of the rebel faction of Cylons that makes peace with the human fleet but when the first Earth is found to be a devastated ruin she decides to stay there and die rather than continuing the cycle of death exodus and rebirth

Threes are played by Lucy Lawless

ONeill poses as a human physician who treats Starbuck for a gunshot wound in what was supposedly a resistance hospital on Caprica The Farm In reality this was a Cylon farm set up to breed humanCylon hybrids using captured humans Simon performed invasive tests on Starbucks reproductive organs He was revealed to be the 4th model in the episode Six of One Fours are consistently medical specialists

Another Four poses as a married man in the Colonial Fleet Cavil at one point asks Simon to leave his life behind and destroy the ship he lives on He defies this order to protect his wife and her child by committing suicide and flying out of an air lock He was not close enough to a Resurrection Ship and therefore died permanently 

Fours are played by Rick Worthy

Doral debuts as a public relations worker for the abortive Galactica museum miniseries Another Five sneaks aboard the Galactica and detonates an explosive Litmus This event prompts the fleetwide announcement that Cylons can have a human appearance He was revealed to be the 5th model in the episode Downloaded

During the Occupation of New Caprica the Fives are antihuman and aggressive They specialize in public relations and control using largescale events and media manipulation

Fives are played by Matthew Bennett

The first model explicitly revealed to be a Cylon in the miniseries Sixes often use seduction to their advantage Important copies include Shelly Godfrey Gina Inviere Head Six Caprica Six and Natalie

One of the Sixes later known as Caprica Six on her way to meet with Baltar murders an infant by breaking its neck This could either be considered sociopathic or a mercy killing due to the coming Cylon attack She saves Baltars life when his house was struck by a blast wave from the Cylon attack

Caprica Six has a lovehate relationship with Baltar alternately defending him to other Cylon models or leaving him to suffer at their hands

A reincarnation of Caprica Six commits the first incident of CylononCylon violence killing a Three with a rock to save Anders life

Caprica Six was imprisoned on Galactica after helping Athena escape from the Cylons with Hera She offers to testify against Baltar While in the brig she has a relationship with Saul Tigh that results in the first CylonCylon pregnancy in 2000 years which ends in a miscarriage

Caprica Six has an Inner Baltar which only she sees similar to how Baltar has an Inner Six that only he can see Inner Baltar serves as a sort of conscience for Caprica Six and as an advisor in times of trouble as Inner Six does for him Inner Baltar appears at least once to Baltar himself Before their true nature is revealed speculation rises that Baltar is a Cylon Inner Baltar and Inner Six appear to Baltar and Caprica Six  all four sharing a moment together  as the first part of the revelation that the Inners are divine beings referred to as Angels manipulating both the Colonials and Cylons into fulfilling Gods plan series finale

Godfrey was on Galactica after the Cylon attack She accused Baltar of treasonously sabotaging human defenses and therefore of killing several million people Six Degrees of Separation She also appears in  TV movie

Gina acted as a contractor for Pegasus and was in a relationship with Admiral Cain When Cain discovered that Gina was a Cylon agent she ordered her crew to push her programming in an attempt to see if Gina was vulnerable to emotional trauma Gina later escaped with Baltars aid assassinated Cain and founded a resistance group in the fleet preaching peace with the Cylons While it seemed that Gina developed feelings for Baltar and wanted to pursue him she detonated a nuclear warhead provided by Baltar that destroyed Cloud Nine other fleet ships and generated an electromagnetic signature the detection of which ultimately led the Cylon fleet to New Caprica

Other important Sixes include Natalie who originally leads the rebel Cylon faction against Cavils faction before she is killed by Athena in a misunderstanding and Sonja who was elected to represent the rebel Cylons in the Colonial fleets Quorum of Ships Captains

Sixes are played by Tricia Helfer

Daniel was the seventh Cylon model No Exit Ellen refers to Daniel as an artist and so sensitive to the world She was very close to Daniel which enraged Cavil he felt that Daniel was Ellens favorite and became jealous Cavil poisoned the amniotic fluid used to mature the Daniel copies and then corrupted Daniels genetic code This sabotage meant that no further Sevens could be created The original was also killed with Samuel Anders stating at one point that Daniel died after regaining his true memories 

Fans speculated that Starbuck or her father was a version of the corrupted Seven line Instead Daniel is merely a plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on Cavils character noting that Daniel is essentially the Abel to Cavils Cain The Sevens were a springboard for Caprica where Daniel Graystone is the name of a main character played by Eric Stoltz this Daniel is the creator of the Colonial Centurions

Sevens are never seen in the series and their physical appearance is never described

At the end of the miniseries a Six says By your command to an Eight This phrase is usually spoken to the Imperious leader in the old series by Centurions It seemed to give this particular Eight a leadership role

Sharon Boomer Valerii first appears as a Raptor pilot aboard the Galactica Her true nature as a Cylon was revealed at the end of the miniseries She acted as a sleeper agent unaware of her true nature and programmed to carry out attacks on the fleet without realizing what she is doing She was revealed to be an Eight in the episode Downloaded

The other significant Eight Sharon Athena Agathon married Karl Helo Agathon rebelled against the Cylons and joined forces with the Colonials Her child with Helo a daughter named Hera is the first Cylonhuman hybrid Such a child is the subject of a Cylon prophecy Its importance increased as it was a child born of love Shortly after Heras birth Roslin decides to mislead the Cylons into believing the child has died Her plan involves lying to Athena and Helo and giving the child to an adoptive mother Maya While aiding the Colonials in their plan to rescue the humans on New Caprica Athena sneaks into a Cylon storage facility and steals launch codes for the civilian ships trapped on New Caprica She is discovered by DAnna who informs her that Hera is still alive citing strange dreams and a prophecy by a human mystic as proof Athena believing this to be a ruse kneecaps DAnna During the exodus from New Caprica Heras caregiver is killed and DAnna finds the baby Boomer later tells Athena that Hera lives Athena has Helo kill her Athena allowing her to download into a new body within the Cylon fleet With the help of Caprica Six she rescues Hera and returns to Galactica

Eight is described as weak by Baltars Head Six and Eights usually appear more compassionate and sympathetic than other Cylons However they fully supported the destruction of the Colonies The actions of Boomer and an Eight who had a duplicitous affair with Felix Gaeta on New Caprica make it clear that Eights are capable of homicide and betrayal Eights are also capable of intense loyalty and have the ability to break from Cylon traditions and laws to help human friends or family They vote to save humanity in the Cylon civil war that Boomer starts She hesitates for a while when Cavil influences her but in the end chooses to support the humans even if it means that she must give up her life

Athena becomes completely assimilated in human culture Her child and husband become her lifes focus She is the only Cylon to create a family The Eights perceived fragility camouflage great strength and direction In one episode Athena hardwires herself to Galactica hacks into a Cylon fleet and shuts them down

Eights are played by Grace Park

Cavil killed and boxed the Final Five Later he resurrected them purged their memories and sent them to live among the humans The other six models had no knowledge of the Final Fives identities presumably blocked by Cavil though they were aware of the existence of five absent models who were not to be spoken of When DAnna a Three attempts to learn their identities Cavil boxes her entire model line as punishment In the final episode of the third season four of the final five are revealed to be characters with long histories on the Galactica Their purpose and how and why they were hidden from the rest of their kind is a major plot point of the fourth and final season when Ellen Tigh is revealed to be the fifth member

The Final Five were Cylon models who could not be named or researched by skinjobs Rapture They were the original humanoid Cylons born 2000 years before the series on Earth as part of the Thirteenth Tribe Sometimes a Great Notion They were born to Cylon parents through sexual reproduction rather than built They were the researchers who rebuilt the Cylon resurrection technology that had been abandoned when the Thirteenth Tribe gained the ability to procreate Saul and Ellen were married at the time while Tyrol and Foster were in love and planned to marry No Exit

While on Earth the Final Five learned of the upcoming attack on the Colonies from beings Angels only they can see They placed the resurrection technology on a ship in Earth orbit When the nuclear attack kills them they resurrect on the ship and head for the Colonies to warn them They arrive during the First Cylon War unbeknownst to the humans and make a deal with the Centurions stop the war and they will help them build human bodies They build the first model One Cavil who helps them build seven other models Sometimes a Great Notion

Cavil then kills and boxes the Five and removes the memory of their identities from the other Cylons He later unboxes them replacing their memories Cavil periodically seeds them among the human populations starting with Saul and then Ellen to show them the evils of humanity

The Five are fully Cylon  although fundamentally different from the others Unlike the other models they do not have model numbers

Other Cylons do not talk about the Five Torn

Saul Tigh Michael Hogan and Galen Tyrol Aaron Douglas are Galactica officers while Samuel T Anders Michael Trucco is an athlete on Caprica Tory Foster Rekha Sharma is a political operative who is rescued from Caprica and works for Roslin Ellen Tigh Kate Vernon is the fifth member as Saul later realizes as more of his memory returns Sometimes a Great Notion Ellen resurrected after she is poisoned by Saul for giving rescue mission plan to Cavil on New Caprica This restores her memory of her life as a Cylon No Exit

The Five awaken when they begin to hear strange music This seems to affect other Cylons A Raider scans Anders and disengages an attack Aboard Galactica Caprica Six tells Roslin that she can feel the Final Five and that they are near He That Believeth In Me Twos Sixes and Eights believe that the Raiders called off the attack because they sensed the Final Five something with which the Ones Fours and Fives disagree This disagreement leads directly to the Cylon Civil War in which the Twos Sixes and Eights rebel Six of One A standoff between Galactica and the rebel Baseship exposes the four as Cylons to the humans but Lee Adama in his capacity as acting President grants them amnesty as part of an alliance Revelations

Only Anders and Ellen regain their complete memories when Anders gets shot in the head it seems to break Cavils block on his memory while Ellens resurrection restores all of her memories Cavil had planned for the Five to die in the destruction of the Colonies download regain their true memories and apologize for their faith in humanity The Plan Instead four of the Final Five survive the destruction of the Colonies without resurrecting Tigh and Tyrol were on Galactica and Tory and Anders survived through luck while Cavil kept Ellen alive so she could suffer more and learn her lesson Cavils plan thus fails as all of the Five with the possible exception of Foster maintain their loyalty to humanity

They play a major role in ending the second war taking a prominent role in the Battle of The Colony especially Anders who acts as Galacticas Hybrid and shuts down the Colonys weapons and Hybrids The Five also nearly bring a peace between human and Cylon by exchanging resurrection technology which can only be rebuilt by the combined knowledge of the Five for peace

They see each others memories and Tyrol learns that Tory had murdered his wife In a rage he strangles her shattering the temporary peace although a fortuitous nuclear explosion and Cavils subsequent suicide effectively ends the war moments later

After escaping and reaching a new Earth Anders flies the fleet into the Sun destroying it and himself leaving only three of the Final Five alive

The Hybrids resemble human beings inside an immersion tank similar to a Cylon rebirthing tank The Hybrids are cyborgs consisting of conduits and other connectors mated to biological elements The Hybrid is not one of the thirteen models It represents a step on the path from mechanical Centurion to partially biomechanical Raider to Hybrid to skinjob Hybrids are so integrated into the basestars functionality that they are for all practical purposes its brains

Hybrids continually speak what most of the humanoid Cylons consider to be gibberish although there is some difference of opinion on this point Many Cylons believe a hybrids conscious mind is completely mad and the functions it performs are part of a deeper state of mind in connection with the ship Caprica Six states that the Conoy model believes that every word a hybrid says is channeled from the Cylon god A Hybrid is not allowed to vote in the Cylon democratic process though it sometimes objects to the resulting decisions for example leaving another basestar full of diseaseinfected Cylons to their fates

One Hybrid considered the First Hybrid in Cylon lore was the result of experiments on humans during the First Cylon War and appears to be more coherent and prophetic than the others It went rogue as early as the end of the First War and is protected by model 0005 Cylons called Guardians who consider it their god According to the skinjobs the First Hybrid and its Guardians are legends The Colonial Fleet accidentally clashes with the Guardians destroying them the First Hybrid along with its basestar The First Hybrid has the appearance of an old man whereas the standard Hybrids look like young women and are identical

After he is shot in the head and enters a vegetative state Samuel Anders is connected to a datastream and as a result develops Hybridlike abilities whereupon he acts as Galacticas Hybrid When hooked up he speaks and acts like a Hybrid This shows that apparently under special circumstances normal Cylons or at least the Final Five can become Hybridlike beings

The Basestar Hybrids are played by Tiffany LyndallKnight The First Hybrid is played by Campbell Lane

Humanoid Cylons except for the Cavil models follow a monotheistic religion Religious fanaticism partially motivates their attempted genocide of humanity Despite their origins the Cylons believe themselves to be spiritual beings This monotheism seems to share some of the characteristics as the Abrahamic religions belief that God is omniscient omnipotent omnibenevolent that he will one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the mundane world Their beliefs are different from the Abrahamic religions in that they deal with issues such as consciousness enlightenment and reincarnation

Moore said that this spirituality comes when a species becomes sentient and selfaware  questioning faith and religion and about what happens after death

The different Cylon models have slightly different ways of talking about and dealing with their god reflecting the different aspects of humanity that each Cylon model reflects Ones do not all believe in God and can be agnostic or atheist In contrast Twos are fanatically religious

Some Cylons are physically stronger than humans While this is obvious with respect to Centurions the extent to which the Twelve are also is unclear In the miniseries William Adama fought with a Two who despite suffering from the effects of radiation proved to be stronger The Two managed to break off a metal pipe to use as a club and lift Adama off the floor with one arm Another Two was able to break apart a pair of metal handcuffs while under interrogation Flesh and Bone A Six engaged Kara Thrace handtohand and proved to be exceptionally fast agile and strong Kobols Last Gleaming II Despite this Cylons are vulnerable to most of the same things as humans The Two who fought Adama was beaten to death with a flashlight while the Six who fought Thrace was impaled by a piece of rebar While the Twelve may match or exceed human strength they do not display superhuman powers or resilience Cylon skin appears just as vulnerable to breaking as human skin bleeding just as a comparable wound would in a human

Cylons mental faculties are sufficiently similar to those of a human to allow for manipulation Cain and Thrace exploited this fact while interrogating Cylons The experience of death even with resurrection is traumatic and can leave deep emotional damage

Cylons are susceptible to an ancient virus that can be transmitted by rodents to which humans are immune lymphocytic encephalitis This virus was carried on a beacon left by the Thirteenth Tribe at the Lions Head Nebula millennia before and disrupts all organic Cylon technology including Raiders Hybrids which in turn disrupts Centurions and the skinjobs The humans speculate that the beacon was accidentally contaminated when someone sneezed The Cylons believe that a critical symptom of this virus a harmful bioelectric feedback can be transmitted during a download and attempt to prevent infected Cylons from downloading The only immune Cylon is Athena who had given birth to a halfhuman child and thus inherited human antibodies from her offspring although it is unclear whether she retained this immunity after downloading

Dr Cottle developed a vaccine after some Twelves were infected on a basestar near the Lions Head Nebula The disease requires regular booster shots to keep an infected Cylon healthy The Cylons failed to develop a cure or a vaccine to the virus

Cylons silica pathways are affected by certain forms of radiation such as that surrounding Ragnar Anchorage It is assumed but not stated that this radiation affects all of the skinjobs as the station was chosen as a refuge by Commander Adama before he learned of the existence of biomechanical models The radiation had deleterious effects on the Two they found at Ragnar Anchorage but not on Adama This suggests that humans are not vulnerable to this type of radiation

Plutonium is used for Baltars Cylon Detector because its radiation affects humans and Cylons differently The detector was dropped as a method of exposing hidden Cylons early in Season 2 as the revelation that Boomer a test subject was a Cylon convinced the command staff that the detector did not work

Shaw was first introduced to music by her uncle Jimmy Burgess a jazz trumpet player In an interview with The New York Times she told the reporter He Jimmy Burgess introduced me to good music through records  Dizzy Gillespie Miles Davis a lot of gospel things and Al Hibbler who really knows how to phrase a song In 1952 Burgess brought her on stage at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to sing with his band Shaws mother did not want Marlena to go on tour with her uncle at such a young age Instead she enrolled Shaw into the New York State Teachers College in Potsdam now known as the State University of New York at Potsdam to study music She later dropped out of school got married and had five children but never gave up her singing career

Shaw began to make singing appearances in jazz clubs whenever she could spare the time The most notable of these appearances was in 1963 when she worked with jazz trumpeter Howard McGhee She was supposed to play at the Newport Jazz Festival with McGhee and his band but left the group after getting into an argument with one of the band members Later that year she got an audition with Columbia label talent scout John Hammond Shaw did not perform well during the audition because she was too nervous Undeterred she continued to play small clubs until 1966 Her career took off in 1966 when she landed a gig with the Playboy Club chain in Chicago It was through this gig that she met with representatives of the Chess Records music label and soon signed with them She released her first two albums on their subsidiary Cadet Records A 1969 album track California Soul a funksoul tune written by Ashford  Simpson and originally issued as a single by American pop quintet The 5th Dimension later became a staple of the UK rare groove scene This song has appeared in television commercials for Dockers KFC and Dodge Ram trucks Because of television advert exposure it may be Shaws best known recording in the UK Unable to find her own style at Chess she moved to the jazzoriented Blue Note Records in 1972

In 1977 she released an LP Sweet Beginnings on Columbia that contained arguably Shaws finest moment Yu Ma  Go Away Little Boy a medley containing the old Goffin and Carole King standard originally recorded by Nancy Wilson The album also contained the track Look At Me Look At You popular on the UK rare groove scene She also recorded one of the disco eras biggest hits a remake of Touch Me in the Morning also on Columbia Records

In 1982 Marlena recorded the Gary Taylor ballad called Without You In My Life from the LP Let Me In Your Life that was jointly produced by Johnny Bristol and Webster Lewis on South Bay records This had moderate chart success in the USA In 1983 she recorded the vocals for Could It Be You a track by Phil Upchurch on his Name Of The Game album

Shaw still performs and records today In 2001 and again in 2007 Shaw was one of the performers at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands

Faltonia Betitia Proba
Faltonia Betitia Proba c AD 306315  c 353366 was a Latin Roman Christian poet perhaps the earliest female Christian poet whose work survives A member of one of the most influential aristocratic families she composed the Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi a cento composed with verses by Virgil reordered to form an epic poem centred on the life of Jesus

Proba belonged to an influential family of the 4th century the Petronii Probi Her father was Petronius Probianus Roman consul in 322 while her mother was probably called Demetria She had a brother Petronius Probinus appointed consul in 341 also her grandfather Pompeius Probus had been a consul in 310 Proba married Clodius Celsinus Adelphus praefectus urbi of Rome in 351 thus creating a bond with the powerful gens Anicia They had at least two sons Quintus Clodius Hermogenianus Olybrius and Faltonius Probus Alypius who became high imperial officers She also had a granddaughter Anicia Faltonia Proba daughter of Olybrius and Tirrania Anicia Juliana

Her family was pagan but Proba converted to Christianity when she was an adult influencing her husband and her sons who converted after her Proba died before Celsinus She was probably buried with her husband in the Basilica di SantAnastasia al Palatino in Rome where until the 16th century there was their funerary inscription later moved to Villa Borghese before disappearing The bond between Proba and this church might be related to Saint Anastasia who probably belonged to the gens Anicia Proba and Celsinus could have received the honour of being buried ad sanctos next to the tomb of a saint because of the particular veneration of the Anicii for this saint

With her husband she owned the Horti Aciliorum at Rome on the Pincian Hill

Two poems are attributed to Proba and only one is extant Most modern scholars identify Faltonia Betitia Proba as the author of these works with the other possible identification being her niece Anicia Faltonia Proba

The first poem now lost is called Constantini bellum adversus Magnentium The War of Constantine against Magnentius by the Codex Mutinensis It dealt with the war between Roman Emperor Constantius II and the usurper Magnentius Proba was involved to this war through her husband Clodius Celsinus Adelphus who had been praefectus urbi of Rome in 351 that the same year Italy passed from the sphere of influence of Magnetius to Constantius after the Battle of Mursa Major

The existence of this first poem is based on the first verses of the second poem Here Proba rejects her first Pagan composition and scholars think that the Pagan poem was destroyed according to her will

Probas most famous work is a Virgilian centoa patchwork of verses extracted from several works of Virgil with minimal modificationsentitled Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi A Virgilian Cento Concerning the Glory of Christ The 694 lines are divided into a proemium with invocation lines 155 episodes from the Old Testament lines 56345 episodes from the New Testament lines 346688 and an epilogue lines 689694

Universities Space Research Association
The Universities Space Research Association USRA was incorporated on March 12 1969 in Washington DC as a private nonprofit corporation under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences NAS Institutional membership in the association has grown from 49 colleges and universities when it was founded to the current 105 institutions All member institutions have graduate programs in space sciences or technology Besides the 95 member institutions in the United States there are two member institutions in Canada four in Europe two in Israel one in Australia and one in Hong Kong

USRA provides a mechanism through which universities can cooperate effectively with one another with the government and with other organizations to further space science and technology and to promote education in these areas Its mission is carried out through the institutes centers divisions and programs Administrative and scientific personnel now number about 420 A unique feature of USRAs management is its system of standing panels of technical experts drawn from the research community to provide oversight for USRAs institutes centers divisions and programs

USRAs origins extend back to 1966 when the NASA Administrator requested the help of the NAS in forming a national consortium to assume management of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory The president of the NAS Dr Frederick Seitz first turned to the Universities Research Association URA which had recently been created to operate the National Accelerator Laboratory Seitz raised the issue of NASAs involvement at a URA meeting in the fall of 1966 However because of budgetary concerns with the National Accelerator Laboratory URA did not wish to assume any additional responsibilities

To satisfy its immediate needs NASA took upon itself the management of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory but left open the possibility of wider participation of the academic community through an institute At this time the idea of a Lunar Science Institute LSI took form To develop further the concept of the LSI the NAS created a committee under the chairmanship of Dr Kenneth Pitzer to study NASAUniversity Relations In the fall of 1967 the Pitzer Committee recommended the establishment of the LSI initially to be operated by Rice University under a subcontract with the NAS but eventually to be operated by a university consortium The Pitzer committee concluded that the pattern established at LSI could form the basis for the development of a much broader link between NASA and the academic community

On March 1 1968 President Lyndon Johnson announced the creation of the Lunar Science Institute LSI and USRA was chartered the following year as the parent organization of LSI The initial headquarters of USRA was at the University of Virginia where Professor A R Kuhlthau served as the first president of the association

In 1976 Dr Alexander J Dessler became the second USRA president Dessler moved the headquarters of the association to Rice University where he served as chairman of the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy

In 1978 USRA headquarters moved to Columbia Maryland

Dr David C Black was appointed USRA president in 2000 Black served as director of USRAs Lunar and Planetary Institute from 1988 to 2001 and is internationally recognized for research in theoretical astrophysics and planetary science

Dr Jeffrey Isaacson was named president and CEO of USRA effective October 20 2014

USRA initially concentrated on the management of Lunar Science Institute later renamed the Lunar and Planetary Institute but armed with its broad charter the consortium began to explore other ways to serve the university space research community as early as 1970 Today USRA researchers are involved with university government and industry scientists and engineers in a broad array of space and aeronautics related fields including astronomy and astrophysics earth sciences microgravity life sciences space technology computer science and advanced concepts

Most USRA research activities include related educational components

MG WA
The MG WA is a sporting saloon that was produced by MG between 1938 and 1939 and was at the time the largest and heaviest car the company had built Although similar to the SA the car had a wider track at the rear allowing a larger body to be fitted

The car used a tuned version of the sixcylinder Morris QPHG engine enlarged to 2561cc The compression ratio was increased to 725 to 1 and a new balanced crankshaft was fitted Drive was to the live rear axle via a fourspeed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top three ratios and a divided propshaft Wire wheels were fitted and the 14 inch drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system 

The saloon body was made inhouse by Morris and was a spacious fourdoor with traditional MG grille flanked by two large chrome plated headlights It can be distinguished from the outwardly similar SA by the front bumper which has a dip in the centre and the spare wheel was carried on the front wing as opposed to the boot lid Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat with folding centre arm rest at the rear all with leather covering and a return was made to the traditional octagonal framed instruments 

The factory could also supply the car from their catalogue as a Tickford drophead coup built by Salmons and Son or fourdoor tourer by Charlesworth and some chassis went to other coachbuilders including Kellner of Paris and Reinbolt of Switzerland The saloon was priced at GBP442 the fourseat tourer GBP450 and the Tickford coup GBP468

Production stopped with the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and the car was not reintroduced in 1945

Fiddler ray
Trygonorrhina also known as the fiddler rays or banjo rays is a genus of guitarfish family Rhinobatidae The two species are found along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia They are benthic in nature favoring shallow sandy bays rocky reefs and seagrass beds The eastern fiddler is found to a depth of 120 m and the southern fiddler to a depth of 180 m

The flattened pectoral fin discs of fiddler rays are shorter and more rounded than those of other guitarfishes Their tails are slender with a welldeveloped caudal fin and two triangular dorsal fins Their snouts are translucent The fiddler rays are also distinguished from other guitarfishes in that the anterior nasal flaps of their nostrils are expanded backwards and fused together into a nasal curtain that reaches the mouth

Fiddler rays feed on bottoms shellfish crabs and worms which they crush between their jaws The eastern fiddler ray is known to scavenge from fish traps Like other guitarfishes fiddler rays are ovoviviparous The egg capsules of the southern fiddler ray are reported to be golden in colour containing three embryos each It gives birth to litters of four to six young per breeding cycle Fiddler rays are harmless and easily approached by divers Southern fiddler rays are taken as bycatch by commercial trawlers and by recreational fishers the flesh is of good quality and sold in small quantities
The Magpie fiddler ray previously Trygonorrhina melaleuca is now considered a variant of Trygonorrhina dumerilii

There are currently 2 recognized species in this genus

douard Chavannes
mmanueldouard Chavannes 5 October 1865  29 January 1918 was a French Sinologist and expert on Chinese history and religion and is best known for his translations of major segments of Sima Qians Records of the Grand Historian the works first ever translation into a Western language

Chavannes was a prolific and influential scholar and was one of the most accomplished Sinologists of the modern era notwithstanding his relatively early death at age 52 in 1918 A successor of 19th century French sinologists JeanPierre AbelRmusat and Stanislas Julien Chavannes was largely responsible for the development of Sinology and Chinese scholarship into a respected field in the realm of French science

douard Chavannes was born on 5 October 1865 in Lyon France As a youth he studied at the lyce in Lyon where like most students of his era his education focused mainly on the Latin and Greek Classics Chavannes was then sent to Paris to attend the prestigious Lyce LouisleGrand where he and his classmates studied and prepared for the entrance exams to one of the French Grandes coles Chavannes passed his entrance exams and was admitted to the Lettres literature section of the cole Normale Suprieure in 1885 Chavannes spent three years at the school finishing in 1888 after successfully passing his agrgation in philosophy

Georges Perrot a French archaeologist and newly appointed director of the cole Normale Suprieure advised Chavannes to begin studying China after he finished his schooling Chavannes first considered studying Chinese philosophy which was nearer to his own educational background but on the advice of the French scholar Henri Cordier he ultimately decided to focus on Chinese history which up to that time had been much less widely studied in the West Chavannes began attending Classical Chinese courses given by the Marquis dHerveySaintDenys at the Collge de France and the Mandarin Chinese classes of Maurice Jametel 18561889 at the cole des Langues Orientales Vivantes School of Living Oriental Languages Desiring to advance his studies with actual experience in China Chavannes used the connections of certain friends of his to obtain a position as an attach to a scientific mission associated with the French Legation in Peking modern Beijing He departed for China in January 1889 and arrived two months later As a sinologist Chavannes took the Chinese name Sha Wan  and the courtesy name Zilan  and he also had an art name Shicheng Boshi  The Doctor of Lyon
In 1891 Chavannes briefly returned to France where he married Alice Dor the daughter of a wellknown optometrist in Lyon before returning to China with her Together they had a son Fernand Henri Chavannes who later became a highly decorated flying ace during World War I and two daughters

Chavannes stayed in China until 1893 when he returned to France to take up the position of Professor of Chinese at the Collge de France which had been vacated upon the death of the Marquis dHerveySaintDenys in November 1892 Although Chavannes had only been studying Chinese for five years the quality and value of his early Chinese scholarship had already been widely recognized in the academic community and convinced the regents of the Collge de France to give the position to him Chavannes opened his tenure with a lecture entitled Du Rle social de la littrature chinoise On the Social Role of Chinese Literature During his tenure at the Collge Chavannes was widely active in French academic circles he was a member of the Institut de France was an honorary member of a number of foreign societies served as a French coeditor of the noted sinological journal Toung Pao from 1904 until 1916 and was elected President of the Academie des Inscriptions et BellesLettres in 1915

Chavanness granddaughter Claire Chavannes had a son with physicist Paul Langevins grandson Bernard Langevin the french mathematician Remi Langevin

Chavannes first scholarly publication Le Trait sur les sacrifices Fong et Chan de Sema Tsien traduit en franais Sima Qians Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices Translated into French which was published in 1890 while he was in Beijing inspired him to begin a translation of Sima Qians Records of the Grand Historian Shiji  the first of Chinas dynastic histories The first volume of the translation was published in Paris in 1895 and begins with a 249page introduction which the German anthropologist Berthold Laufer described as a masterpiece of historical and critical analysis not surpassed by anything of this character written before or after him Chavannes produced four additional volumes between 1896 and 1905 covering 47 of the 130 chapters of the Records and complete with full commentary and indices His translations also include a large number of appendices covering topics of special interests

Chavannes was major pioneer in the field of modern epigraphy and was praised by Berthold Laufer as the first European scholar who approached this difficult subject with sound and critical methods and undisputed success His first epigraphical article Les Inscriptions des Tsin Qin Inscriptions was published in Journal Asiatique in 1893 which was followed later by a number of works in which Chavannes was the first Western scholar to successfully analyze and translate the unusual epigraphical style of the Mongolruled Yuan dynasty Chavannes returned to China in 1907 to study ancient monuments and inscriptions taking hundreds of photographs and rubbings that were published in 1909 in a large album entitled Mission archologique dans la Chine septentrionale Archaeological Mission to Northern China He published two volumes of translations and analysis of the inscription material before his death La Sculpture  lpoque des Han Sculpture in the Han Era published in 1913 and La Sculpture bouddhique Buddhist Sculpture published in 1915

Chavannes was intrigued by and performed extensive research into the major religions of ancient and medieval China Chinese folk religion Buddhism Daoism Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism His Mmoire compos  lpoque de la grande dynastie Tang sur les religieux minents qui allrent chercher la loi dans les pays doccident par ITsing Memoir Written in the Grand Tang Dynasty by Yijing on the Religious Men Who Went to Search for the Law in the Western Lands which was published in 1894 and won the Prix Julien contains translations of the biographies and travelogues of sixty Buddhist monks who journeyed from China to India during the Tang dynasty in search of Buddhist scriptures and Sanskrit books Chavannes bestknown work on Chinese Buddhism is his threevolume work Cinq cents contes et apologues extraits du Tripiaka chinois Five Hundred Tales and Fables from the Chinese Tripiaka

Chavannes 1910 book Le Tai Chan essai de monographie dun culte chinois Tai Shan Monographic Essay on a Chinese Cult is a detailed study of the indigenous Chinese folk religion which predates Buddhism and religious Daoism and focuses on an ancient mountain cult centered on Mt Tai that Chavannes visited personally This monumental work begins with introductory essays on the generally sacred role of mountains in Chinese history and culture then examines the personality of Mt Tai itself in great detail Chavannes includes translations of dozens of relevant passages from ancient medieval and premodern Chinese literature including comments and passages gathered by medieval scholars Zhu Xi and Gu Yanwu His study also includes eleven translations from rubbings of stone inscriptions Chavannes made himself in temples he visited on and around Mt Tai as well as a detailed handdrawn topographic map of the mountain that Chavannes drew himself Chavannes style in Le Tai Chan with his annotated translations extensive commentary and exhaustively researched sources was inspirational and influential to later French sinologists

In 1912 Chavannes and his former student Paul Pelliot edited and translated a Chinese Manichaean treatise that Pelliot had discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the Mogao caves The book published in Paris as Un trait manichen retrouv en Chine A Manichaean Treatise Found in China was praised by Berthold Laufer upon Chavannes death in 1918 as perhaps the most brilliant achievement in modern sinology

French Frith Kaiser Thompson
French Frith Kaiser Thompson was a United StatesEnglish experimental rock quartet comprising John French Fred Frith Henry Kaiser and Richard Thompson The band was formed in 1987 to create an album Live Love Larf  Loaf In 1990 they recorded their second album Invisible Means and performed live in Berkeley California to promote this album

Experimental American musicians guitarist Henry Kaiser and drummer John French Drumbo from Captain Beefhearts Magic Band began collaborating in 1987 They invited English musicians Fred Frith experimental guitarist from Henry Cow and Richard Thompson folkrock guitarist from Fairport Convention to join them to make an album

They recorded Live Love Larf  Loaf in San Francisco in March 1987 an eclectic collection of songs drawn from a variety of music genres including folk RB and avantgarde rock Most of the album comprised compositions from each of the members of the group plus a few covers including The Beach Boys Surfin USA

While the group experimented with folk and rock music it is generally felt that Thompsons presence did tone down the avantgarde leanings of the other three musicians Mark Deming states in AllMusic that  the slightly bent wit and angular guitar figures of Richard Thompsons signature brand of folkrock certainly added a spoonful of sugar that helped the avantleaning art rock of Henry Kaiser Fred Frith and John French go down more easily

The group reassembled in San Francisco in March 1990 to record Invisible Means another collection of skewed songs from each of the members plus one cover Loch Lomond

Little Switzerland landscape
A little Switzerland or Schweiz is a landscape often of wooded hills This Romantic aesthetic term is not a geographic category but was widely used in the 19th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists Since it was ambiguous from the very beginning it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that a landscape had some features though on a much smaller scale that might remind a visitor of Switzerland

The original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in Europe the bulk of them Germanspeaking as well as to other parts of the world to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out usually amid steep forest The original 18thcentury comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the Jura Mountains on the FrancoSwiss border which hardly rise higher than 1700 metres 

Histories of Saxon Switzerland Schsische Schweiz in Saxony Germany assert that the landscape description schweiz arose there at the end of the 18th century Schweiz is the Germanlanguage name of Switzerland The term was used both alone and with the prefix little for example in the title of an 1820 German booklength poem Die kleine Schweiz by Jakob Reiselsberger which praised the rocky scenery of a part of Franconia in Germany known thereafter as the Franconian Switzerland Frnkische Schweiz

The term was already colloquial by this time in English in 1823 a correspondent asserted in The Gentlemans Magazine that a steep area by the road outside Petersfield in southern England was a little Switzerland The aesthetic term to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude was also in common use in other European languages including the French term Suisse Rocks and wild landscapes were a favoured theme in Romantic painting

The many English places praised in 19thcentury promotional literature as little Switzerland include Church Stretton Whitfield and the coastal area around the North Devon twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth Chaletstyle buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little Switzerland pretensions for example at Matlock Bath which unusually for England also features a cable car

From the beginning the term was often understood as a comparison to the snowcapped Alps rather than to the Jura The following passage describing Wales appears in an 1831 Englishlanguage edition of MalteBruns Universal Geography which had originally been written in French in 180307 

Describing the Atlantic island of St Helena in A New Voyage Round the World 182326 Otto von Kotzebue and Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz were translated into English as writing 

In the United States the raw White Mountains of New Hampshire which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of American Romantic painting were termed a little Switzerland by travel writer Henry Tudor as early as 1832

In the later 19th century authors and tourism promoters would praise picturepostcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as a little Switzerland or schweiz Whereas the earlier use had implied a landscape of dangers this was a term for beauty 

This usage reflected today in the official geographical terms for the Holstein Switzerland Holsteinische Schweiz and Mecklenburg Switzerland Mecklenburgische Schweiz in Germany where there are neither mountains nor outcrops is difficult to account for but may refer to prestigious Swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as Zurich Lucerne or Interlaken or to Lakes Geneva and Constance

The term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to Switzerland became affordable By the 21st century it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the little Switzerland label applied at all to regions such as the Suisse Normande or to the Holstein Switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than 150 metres above the lake surfaces

In 1992 the Swiss Tourism Federation counted more than 190 places round the world that had at least for some period been named after Switzerland either because of a fancied scenic resemblance in jest or referring to a banking haven political neutrality or habitation by Swiss emigrants No fewer than 67 places in neighbouring Germany were said by the Federation to have adopted little Switzerland names 

While the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places it persists as the official geographical name for several administrative regions and national parks including with dates of legal designation

Business promotion regions using the name without legally defined boundaries include

Notable privately developed properties known by the name include

In English Little Switzerland is usually said without any definite article or additional adjective but often with a genitive modifier if there are several little Switzerlands within one nation eg North Carolinas Little Switzerland In European languages where Switzerland proper takes a definite article little Switzerlands do likewise Their English names may echo the vernacular being capitalized and modified to the English alphabet sometimes taking an English definite article eg the Saechsische Schweiz die Schsische Schweiz and the Suisse Normande la Suisse normande English forms are also widespread eg Holstein Switzerland Dickinson 1964 Swiss Franconia Michelin 1993 Franconian Switzerland Fodor 1962 and Bolt 2005

Battle of Karanovasa
The Battle of Karanovasa lit Battle of the Trenches took place on 10 October 1394 between the Wallachian army led by Voivode Mircea cel Btrn against an Ottoman invasion led by Sultan Bayezid I This battle is sometimes confused with the later Battle of Rovine lit Battle of the Marshes Rovine is old RomanianLatin for ruins modern Italian rovinare to tear down between the same combatants and which took place also along the valley of the Arge River

The Ottoman Empire emerged as a small principality in the early fourteenth century in the northwestern part of the Anatolian Peninsula In the following decades the Ottoman Sultans combined their growing military strength with astute dynastic politics to expand their territory eastwards into the whole of Anatolia and westwards into the Balkan Peninsula Thus in 1387 Murad I 136289 conquered much of Greece and fought a large Christian army at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 In the early 1390s his successor Bayezid I 13891402 established his suzerainty over Stefan Lazarevi of Serbia the Turnovo Bulgaria of Ivan Shishman and the Vidin Despotate of Ivan Sratsimir The Ottoman Empire had become one of the most important powers in the Balkans threatening the remaining independent states of central Europe Wallachia Moldavia the Kingdom of Hungary as well as the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea Mircea of Wallachia previously secured an alliance with several Karamanid princes of Anatolia which antagonized Bayezid I Yet Bayezid despite defeating the Karamanids had to plan and act every action carefully since he had more enemies than friends among the Muslim Turkish aristocracy and could not simply turn around and declare a new holy war against those whose troops helped the Karamanid princes in Anatolia His opportunity came when the Wallachians and the Hungarians invaded the weak states from the south of the Danube which were vassals of Bayezid The Wallachians occupied the Principality of Karvuna and the city of Silistra apparently with the consent of Ivan Shishman while the Hungarians tried to conquer the Vidin Despotate These infringements on his vassals lands gave Bayezid authority to move

Returning from Asia Minor to the Balkans in 1393 the Sultan expelled the Wallachians from Silistra and the Dobruja and declared that Turnovo Tsardom unable to fend for herself was now an Ottoman pashalik The final attack on Wallachia was to take place

In the autumn of 1394 after a raiding campaign along the right bank of the Danube Bayezid launched the attack on Wallachia He commanded the Ottoman Rumelian army and the armies of his Balkan vassals most of which were Bulgarians and Serbs under Stefan Lazarevi the son of the late Serbian prince Lazar The armies crossed the Danube at Nicopolis at advanced along the Arge River with the intention of capturing Curtea de Arge the capital city of Wallachia After a weeklong march in which the constant attacks Wallachian took their toll the Wallachian army met the Ottoman one on October 10 The Wallachians launched a sudden ambush from the forests slowly pushing the Ottomans closely to the bank of the Arge River The bloodiest fighting took place around the Ottoman camp strengthened with earth walls palisades and ditches hendek in Turkish Hence the name with which this battle appears in Serbian chronicles as the Battle of the Trenches of Karanovasa Surrounded the Ottomans managed to resist until the dawn when Bayiezid hardly managed to escape the battle fleeing over the Danube Nevertheless most of his and his vassals armies perished

It would turn out that his vassals suffered more from the Sultans help than they did from the Wallachians and Hungarians The Turnovo Tsardom not only ceased its existence but Ivan Shishman was accused of collaboration with the enemy and was executed at the orders of the Sultan Bayezid spent the winter and the spring warring in Anatolia with Seljuk princes besieging Constantinople and leaving the lands south of the Danube in the hands of Mircea who by now managed to provoke an antiOttoman rebellion as far south as Rumelia

A much better prepared attack in which the entire Ottoman army as well as the whole of the Ottoman vassals took part was started by the Sultan in spring in May 1395 The alliance documents signed at Braov on March 7 between Mircea and Sigismund of Luxembourg reveal that by 1395 a huge concentration of Ottoman forces took place in the southern Dobruja The Ottoman army launched a twodirectional attack via Nicopolis and via VidinCraiova Another Ottoman army group led by Vlad I of Wallachia Mirceas nephew who was attempting to take the throne with Turkish support was invading along the Ialomia River Faced with a much larger force Mircea applied guerrilla tactics and delayed direct confrontation with the Ottoman army until he received help from his ally Sigismund The final confrontation would take place at the Battle of Rovine lit Battle of the Marshes

The University of Iowa began offering creative writing courses in 1897 and began using the term writing workshop in 1939 by the 1970s hundreds of writing workshops were offered by colleges libraries and private groups Scott B Kaufman and James Kaufman describe a brutal atmosphere in educational and professional writing circles that was often masked as critique Starting in the 1970s a popular reaction to this culture emerged as individual teachers sought new ways to teach creative writing

Schneider began to develop the AWA method for teaching writing in workshops and other groups in 1979 Working with a community of writers in Amherst Massachusetts she explored ways to conduct a writing classworkshop that would honor the primary voice encouraging students to trust what the writer John Edgar Wideman has called the language of home She further cites the writer Paule Marshall who has written When people at readings and writers conferences ask me who my major influences were I always acknowledge before all others the group of women around the table long ago They taught me my first lessons in the narrative art They trained my ear They set a standard of excellence This is why the best of my work must be attributed to them it stands as testimony to the rich legacy of language and culture they so freely passed on to me in the wordshop of the kitchen

In 1985 Schneider offered workshops to women living in public housing in Chicopee Massachusetts On Sunday nights for the past eight years the Chicopee Writing Workshop has been changing lives The most important change Pat says is the way the women see themselves Schneider chose to develop the workshop for women in public housing because she believes there is no difference between the rich and the poor in this writing is art and our own stories are the stuff of which our freedom is made our self esteem our power

In 1990 Schneiders workshops became so popular Schneider had to encourage some of her students to break away and start their own groups using her techniques Beginning in 2004 Schneider began training other writers to become workshop leaders Over 1000 writers are now recognized as AWAcertified workshop leaders who have led workshops in the United States Canada Europe Africa and the Middle East Workshops are built around a set of essential affirmations and practices

Stevens Creek Heritage Preserve
Stevens Creek Heritage Preserve is a nature preserve in the US State of South Carolina It is managed by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources It covers in McCormick County and Edgefield County and was established to protect rare animal and plant species Websters Salamander and Miccosukee gooseberry are among the species which have few populations outside the preserve The nearest population center is Clarks Hill about two road miles 34km to the southwest

The site was identified in 1957 by Albert E Radford of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill He noticed exceptional diversity in the tree shrub and herb layers on the bluffs overlooking Stevens Creek and documented six plant species which had been unknown in South Carolina up to that time Another five species were known from only one other South Carolina location Many of these rare species were plentiful at the site and remain prominent there today A remarkable feature of this plant community is that a palmetto Sabal minor occurs near northern inland wildflowers such as Asarum canadense Four trillium species are also present

Soils of the bluffs were found to be atypical for South Carolina Most of the states soils are acidic with pH near or below 5 However some topsoils in the preserve had pH readings near 7  neutral on the scale This is more typical of baserich sites in Appalachian coves and the Midwest where many plants rare to South Carolina are abundant These soils correspond most closely to the Cartecay and Toccoa series which are loam or sandy loamtextured Entisols Along Stevens Creek are alluvial silt loam Inceptisols of the Riverview series The majority of the preserve away from the bluffs is underlain by acidic sandy loam Ultisols of the Cataula Hiwassee Louisburg and Pacolet series typical of the South Carolina Piedmont These upland soils support mixed pine and hardwood forest over most of the preserve except in the southwest corner which has pure stands of pine

<doc id="7708681" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7708681" title="Enchirito">
Enchirito
Enchirito  is the trademarked name of Taco Bells menu item of the TexMex food similar to an enchilada It is composed of a flour tortilla filled with seasoned ground beef taco meat with options to substitute steak or chicken beans diced onions cheddar cheese and red sauce

There is an unsubstantiated claim that the Enchirito was invented in 1967 by a high school student in Montebello CA

However a 2008 article published in the Long Beach PressTelegram claimed that a Cerritos California based franchise owner named Dan Jones had created the Enchirito

In an article published in a Corsicana Daily Sun in 1971 there is a third claim that a Taco Bell franchise owner in Texas was the actual inventor

The original Enchirito of the 1970s was advertised as a special tortilla filled with ground beef pinto beans and onions topped with red sauce cheese and olives It was served in a reheatable aluminum foil tray One of the earliest print reference to the Enchirito is an August 1967 Taco Bell ad in an Amarillo Texas newspaper for a meal consisting of a taco Enchirito and soft drink for 089

Taco Bell registered the name with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a service mark in May 1970 In its application Taco Bell described the item as a  Combination Enchilada And Burrito Prepared As Part Of  Restaurant Services and that Enchirito Is Merely A Fanciful Combination Of Enchilada And Burrito

The coining of the name Enchirito a portmanteau of the words enchilada and burrito for this item was a bit of a peculiar action by Taco Bell It was the only item on the menu at the time to not use the common Mexican food nomenclature for that item Whereas a burrito is typically a flour tortilla filled with beans and an enchilada is typically a corn tortilla filled with meat and smothered in chile sauce the name Enchirito communicates the combination of these elements On the other hand it appears the unusual name was not to help Americans unfamiliar with the Spanish names of the food items indeed for many years Taco Bell menu boards featured a system of phonetic pronunciation guides next to each item

Even after the Enchirito was officially discontinued in 1993 some customers still ordered them and word spread through the Internet that many restaurants would still make them with the ingredients they had available Due to this underground popularity it was decided to bring it back and commercials featuring the Taco Bell chihuahua promoting the Enchirito began airing on December 26 1999 with later commercials in mid2000 featuring the rapping or singing styles of the five guys with no talent However some things about the item had changed The serving container had become a coated pressedpaper oblong bowl when dining in or a black plastic bowl with a clear plastic lid if ordering from the drivethru Most significantly the character of the dish was altered by changing the yellow corn masa tortilla to a white wheat flour tortilla The sliced olives were omitted The chicken Enchirito and the steak Enchirito which respectively substitute chicken or steak for the ground beef were also introduced as options The Enchirito is served with a plastic spork
The Enchirito was once again discontinued when Taco Bell introduced the Smothered Burrito on July 25 2013 While it may not be currently seen on the menu it can be requested when ordering

A typical ground beef enchirito contains 209 calories 17 grams of fat 8 grams saturated 45 milligrams cholesterol and 1110 milligrams of sodium

There is yet another legend associated with Parthasarathy here During the battle of Kurukshetra Duryodhana had taunted Bheeshma of not using his full might in fighting the Pandavas This taunt by Duryodhana filled Bheeshma with rage Bheeshma took a vow to fight with such ferocity the next day that Lord Krishna himself would be forced to break his vow of not using a weapon during the war in order to protect Arjuna On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma when Krishna motivated Arjuna to take initiative and vanquish his foe Bheeshma was unparalleled with the use of celestial weapons in such a manner that Arjuna could not counter the onslaught Arrows after arrows fired from Bheeshmas bow breached the defenses of Arjuna and inflicted wounds to his body by penetrating his armour The string of Arjunas bow the Gandiva was snapped during the battle Seeing Arjunas plight Krishna jumped down in rage and took up his discus charging towards Bheeshma Bheeshma was overfilled with joy and surrendered to Lord Krishna Meanwhile Arjuna beseeched the Lord not to kill Bheeshma as it would have been against Krishnas vow to take up arms in his battle It is believed that it is this image of Krishna that is enshrined here with a discus This symbolizes the Lords act of compassion to both his devotees on either side of the battle Lord Krishna broke his vow to protect Arjuna and also to fulfill the promise that his ardent devotee Bheeshma had made

Lord Krishna presiding here in the Vishvarupa form is considered as Annadana Prabhu The Lord who provides food along with other temples like Vaikom Mahadeva Temple and Sabarimala It is believed that those whose Annaprashana is performed at the Aranmula Parthasarathy temple would never be affected by the pangs of poverty throughout their life

APO Hiking Society
The Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society later popularly known as APO Hiking Society or simply APO was a Filipino musical group The group had its fledgling beginnings in 1969 at the Ateneo de Manila high school with 15 members John Paul Micayabas Lito de Joya Sonny Santiago Gus Cosio Renato Garcia Chito Kintanar Kenny Barton Bruce Brown Butch Dans Kinjo Sawada Ric Segreto Goff Macaraeg Doden Besa Jim Jakolero Paredes and Boboy Garovillo The groups name was created from the acronym AMHS representing their school with a witty twist having an irreverent reference to the paralyzed Philippine revolutionary intellectual and hero Apolinario Mabini and later shortened to Apo an Ilocano term for a wise man or a Tagalog term of grandchildren and later rebranded to APO all caps Contrary to popular belief the Apo name was not a reference to the Philippiness highest peak the potentiallyactive stratovolcano Mount Apo

As the students advanced into college Danny Javier joined the group After graduation the majority of its members left to pursue individual careers with only three members remaining made up of Jim Jakolero Paredes Boboy Garovillo and Danny Javier

In the span of their professional career Apo emerged as a principal adherent of the musical movement termed Original Pilipino Music aka OPM a milieu in which their original musical contributions and cultural influence became essential The Apo became involved in record production talent management and organizing artists under the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mangaawit OPM  The group expanded its activities into establishing and furthering the careers of new OPM artists in the Philippines

To date the group has released 27 albums in four decades of its career Two hugely successful tribute albums were produced in 2006 and 2007 by its management group featuring numerous young bands freshly reinterpreting Apos expansive repertoire

The group frequently utilized their brand name Apo as a clever component for Tagalog puns in titles for television shows live programs and marketing materials for example as in nA PO which transliterates as already politeformal usage and also as ap meaning grandchild The puns have been minimally extended into English as in APOcalyptic 

The Name Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society was meant to be deliberately ironic since the historical figure Apolinario Mabini famously lost the use of his legs to polio

The Apo Hiking Society first gained recognition in 1973 when they gave a farewell concert at the Meralco Theater in Pasig City Metro Manila Philippines Just out of college the group was the talk of the Ateneo de Manila University and adjoining campuses for their music and humor

It was only when two of its four members were about to retire from the field of amateur music however that the APO then known as the Apolinario Mabini Hiking Society finally had a citywide audience One of them was scheduled to leave for Turkey as an exchange student The other had a position waiting for him in his fathers advertising firm

The trip to Turkey did not materialize and the APO now a tentative trio pushed on steadily towards fame and fortune

In late 1978 APO Hiking Society nearly disbanded after Jim Jakolero Paredes stormed out a songwriting session While asking Danny Javier for a 3 syllable word to fill in a line he was provided the word katapusan a 4 syllable word The error went unnoticed until post recording where an irate Paredes noticed that the word had indeed one extra syllable more than what he had originally intended

Looking back the APO members Danny Javier and Boboy Garrovillo do not regret never having been regular wage earners Their farewell concert which had SRO audiences for two stormy nights not unexpectedly became a hit record the following year

In the three decades since that farewell concert the APO has made 22 record albums hosted several television shows including their own noontime Sunday show Sa Linggo nAPO Sila and noontime show from Monday to Saturday Sang Linggo nAPO Sila and launched hugely successful major solo concerts and countless provincial dinner and corporate shows They have performed in over 50 cities in the United States in Canada Singapore Indonesia Germany Switzerland Italy and Japan to bring Original Pilipino Music to Filipinos the world over

In 1978 APO won 2nd Place winner in the Metro Manila Popular Song Festival now MetroPop Song Festival in 1996 to 2003 for their runnerup song Ewan the song was composed by Louie Ocampo

In October 1987 during their annual US tour the APO became the first Filipino pop artists with Marco Sison to perform at the Main Hall of New Yorks prestigious Carnegie Hall They also performed at the equally prestigious Massey Hall in Toronto Canadas music capital Both concerts as well as the other shows held during that particular concert tour were sold out The APO were also the first Filipino artists to perform in a public concert in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia In 1987 they were one of the first Filipino artists to be recorded on compact disc And in 1994 they were awarded the first Dangal ng Musikang Pilipino by Awit Awards  the Filipino equivalent of the Grammy They have also been conferred the Tanglaw Ng Lahi Award the highest accolade given by Jesuits in the field of culture and arts

The APO also earned international recognition for Handog ng Pilipino sa Mundo was recorded by 15 Filipino artists in April 1986 A few months later the English version A New and Better Way was launched in Australia In February 1987 the first anniversary of the Philippines People Power revolution the song was released in London England The lyrics of the song are embedded on a wall of Our Lady of Edsa Shrine the center of the revolution

In 1998 Legendary OPM group APO and defunct band Eraserheads teamed up for their first San Miguel Beer TV commercial Homeboys The concept of reviving and modernizing their originals by rockalternative bands in the 1990s paved the way to two tribute albums by various bands entitled Kami nAPO Muna in 2006 and Kami nAPO Muna Ulit in 2007

In 1999 APO was also a finalist at MetroPop Song Festival for their song finalist Dito Sa Kanto the song was composed by Noel Cabangon then Cabangon covered his version in 1999 then rerecorded again a duet with Parokya Ni Edgar vocalist Chito Miranda in 2013

In 2007 Jacee with the group was awarded as MYX Magna Award 2007 in the MYX Music Awards 2007 achieving the best of opm pop music and also has an achievements in music and recording in the OPM history

In 2009 APO was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk Of Fame contributing their skills in both singing hosting and acting

Just a few years after their hiatus the tribute album Kami nAPO Muna The Music Of APO Hiking Society was released in honor of the group The Filipino musical artists who did their own unique renditions of The APO classics includes Imago Orange and Lemons Parokya ni Edgar Kamikazee Sandwich Sugarfree Itchyworms Sponge Cola Boldstar Sound Drip Rocksteddy Top Suzara Barbie Almalbis Kitchie Nadal Shamrock and The Dawn Their second volume Kami nAPO muna Ulit has also included their new members in the compilation album are True Faith Silent Sanctuary Concrete Sam Up Dharma Down Chilitees The Bloomfields Scrambled Eggs The Spaceflower Show and Hilera

Acoustic Balladeer Noel Cabangon also had a new tribute album to the pinoy pop musical group Throwback Ang Songbook Ng APO was launched in 2014 with features with his cover versions of popular various APO songs in his new album released by Universal Records

On 20 September 2008 Apo Hiking Society had a reunion concert called Apo of the Philippines which was held at the Araneta Coliseum to celebrate their 39th Anniversary They sang all of the APO Favorites and all songs from their past releases

On February 7 2009 The Apo performed in the Open Air FTI Complex in Taguig The free concert was sponsored in cooperation with the Taguig City hall One month later the Eraserheads had their Final Set Concert

On November 17 2009 the Apo Hiking Society marked their 40th anniversary with a big concert at the SM North EDSA Skydome It was called APO KayangKaya Pa This was originally scheduled on September 26 but was rescheduled due to the Typhoon Ondoy Ketsana

Last December 16 2009 the APO Hiking Society announced that they are already retiring as a group due to diminishing creative process They performed a series of shows that started on February 14 2010 and ended on May just in time for the elections They also reunited for the last time to perform in the Inauguration of President Benigno Noynoy Aquino III last June 30 2010

The Blind Side Evolution of a Game
The Blind Side Evolution of a Game is a book by Michael Lewis released on September 2 2006 by W W Norton  Company It focuses on American football

The book features two dominant storylines The first is an examination of how offensive football strategy has evolved over the past three decades in large part due to linebacker Lawrence Taylors arrival in the 1980s and how this evolution has placed an increased importance on the role of the offensive left tackle Most quarterbacks are righthanded and in order to throw they stand with their left shoulders facing down field Thus they turn their backs to linebackers and other defenders pass rushing from the left side creating a vulnerable blind side that the left tackle must protect Taylors speed and power changed the role of outside linebacker to become a more attacking aggressive position This in turn caused teams to emphasize larger and more agile left tackles

The second storyline features Michael Oher the former left tackle for the Ole Miss football team and later right tackle for the Baltimore Ravens Lewis follows Oher from his impoverished upbringing through his years at Briarcrest Christian School his adoption by Sean Michael Lewiss former schoolmate and Leigh Anne Tuohy and on to his position as one of the most highly coveted prospects in college football

The film The Blind Side was directed by John Lee Hancock and primarily follows the story of Michael Oher It stars Quinton Aaron as Oher along with Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw and Kathy Bates It also features appearances by several past and present college football coaches playing themselves

Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast
DTMB Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcast is the TV standard for mobile and fixed terminals used in the Mainland China Cuba Hong Kong and Macau

Previously known as DMBTH Digital Multimedia BroadcastTerrestrialHandheld the DTMB is a merger of the standards ADTBT developed by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University DMBT developed by Tsinghua University and TiMi Terrestrial Interactive Multiservice Infrastructure this last one is the standard proposed by the Academy of Broadcasting Science in 2002

At first neither Shanghai Jiao Tong University nor Tsinghua had enough political strength to make their own technology become the unique standard so the final decision was to opt for a double standard merged with the TIMI 3 standard responding to a need for backward compatibility

The DTMB was created in 2004 and finally became an official DTT standard in 2006

Main channel of province TV in each province



See China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting CMMB



Besides the basic functions of traditional television service the DTMB allows additional services using the new television broadcasting system DTMB system is compatible with fixed reception indoor and outdoor and mobile digital terrestrial television


The DTMB standard uses many advanced technologies to improve their performance for example a pseudorandom noise code PN as a guard interval that allows faster synchronization system and a more accurate channel estimation LowDensity Parity Check LDPC for error correction modulation Time Domain Synchronization  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing TDSOFDM which allows the combination of broadcasting in SD HD and multimedia services etc

This system gives flexibility to the services offered to support the combination of singlefrequency networks SFN and multifrequency networks MFN The different modes and parameters can be chosen depending on the type of service and networks environment

The sequence of pseudorandom pattern is defined in time domain and the information of the Discrete Fourier transform DFT is defined in the frequency domain The two frames are multiplexed in the time domain resulting in Time domain synchronization TDS

This transmission system makes the conversion of the input signal to the output data of terrestrial TV signal

The data passes through the encoder the error protection process FEC Forward Error Correction through the constellation mapping process and then the interleaving processes the information to create the data blocks The data block and the TPS information are multiplexed and pass through the data processor to form the body structure It combines information from the body and the head to form the frame and this is passed through the SRRC Square Root Raised Cosine filter to become a signal within an 8MHz channel bandwidth Finally the signal is modulated to put it in the corresponding frequency band

Kneller Hall
Kneller Hall is a mansion in Whitton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames It houses the Royal Military School of Music training musicians for the British Army which acquired the building in the mid19th century It is also home to the schools Museum of Army Music The Army is scheduled to vacate the site in 2020

The first house on the site was built by Edmund Cooke between 1635 and 1646 and in 1664 was the fourth largest house in Twickenham

In 1709 the property was purchased by Sir Godfrey Kneller court painter to British monarchs from Charles II to George I He had the original house demolished and replaced by a new building reputedly designed by Sir Christopher Wren This second house was known as Whitton Hall after the village but was renamed by Knellers widow in memory of her husband In 1757 the house was sold to Sir Samuel Prime a prominent London lawyer who with his son of the same name extended it significantly and landscaped the grounds After Samuel Prime junior died in 1813 the hall was sold to Charles Calvert Whig MP for Southwark from 1812 to 1832 He further expanded the house to designs by Philip Hardwick adding drawing rooms at the east and west ends of the building Calvert died of cholera in 1832 and his widow inhabited until death about 1845 The house was then acquired by the government as a teacher training college but it needed substantial reconstruction

Around 1850 much of the Wren bulk of the house was dilapidated and so was demolished The Hardwick additions formed the wings of the new house the one still standing today designed by George Mair This third building on the site is stonecorniced casemented and constructed as to its ground floor central range and otherwise built of red bricks all in the neoJacobethan style suitable to 19th and 20th century mansions of its scale It consists of 17 bays the central of which is the widest and of stained glass and the two adjacent of which are arrowslit windows The bays are split into five recessed or projecting ranges Two square pavilion towers form the near left and right bays each tower crowned by a stone and leaded ogeeshaped cupola Its gatepiers and house are separately listed by Historic England in the initial grade II category

From 1850 to 1856 Kneller Hall served as a teacher training college under principal Frederick Temple and viceprincipal Francis Turner Palgrave known for his poetry anthology Palgraves Golden Treasury In exchange for a twoyear college education almost entirely subsidised by the state  one of the first forms of statesponsored social mobility  graduates of the college were supposed to teach pauper and delinquent boys in specially built district schools Though Kneller Hall itself was generously funded by the state the larger scheme to build district schools never came to fruition owing to political and religious conflict The college closed when it was unable to attract any more students who were now expected to teach in miserable conditions in Britains workhouses 

On 3 March 1857 the building was taken over by the War Office as the base for a school for army bandsmen it then evolved into the Royal Military School of Music During the Second World War the site was briefly the headquarters of the CommanderinChief Home Forces from late 1939 until the headquarters moved out to St Pauls School in July 1940

On 18 January 2016 defence minister Mark Lancaster announced that Kneller Hall was one of 12 Ministry of Defence MoD sites proposed to be released as part of the MoDs drive for greater efficiency In November 2016 the MoD announced that the site would close in 2020

Recycling in Canada
This article outlines the position and trends of recycling in Canada Since the 1980s most mid to large municipalities in most provinces have recycling programs As of 2012 Canada has a recycling rate around 268 

In 1981 Resource Integration Systems RIS in collaboration with Laidlaw International tested the first blue box recycling system on 1500 homes in Kitchener Ontario Due to the success of the project the City of Kitchener put out a contract for public bid in 1984 for a recycling system citywide Laidlaw won the bid and continued with the popular blue box recycling system Today hundreds of cities around the world use the blue box system or a similar variation

In Alberta the Alberta Recycling Management Authority also known as Alberta Recycling is an armslength body set up by the Government of Alberta under the Ministry of the Environment to coordinate recycling in the province It administers the surcharge that has been added to the price of electronics paint and tires sold in the province since 2005 to pay for the recycling of those products in Alberta and it helps to administer the provinces household hazardous waste disposal program

A separate management authority the Beverage Container Management Board BCMB is responsible for recycling of beverage containers Beverage container recycling regulations were first introduced provincewide in 1972 but the BCMB was created in 1997 to create a provincial oversight body for the industry The BCMB oversees two nonprofit corporations which process the materials the Alberta Beer Container Corporation ABCC for standardsized beer bottles which reuses rather than recycles the bottles and the Alberta Beverage Container Recycling Corporation ABCRC for all other beverage containers Containers are actually collected at privately owned forprofit bottle depots there are over 200 such bottle depots in Alberta which are members of the Alberta Bottle Depot Association

The Recycling Council of Alberta is a registered charity which has promoted recycling in Alberta since 1987 Specific industry groups lobby for their niche within the recycling sector such as the Alberta Plastics Recycling Association

Curbside recycling of newsprint cardboard plastic packaging and other nonfood household wastes is the responsibility of the individual municipalities of Alberta Most of Albertas most populous municipalities have blue box blue bag or blue bin recycling container programs The two largest municipalities however adopted wastediverting policies at a very different pace Edmonton began a pilot project in curbside recycling for singlefamily houses in 1986 and adopted it citywide in 1988 expanding over the years to include more items Christmas trees in 1990 and construction waste in 2008 and higher levels of processing including largescale composting and capturing methane to produce energy In addition the scope of collection has expanded to include multifamily buildings in 2001 and businesses in 2010 It is expected that when the wastetobiofuel plant is completed in 2012 Edmonton will divert 90 of its waste from landfills

By contrast Calgary conducted a pilot project on curbside recycling in 1991 and then abandoned curbside collection for a dropoff system until a second pilot program in 2004 and currently collects recyclates only at private houses with no plans to introduce collection at condo and apartment buildings before 2015

CP Tank
CP Tank or Cowasjee Patel Tank is a former water tank for supplying drinking water in Girgaon South Mumbai

Although long vanished the city of Bombay once had many water tanks within its city limits The tanks were once the only source of water to the city The tanks were named after philanthropic citizens who donated money to fund the building of these tanks so that the citizens of the city would get a fresh source of drinking water

The CP Tank was built by Cowasji Rustamjee Patel in 1776 The Framji Cowasji Tank bordered Esplanade was built by Framji Cowasji in 1831

All that remains of the tank is a plaque on a wall opposite Metro Cinema in Girgaon

Recycling in the United States
There is no national law in the United States that mandates recycling and state and local governments often introduce their own recycling requirements In 2014 the recyclingcomposting rate for municipal solid waste in the US was 346 A number of US states including California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Iowa Maine Massachusetts Michigan New York Oregon and Vermont have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers while other jurisdictions rely on recycling goals or landfill bans of recyclable materials

On a national level the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA oversees a variety of waste issues These include regulation of hazardous wastes landfill regulations and setting recycling goals

More specific recycling legislation is localized through city or state governments State regulation falls into two major categories landfill bans and recycling goals Landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in a landfill Most often these items include yard waste oil and recyclables easily collected in curbside recycling programs States with landfill bans of recyclables include Wisconsin Minnesota Michigan and North Carolina Other states focus on recycling goals These include California and Illinois One ways in which some states encourage recycling of specific drink containers is through the passage of a bottle bill

A number of US states such as California Hawaii Oregon Connecticut Delaware Maine Vermont Massachusetts Iowa Michigan and New York have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers in order to promote reuse and recycling Most are five cents per can or bottle Michigans has maintained a 10 cent deposit value for bottles and cans since 1976

Some cities such as Seattle and states like Connecticut have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away a certain percentage of recyclable materials in their garbage waste Vermont also employed a landfill ban of recyclable materials food and yard waste and wood There are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law

Disposal of recyclables in the garbage is prohibited from households businesses and apartments For businesses that would include prohibiting the disposal of cardboard paper and yard waste in the garbage For apartments and houses disposal of glass paper cardboard aluminum and plastic in the garbage would be prohibited With businesses and apartments if garbage collectors find more than 10 percent of the container filled with recyclables they will leave a tag On the third tag the business or apartment tenants will receive a 50 fine However households do not face the risk of being fined If trash collectors find over 10 percent of their garbage contains recyclables they will leave a tag asking the household to separate the garbage and recyclables for collection the next week

In a 1996 article in The New York Times John Tierney claimed that government mandated recycling wastes more resources than it saves
Tierneys article received a referenced critique from the Environmental Defense Fund which noted that the article relied heavily on quotes and information supplied by a group of consultants and think tanks that have strong ideological objections to recycling or a vested financial
interest in opposing it

In 2003 Daniel K Benjamin a professor of economics at Clemson University published a paper through the Property and Environment Research Center that reiterated many of the points brought up in the New York Times article backing them up with a detailed inquiry into the recycling industry of the US In 2010 he followed up on that with an updated look into the recycling policies of the US finding that not much has changed

When the recycling industry was in its infancy in the United States the financial costs of collecting depositing and processing recyclables exceeded that of trash disposal Some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as landfill disposal For example recycling efforts in New York City cost 57 million per year in 2002 and by 2015 it cost the city 300 more to recycle each ton of waste than to dump it in landfill To refute this argument people pointed out that the social benefits to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost Landfilling waste is an inefficient use of resources contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways The long term financial and social costs of pollution caused by landfilling waste are often not taken into consideration

However in many regions of the country there are now an economic incentives to recycle As early as 2003 Fort Worth Texas was making 1000000 from their recycling program Similarly Waukesha Countys recycling program in Wisconsin began operating with positive revenues in 2004
Most recently Waukesha County began receiving a 650 per ton bonus for recyclables coming into their private MRF Materials Recycling Facility Combining that with the average revenue from the sale of the materials minus the longterm costs incurred if the items had been landfilled the average total lost revenue countys share for recyclables thrown in the landfill is 11250

Recycling statistics ca 2014


The New York Times reported in May 2018 that in somes cases 25 of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill

Recycling rates vary by material and product type


Electronic waste or ewaste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices Used electronics which are destined for reuse resale salvage recycling or disposal are also considered ewaste Informal processing of ewaste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution

Electronic scrap components such as CPUs contain potentially harmful components such as lead cadmium beryllium or brominated flame retardants Recycling and disposal of ewaste may involve significant risk to workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes

According to the Environmental Protection Agency EPA it is important to dispose of electronics via recycling becauseElectronic products are made from valuable resources and materials including metals plastics and glass all of which require energy to mine and manufacture Donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials Consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher

The Environmental Protection Agency reports 290 million scrap tires were generated in 2003 Of the 290 million 45 million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire retreads In 2017 287 million were generated 38 million reused and 249 million scrapped With landfills minimizing their acceptance of whole tires and the health and environmental risks of stockpiling tires many new markets have been created for scrap tires Growing markets exist for a majority of scrap tires produced every year supported by state and local government Tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products

Tires are not desired at landfills due to their large volumes and 75 void space which quickly consumes valuable space As of 2017 40 states banned whole tires from landfills 38 allowed shredded tires 24 allowed processed tires in monofills Fees are collected by 37 states

In 2017 814 of scrapped tires were marketed for some beneficial use down from 879 in 2015 Of the 3411 thousand tons of marketed scrap tires 508 were used as fuel 296 as ground rubber Of the tires used as fuel 46 were consumed in cement kilns 29 in pulp and paper mills and 25 in electric utility boilers

The United States has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from about 1 billion in 1992 down to 60 million tires in 2017 primarily due to state scrap management programs Most of the remaining stockpiles are in Colorado and Texas

US state laws and regulations dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in 48 states Here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires source of funding for the program licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers processors and end users manifests for scrap tire shipments limitations on who may handle scrap tires financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers and market development activities Some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire These fees sometimes called tipping fees help to support recycling costs When the disposal rates charged to consumers are set high this in turn discourages landfill disposal a simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs

For most of the early 21st century China was the main destination for the worlds scrap material This resulted from a combination of factors including the growing need for metal paper and plastics in Chinas expanding industry lax environmental regulations cheap labor and inexpensive shipping using containers that would otherwise be returned to China empty In the United States this resulted in a strong market for many scrap commodities and allowed local recycling programs to come close to breaking even economically or even to turn a small profit That situation abruptly changed in 2017 when China announced its National Sword program which banned many scrap imports and imposed strict quality standards on others starting in February 2018 Acceptable limits for contamination in imported waste were cut from 510 percent to 05 percent Since then almost no plastic scrap has been exported to China from the United States and shipments of metal and paper scrap have been sharply reduced Scrap plastic imports dropped from 35 million metric tons in 2017 to 21300 metric tons in the first half of 2018 As a result scrap prices in the US have plummeted US recycling industry is responding by investing in better sorting equipment to attempt to meet the National Sword standards and by developing new market for waste materials both within the US and in other countries including Southeast Asia and India However several countries in Southeast Asia have announced their own restrictions on recycling

The first recorded mass recycling program in the United States Ban The Can was conceived and executed in 1970 by Ruth Pat Webb in Honolulu Hawaii Webb organized military and civilian volunteers to collect over 9 tons 8200kg of metal cans from the roadways and highways of Oahu The metal cans were later recycled into steel reinforcement bars to be used in local construction projects

The Stanolind Recycling Plant was in operation as early 1947 Another early recycling mill was Waste Techniques built in Conshohocken Pennsylvania in 1972 Waste Techniques was sold to Frank Keel in 1978 and resold to BFI in 1981 Woodbury New Jersey was the first city in the United States to mandate recycling Led by Donald Sanderson who was President of Woodbury City Council and Woodbury Recycling Committee in the early 1970s the idea of towing a recycling trailer behind a waste management vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged Other towns and cities soon followed suit and today many cities in the United States make recycling a requirement

In 1987 the Mobro 4000 barge hauled garbage from New York to North Carolina where it was denied It was then sent to Belize where it was denied as well Finally the barge returned to New York and the garbage was incinerated The incident led to heated discussions in the media about waste disposal and recycling The incident is often referred to as igniting the recycling hysteria of the 1990s

Integrating recycling into K12 educational system has become a goal for many educators Usually it is integrated into science or social studies classrooms This is due to its inclusion in the national education standards for both of these subject areas Common areas that recycling is integrated into the curriculum include areas such as the study of natural resources general environmental units soil units water units community units economic units and geography units Although interest is growing major textbook publishers do not always include recycling in a textbook so teachers are left to supplement the textbooks with outside curriculum to meet the national standards For example in a unit about trees or natural resources teachers could include supplemental curriculum about recycling because in the textbook it is never explicitly covered Nonprofit organizations as well as governmental organizations have created supplemental curriculum for teachers to fill this void Some purely nonprofit groups include the Center for a New American Dream and Be SMART Other creators of curriculum include governmental offices Some of these include Oregon California and Waukesha County Wisconsin Also some nonprofit organizations have partnered with sections of the government to collaborate on educational materials For example the Keystone Center partnered with the United States Department of Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory to create curriculum on global warming

America Recycles Day ARD is the only nationally recognized day dedicated to encouraging Americans to recycle and buy recycled products ARD is celebrated annually on November 15 The World Recycling Day celebrated in most countries though falls on July 8 Thousands of events are held across the US to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and to encourage American to sign personal pledges to recycle and buy products made from recycled materials

Started by the recycling sector organization National Recycling Coalition in 1997 America Recycles Day has been a program of national nonprofit Keep America Beautiful since 2009 As the managing entity of America Recycles Day Keep America Beautiful provides promotional and marketing support and resources to a network of local event organizers It is sponsored by private and public entities and the EPA

Although America may not enjoy much of a reputation for environmentalism on the global stage in some US cities recycling levels are much higher than for example in the UK

Bute Shinty Club
Bute Shinty Club is a shinty club from Rothesay Isle of Bute Scotland It has a reserve team which is in South Division Two

The club has been reconstituted on several occasions since its formation in 1906 There was Bute Camanachd and North Bute Shinty Club North Bute competed in the first ever Sutherland Cup final in 1923 The club has existed in its present form since 1946

The club won the Sutherland Cup in 1972 and has won the reintroduced Balliemore Cup on four occasions notably in the first final in 1985 as well as in 2006 when they defeated a Beauly team who held home advantage 2006 was one of the clubs most successful seasons of all time winning South Division One thus gaining promotion to the Premier Division winning the Balliemore Cup and reaching the final of the Celtic Society Cup

In 2008 after several years as a one team club Bute restarted their second team which finished fifth in South Division Two in their first season

The club reached the semifinals of the Camanachd Cup for the first time in 2008

In 2009 they were the last club to finish their season on 12 December 2009 They eventually survived relegation overhauling Lochaber Camanachd with a win against Oban Camanachd

2010 saw Butes period in the Premier Division come to an end with a loss against Oban Camanachd who had been behind the whole season until that last game

Bute romped back into the Premier Division in 2011 with a stunning 100 record in the league as well as winning the Balliemore Cup Bute were relegated in 2012 from a very competitive Premiership

The clubs top player during this successful period has been Hector Whitelaw a full international and a powerful player capable of playing both upfront and at the back He is a prolific goalscorer

The club was one of the main opponents of the national league setup due to the difficulty of traveling to away games in places such as Cannich and Portree Until the establishment of Lewis Camanachd they were the only senior team in Scotland with no fixed link to the mainland

The stepping back of Whitelaw to the second team and the loss of the Zavaroni brothers to Kyles Athletic saw Bute take a step back but they still made good showings in the cups and also made it into the National Division One setup for 2014 with a secondplace finish in Division South One

Several other player changes in 2014 led to a disastrous showing in National Division One even conceding a game at one point Bute finished rock bottom and were due for relegation to South Division One but were given a reprieve due to league reconstruction However Bute elected to be relegated to South Division One feeling that National Division shinty was not feasible for the club at that time In January 2015 former referee Ted McDonald became their senior team coach

<doc id="7709166" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709166" title="Nostos">
Nostos
Nostos Ancient Greek  is a theme used in Ancient Greek literature which includes an epic hero returning home by sea In Ancient Greek society it was deemed a high level of heroism or greatness for those who managed to return This journey is usually very extensive and includes being shipwrecked in an unknown location and going through certain trials that test the hero The return isnt just about returning home physically but also about retaining certain statuses and retaining your identity upon arrival The theme of Nostos is brought to life in Homers The Odyssey where the main hero Odysseus tries to return home after battling in the Trojan War Odysseus is challenged by many temptations such as the Sirens and the Lotuseaters If Odysseus had given into these temptations it would have meant certain death and thus failing to return home Nostos is used today in many forms of literature and movies

In the Odyssey Homer has nostos being the return home from Troy by sea Nostos can be told by those who experienced it themselves or there are simply instances in which it is present Those who told their adventures on the sea on their journey back home from Troy were Menelaus Nestor and Odysseus Those three recount their adventures to others in the epic With Menelaus in Book Four he tells of his time in Egypt and other irregular stops He did not stop at just his nostos but he told of Agamemnons fatal nostos in great detail as well as a small section of Odysseus journey Nestor gives more on Menelaus nostos and his journey home with Odysseus and Menelaus In Book Three Nestor said we pondered our long seavoyage whether we should sail over the top of rocky Chios by the island Psyros keeping it on our left hand or else to pass under Chios by windy Mimas We asked the god to give us some portent for a sign and the god gave us one and told us to cut across the middle main sea for Euboia and so most quickly escape the hovering evil Here Nestor made it evident to the audience that his and Diomedes journey home was a perfect nostos they had no real issues which was quite different from Agamemnons This great difference shows how different each heros journey home could be In these instances where nostos is simply present and not told by the individual in The Odyssey there is an intention to reach a specific destination and some other force blowing the characters off course and arrive in unexpected places on their journey to their homeThe Odyssey had several different instances of nostos One specific instance where Odysseus companions lost their nostos was when they ate Helios cattle and were killed for this since they were specifically told not to Odysseus warned the men when he said Friends since there is food and drink stored in the fast ship let us then keep our hands off the cattle for fear that something may befall us These are the cattle and fat sheep of a dreaded god Helios who sees all things and listens to all things At that point Odysseus warns the men of what will happen if they eat the cattle yet they do anyway This situation took away their nostos because their journey home came to an end

Not all Greek heroes experience nostos Achilles nostos is unique in The Iliad this is because he knows himself that he will not have a nostos creating a greater difference between him and the other heroes such as Odysseus Achilles knows that he has two options when it comes to the Trojan War  he can either die in the battle with glory and have a short life or not participate and live a long yet insignificant life In the ninth book he says my nostos has perished but my kleos will be unwilting In this instance he has chosen the route of glory and says he will not now return home because it is destined that he will die in battle

Odysseus was able to tell his own story of his nostos since he has survived Odysseus was able to tell part of his nostos to the Phaeacians and the length of his journey shows how difficult it can be to achieve nostos This arrival and telling of his tales is a big deal though he has not reached home it is a huge mile marker After Odysseus and his companions leave Circes palace safely his crew members show their happiness by saying we rejoice for you saved yourself nourished by Zeus as much as if we had reached Ithaca which shows the comparison of escaping to returning home

Nostos meant several different things in this epic it meant escaping death safe landings returning home from war and being back home All of those come through because as the hero returned from war the idea of escaping death from war remained in their forethought These meanings all resemble nostos and when heroes are on their journey back they will have the ultimate Kleos once they have arrived and that is celebrated

The word nostalgia was first coined as a medical term in 1688 by Johannes Hofer 16691752 a Swiss medical student It uses the word  along with another Greek root  or algos meaning pain to describe the psychological condition of longing for the past 
In James Joyces Ulysses the final part episodes 1618 during which Leopold Bloom returns home is called the Nostos

Another depiction of nostos in contemporary media would be the example of the movie Hercules Unchained which was released in 1959 This movie was similar to the Odyssey Hercules journey was very similar to Odysseus One specific instance being when Hercules returned home with Iole whom he won in an archery contest which is similar to Odysseus contest to save his marriage He was accidentally poisoned by his wife and asked to have his body set on fire Having his body set on fire is what led to his many heroic achievements

During that time period there were no other films like this one that depicted this type of ancient material Hercules nostos had him die and then be reborn this is to rediscover his identity within himself and the community This is similar to Odysseus because he transforms personally from a war machine to a family man

The TV series  in which the titular spacecraft is stranded 70000 lightyears from Earth and encounters numerous hostile and friendly aliens and strange phenomena on its way home has been described by classicists as a nostos

Anglique instrument
The anglique French from Italian angelica is a plucked string instrument of the lute family of the baroque era It combines features of the lute the harp and the theorbo

It shares the form of its pear shaped body as well as its vibrating string length of 54 to 70cm with the lute Differing from the lute the 16 string angelica was singlestrung like a theorbo with which it shares its extended neck with a second peg box bearing six bass strings

The angelica was tuned diatonically like a harp C  E  F  G  A  B  c  d  e  f  g  a  b  c  d  e That range is the same as that of the French or lesser theorbo but the latter differs in that its tuning is reentrant C  D  E  F  G  A  B  c  d  g  c  e a  d The diatonic tuning limited its compass but produced a full and clear tone by the increased use of open strings

Little surviving music for the angelica as well as few surviving instruments indicate that the angelica flourished during the second half of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries

Some authors claim that the angelica was invented in England But that claim is based on the misinterpretation of its name M H Fuhrmann Musicalischer Trichter FrankfurtSpree 1706 p 91 James Talbot correctly interpreted angelica as angel lute because of its lovely sound ms Oxford 532 16851701 

Music for the angelica is notated in French tablature with the designation of bass courses varying according to respective authors 

The Ukrainian Torban is a descendant of the Anglique

After the breakup of the Soviet Union there were two time zones in Uzbekistan In the Soviet era most time zones were daylight time in the winter and double daylight time in the summer The western part of the country observed Samarkand Time 5 or 6 hours ahead of UTC The eastern part observed Tashkent Time 6 or 7 hours ahead of UTC In 1991 the clocks did not move forward in the spring to maintain single daylight time only in the summer That fall a unified time zone was adopted 5 hours ahead of UTC

Excitation filter
An excitation filter is a high quality opticalglass filter commonly used in fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopic applications for selection of the excitation wavelength of light from a light source Most excitation filters select light of relatively short wavelengths from an excitation light source as only those wavelengths would carry enough energy to cause the object the microscope is examining to fluoresce sufficiently The excitation filters used may come in two main types  short pass filters and band pass filters Variations of these filters exist in the form of notch filters or deep blocking filters commonly employed as emission filters Other forms of excitation filters include the use of monochromators wedge prisms coupled with a narrow slit for selection of the excitation light and the use of holographic diffraction gratings etc for beam diffraction of white laser light into the required excitation wavelength selected for by a narrow slit

An excitation filter is commonly packaged with an emission filter and a dichroic beam splitter in a cube so that the group is inserted together into the microscope The dichroic beam splitter controls which wavelengths of light go to their respective filter

Posterity of Heaven
Posterity of Heaven or Cheonson   designates the Korean people because they are considered the descendants of Heaven or the heavenly god Based on historical records the ancient Koreans generally worshiped the heavens and the sun liked brightness and considered their states governed by Heaven

Because the thought about the Posterity of Heaven an archaic word says that the peoples mind is equal to the Heavens mind which warns rulers of the significance of the people The Korean national anthem Aegukga supports this concept The lyrics of Aegukga say May our nation be eternal by the protection and help of Heaven In addition the National Foundation Day Gaecheonjeol literally means the day when the sky was opened It is natural that the sky should be opened for the Posterity of Heaven to found a nation

In very ancient times there were a divine regent who had supervised and taught the people as a representative of the Heavenly God These divine regents were called Hwanin Hwanung and Dangun based on the period


Korean kingdoms had used both titles of kings and emperors as the title of rulers because they thought that the highest rulers was Heaven and all rulers must be a representative of Heaven This concept of the Posterity of Heaven is somewhat different from the Chinese concept of the Son of Heaven It is believed that the Chinese emperor governs the Chinese as the son of Heaven But the Koreans believe that they themselves are the descendants of Heaven the Heavenly God governs them by himself and a ruler of a nation is nothing but the supervisor as a representative of Heaven

Because of the Koreans thought about Heavenly offspring they have had an anniversary sacrifice month is as lunar calendar Scholars say that dolmen in Manchuria and Korean Peninsula was an altar to sacrifice to Heaven

Michael Agerskov
Michael Agerskov 18701933 was a Danish spiritualist teacher and author best known for his book Toward the Light which he coauthored with his wife Johanne Agerskov Agerskovs literary production includes poems novels and also schoolbooks for the primary school and the secondary school in Denmark Together with Erling Rrdam he also wrote a reader published several times during 1904 and 1933 and also translated into Swedish

In the first decade of the last century Michael Agerskov became interested in spiritistic phenomena and participated in spiritistic sances together with his wife and he also produced several poems by the means of what was called automatic writing the hand writing down the thoughts of a discarnated spirit Many of these poems were made public It soon became obvious that Johanne Agerskov was an intermediary and they formed a circle together with two other couples and held sances because they were told that they before their incarnation had promised to take on the task of being the instrumental to bring to mankind some truths from the transcendental world Johanne Agerskov had the unique ability to close off her own thoughts and to intuitively receive the thoughts of the spirits that contacted her The other participants were called on to form questions on which the spirits gave the answers which were then written down This work continued for several years and resulted in the publishing of the ethicreligious philosophic and scientific book Toward the Light and to several other books concerning the same issues 

Michael Agerskov was the publisher of all the books along with his work as a teacher censor and author of his own literary works Toward the Light was distributed to all the bishops and to 60 ministers of the Danish church and the Agerskovs hope and intention was the Danish church to go through a reformation on the basis of the information given in Toward the Light with the participation of the bishops and the ministers But even though Toward the Light had many followers among the common people the church did not react and the book did not lead to a public interest to any extent 

Even though Michael and Johanne Agerskov had participated in spiritistic sances they soon urged the spiritists to end their activities In Toward the Light there is very clearly stated that the spirits of the dead human beings are not allowed to visit the earth because they need to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation Only if we are called upon by the spirits of the light we should react to their calling

After many requests Michael Agerskov in 1922 wrote the story about the extraordinary events that had led to the publishing of Toward the Light in the book Some Psychic Experiences

In 1928 Michael Agerskov had a serious attack of influenza and as a repercussion of the illness he developed a serious condition of increasing paralysis of the muscles and he had to end his work as a teacher In 1932 he was so weak that he could not cross the floor of their living room by his own means and soon after the condition also involved the heart muscle He died in 1933

Johanne Agerskov
Johanne Elisabeth Agerskov 18731946 was a Danish medium Together with her husband Michael Agerskov she was responsible for the ethicoreligious philosophical and pseudoscientific book Toward the Light in Danish Vandrer mod Lyset first published by Michael Agerskov in Copenhagen in 1920

She was a daughter of a Dutch inventor minister and principal of the Royal Institute for DeafMutes in Copenhagen Rasmus MallingHansen  1835  1890 

In her younger days Johanne Agerskov worked as a teacher and she married Michael Agerskov in 1899 Their only daughter Inger Agerskov was born in 1900 and Johanne became a housewife 

During the first decade of the twentieth century Michael became interested in spiritual phenomena and persuaded his wife to participate in sances even though she was skeptical in the beginning Soon Johanne came to believe that the spirits of the transcendental world had called upon her and had given her the message that she was a medium and that before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing eternal truths to mankind

Convinced that she had a special mission Agerskov and her husband formed a circle with two more couples and for many years held weekly sances in which they believed messages from the spirits of the light were given to Agerskov through intuitive thoughtinspiration She claimed a unique ability to close off her own thoughts so that all she could hear in her mind according to her was the thoughts of the spirit with whom she was supposed to be in contact That was very demanding and in that period she gave up all the pleasures of social life in order to be focused and prepared for the sances The members of the circle would submit questions for her to ask the spirits and shortly she would give them answers supposedly from the spirits which the other participants would write down

That resulted in the publication of the book Toward the Light which Agerskov called a message to mankind from the transcendental world and which she and her husband sent out to all the bishops and sixty ministers of the Danish national church Their hope was that these would participate in a reformation of the Danish church based upon the new knowledge given in Toward the Light The Agerskovs made great efforts to that end through correspondence and by opening their home to anybody who wanted to see them about Toward the Light but there was little public interest in the book and the expected reformation did not take place

Johanne Agerskov was also deeply engaged in the work of her father In 1924 a Danish professor asserted that MallingHansen was not the inventor of the Hansen Writing Ball and Agerskov undertook a thorough investigation of the facts together with her sister Engelke Wiberg They wrote several articles on the subject and Agerskov also wrote a book called Hvem var Skrivekuglens Opfinder Who was the Inventor of the Writing Ball published in Copenhagen in 1925

In 1926 a Society for the Advancement of Toward the Light was formed  which offered religious services for its members based on Toward the Light Agerskov was skeptical however because Toward the Light calls on believers to remain in the established church and to work for reformation from within

Even though the Agerskovs in the beginning had participated in spiritualist sances they soon asked their followers to end that activity because as they asserted in Toward the Light calling on the spirits of deceased ancestors would bring problems to those who could not resist the call to appear The spirits they said needed to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation and were not allowed to visit the earth

Michael Agerskov died in 1933 but Johanne continued to answer letters and to publish up until 1938 in collaboration with their daughter During the last years of her life Johanne Agerskov suffered from illness and was not able to leave her home

There has been controversy among Agerskovs followers over whether or not to publish photos of her as she said to destroy all her own pictures of herself before she died Some of the followers of Toward the Light contend that her will in this matter should be respected and oppose the publication of such pictures

Others see nothing wrong with publishing photos of her considering that photos of her are available in public collections in both Denmark and Norway and on the WorldWide Web This article contains photos of both Agerskov and her husband supplied by their descendants who have no objection to their publication

In architecture and masonry the term setoff is given to the horizontal line shown on a floorplan indicating a reduced wall thickness and consequently the part of the thicker portion appears projecting before the thinner In plinths this is generally simply chamfered In other parts of stonework the setoff is generally concealed by a projecting stringer Where as in parapets the upper part projects is proud of the lower the break is generally hid by a corbel watertable The portions of buttress caps which recede one behind another are also called setsoff

<doc id="7709451" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709451" title="Setoff law">
Setoff law
In law setoff or netting are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities replacing gross positions with net positions It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a plaintiff and a respondent The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single net claim The net claim is known as a net position In other words a setoff is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor In bookkeeping terms setoffs are also known as reconciliations To determine a setoff simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger 

Any balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off The power of net positions is to reduce credit exposure also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages which contributes to market stability In regard to the financial market net positions are vital

Whilst netting and set off are often used interchangeably the legal distinction is made between netting which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a set off By contrast set off describes the legal bases for producing net positions Netting describes the form such as novation netting or closeout netting whilst set off describes judicially recognised grounds such as independent set off or insolvency set off Therefore a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counterparty to address counterparty credit risk This is to be differentiated from hedging which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk

The law does not permit counterparties to use third party debt to set off against an unrelated liability All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out primarily by ensuring that a nonowner cannot benefit from insolvency

The primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties This prevents credit risk exposure and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherrypicking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company 

At least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market specifically credit risk

Also called rolling netting netting by novation involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims

This differs from settlement netting outlined below because the fusion of both claims into one producing a single balance occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract This method of netting is crucial in financial settings particularly derivatives transactions as it avoids cherrypicking in insolvency The effectiveness of preinsolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France1975 1 WLR 758 Similar to settlement netting novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date This means that if in the above example transaction2 was to be paid on Friday the two transactions would not offset Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due

An effective closeout netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by ISDA These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency In the event of counterparty bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated ie effected all transactions or all of a given type are netted ie set off against each other at market value or if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the nondefaulting party in replacing the relevant contract The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to and thus potentially cherry pick There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested
The key elements of close out netting are
Similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such asrepos forwards or options The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively Other systemic challenges to netting such as regulatory capital recognition under Basel II and other Insolvencyrelated matters seen in the Lamfalussy Report has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform In England  Wales the effect of British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France has largely been negated by Part VII of the Company Act 1989 which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts In regard to the BASEL Accords the first set of guidelines BASEL I was missing guidelines on netting BASEL II introduced netting guidelines

For cash settled trades this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions
Obligations are not modified under settlement netting which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged Unlike closeout netting settlement netting is only possible in relation to likeobligations having the same settlement date These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency but can be agreed in advance Claims exist but are extinguished when paid To achieve simultaneously payment only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned British Eagle These are routinely included within derivative transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the presettlement exposure amount 

Set off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted Of these legal bases a common form is the legal defense of setoff which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person Party A who owed money to another Party B could be sent to debtors prison despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court This operated as an equitable shield but not a sword Upon judgment both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing eg If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105 the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A Setoff can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that where a party defaults the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished

In certain jurisdictions including the UK certain types of setoff takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a company This means that for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company mutual debts are setoff against each other and then either the bankrupts creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid depending on which side owed the most The primary argument This has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu The alternative where a creditor has to pay all its debts but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get poses the danger of knockon insolvencies and thus a systemic market risk Seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of setoff First the law should uphold preinsolvency autonomy and setoffs as parties invariably rely on the preinsolvency commitments This is a core policy point Second as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs Third managing risk particularly systemic risk is crucially Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out Effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts Can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation 

The right to set off is particularly important when a banks exposures are reported to regulatory authorities as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors is thus replaced The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent less the value of the security taken

Two primary examples of setoff rules are outlined below These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives 

Under English law there are broadly five types of setoff which have been recognised

The five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term It is an essential aspect for crossclaims especially when there exits overlapping obligations Common features of setoff are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality

See De Magno v United States 636 F2d 714 727 DC Cir 1980 district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VAs affirmative 
action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its commonlaw right of setoff discussing similar language of predecessor statute 38 USC  211

See eg United States v Munsey Trust Co 332 US 234 239 67 SCt 1599 1601 91 LEd 2022 1947 government has the same right which belongs to every creditor to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor in his hands in extinguishment of the debts due to him  quoting Gratiot v United States 40 US 15 Pet 336 370 10 LEd 759 1841 see also Tatelbaum v United States 10 ClCt 207 210 1986 setoff right is inherent in the United States government and grounded on common law right of every creditor to set off debts

University shinty
In the sport of shinty there are several clubs which play under the banner of one of the Scottish universities However these clubs are not always student teams in the strictest sense of the word and have a long history of participation at national senior level Since the introduction of a summer season only the Aberdeen University Shinty Club continues to play in the senior leagues although Edinburgh Glasgow and St Andrews have all done so in the past

Scottish universities have played a major role in shinty since the early days of the sport The University of Aberdeen club was founded in 1861 and clubs were founded at universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow in the late Victorian era Aberdeen played in North competitions and Edinburgh and Glasgow competed in South competitions Often these teams would compete in Junior competitions but would also from time to time restrict themselves to the University Littlejohn competition

University of St Andrews became the fourth and final team to enter league shinty in the late 1960s This meant that all four of Scotlands ancient universities had a shinty team representing them The original three had varying degrees of success but won or appeared in the finals of several cup competitions as well as garnering league success throughout their league existence

The Littlejohn of Invercharron Vase is the trophy played for by the universities It was presented in 1905 and has been played for ever since 

The move to the summer season in the sport meant that of the four teams playing in the north and south leagues only the University of Aberdeen continued to play on a fulltime basis

However the change in status means that players from clubs playing in the National Leagues such as Kingussie and Fort William can now play for their university outwith the senior season Previously these players could only compete in the annual oneday Littlejohn Vase tournament They may now play in the winter University League

The Scottish Universities also have a representative side which currently plays against the British Universities GAA in Composite rules ShintyHurling annually

There are seven teams entering the University Shinty League for the 201011 season these are Aberdeen Dundee Edinburgh Glasgow RGU Robert Gordon University St Andrews and Strathclyde This season saw the demise of UHI with many teams sighing in relief The mens league is currently being led by a rejuvenated Glasgow side with their female counterpart making a strong start to their season after many years playing under the banner of Strathclyde

The sport of shinty as a whole has benefited greatly from its presence in universities Many alumni have gone onto play a role in reviving or reinvigorating the sport in their home area or the area in which they have settled after graduation including Skye Lewis London Cornwall and Caithness Many players have retained their links with the sport when otherwise they would have drifted away in the urban area

For the article about the senior side of the same name see Aberdeen University Shinty Club

This club is the successor to the University of Aberdeen side which continued in the senior leagues with the advent of summer shinty in 2004 The two clubs maintain a symbiotic relationship by having the players from the senior team helping with training Although nonstudents can play for the senior side only students can play for the students side Aberdeen University welcome all players from all levels to train and play and are well known for giving people who have never played shinty a taste and help them develop into shinty players See the senior side article for more information on the history of the club

See Edinburgh University Shinty Club for more information

The second oldest University club founded in 1891 Edinburgh has since 2011 become a force in the University sport winning three Littlejohns in 2012 2013 and 2014 This brought to end an almost thirtyyear drought

See Glasgow University Shinty Club for more information

One of the historically successful clubs Glasgow University has failed to achieve success since winning South Division Two in 2003 and the advent of summer shinty

See St Andrews University Shinty Club

Teams representing the University of Strathclyde had been competing in the Littlejohn Vase since the early 1990s Most matriculated students who did not play for their home club tended to play for Glasgow University in the senior leagues Despite being able to draw upon a good base of players and perhaps hampered by a lack of familiarity which other universities had from playing regularly together Strathclyde did not win the Littlejohn until in 2005 when they also won the first official University league They reached the final in 2006 when they lost to Robert Gordon However Strathclyde once again won the trophy in 2007 which saw them defeat Dundee University 20 in the final

The Strathclyde team have been the strongest force in University shinty in the late 2000s with players from the Premier Division and North Division One making up the entirety of their team They appeared in five straight Littlejohn finals equalling the record of bitter rivals Glasgow University
Robert Gordon University was started by shinty players such as Davie Trout Roberston in the 1990s but became a force in University shinty when Glenurquhart Shinty Clubs John Barr who made RGU a tough proposition for any team especially in Aberdeen played for the University

RGU won the Littlejohn in 2004 2006 2009 and 2010 The University also runs a ladies team which featured Eilidh Middleton an international Equestrianist It also depends on many Irish students with a background in Hurling

Dundee University Shinty Club is a shinty club from the city of Dundee founded in 2004 Its mens and womens teams are representing University of Dundee in University Shinty league and at numerous tournaments throughout the year The club have performed rapidly since formation winning the SUSF now SSS University league in 200607 and also reaching the final of the Littlejohn Vase tournament in 2006 The current mens team captain is Hamish Duff

The womens team was established in 2013 and officially entered University Shinty league prior to 201415 season They also compete in the same tournaments throughout the year as the mens team The current womens team captain is Kirsty Fraser

University of Abertay Dundee have the distinction of having won every Littlejohn they have competed in having only competed in one to this point in 2003 defeating Glasgow University in the final 21 They have failed to make an appearance at any Littlejohn since They have a sixes team which plays infrequently

The UHI Millennium Institute which is a collection of various colleges from across the Scottish Highlands and Islands entered a team in the University Shinty League for the first time in 2008 As the UHI has institutions in areas such as Invernessshire and Lochaber they can draw on a strong pool of players By 2011 however UHI had folded the difficulty in fulfilling midweek fixtures for a team made up mostly of tradesmen spread across the Highlands was a contributory factor

Its Only Rock amp Roll Waylon Jennings album
Its Only Rock  Roll is an album by Waylon Jennings released on RCA Victor in 1983

Jennings who had been a mainstay on at the top of the country charts for most of the previous decade began a commercial slide with Its Only Rock  Roll The LP which Jennings produced with Randy Scruggs did produce a number 1 hit a cover of Little Richards rock and roll classic Lucille You Wont Do Your Daddys Will his twelfth number 1 since 1974 Jennings would not top the singles chart again until 1987 The single Breakin Down also made the Top 10 Jennings contributed two songs for the LP Let Her Do the Walking which he wrote himself and the reflective No Middle Ground which he composed with Gary Scruggs Songwriter Rodney Crowell who had written Jennings number 1 song I Aint Living Long Like This and had become one of the singers favorite writers has two songwriting credits including the title track and the ballad Angel Eyes Jennings wife Jessi Colter Marcia Beverly and Jerry Gropp provide harmony vocals on the LP

Understandably considering his condition at the time Jennings was not fond of his work during this period I was doing bad records Missing shows due to laryngitis Not picking up the guitar unless I was getting paid Not caring

Its Only Rock  Roll peaked at number 10 on the Billboard country albums chart Jennings worst showing since Honky Tonk Heroes in 1973

Crispin Sartwell of Record was dismissive of the albums closing medley saying that all of its material had been done far better on other albums but asserted that every other track on Its Only Rock  Roll is oldfashioned kickbutt country and rock He especially praised Jenningss rendition of Lucille for its simplicity and straightforwardness

Jim Worbois of AllMusics brief retrospective review read While many labels were raiding their vaults to create medley records of artists no longer signed with them  Jennings seems to have done it to himself There are a couple nice songs on here but its not one of his best

Edinburgh University Shinty Club
Edinburgh University Shinty Club is one of the oldest shinty clubs in existence having been founded in 1891 The club which represents the University of Edinburgh has both male and female team sides with players coming from other further and higher education establishments in the city including Heriot Watt University Edinburgh Napier and Edinburgh College Whilst formally a University Shinty team the club has a long history of playing at national level

The period 1927 to 1933 is the most notable in the clubs history with the university retaining the Littlejohn Vase for six years in succession In those days the team was also competing in the Southern League and the Camanachd Cup

The team was once so strong it fielded a second string after the Second World War

Through the 1960s and 1970s the club remained strong In the 1980s the club competed in Division Three South save for one regrettable year of isolation when fixtures were provided by the Littlejohn Vase Such a period shows how a University teams fortunes can fluctuate as the season 198687 saw the team narrowly miss promotion 198788 saw relegation to Division Four

In 1991 the club enjoyed its centenary year in which a grand reunion was organised Guests of honour included Sorley MacLean who played for the club in the late twenties

In 2004 the club played its last games of senior shinty with the advent of summer shinty meaning that the university could not field a team through the summer months Players now return to their hometown teams or will play for local sides Tayforth Camanachd and Aberdour Shinty Club

2011 saw a transition period for the club and the resurrection of the yearly challenge match with Trinity College where the Scottish and Irish capital sides play each other at the start of the year in a shintyhurling match The trip in 2011 proved so successful that a yearly tour to Dublin is now undertaken and eagerly anticipated A friendship was formed with St Judes GAA in 2012 where the club travelled to Templeogue for a shintyhurling challenge match The club shall now play St Judes and Trinity in alternate years in the Irish capital alongside St Brigids

The successful ladies side of the 2000s was instrumental in the foundation of Forth Camanachd and subsequent developments in ladies shinty in the area with many transferring to Aberdour when Forth folded

In 2012 the club won the Littlejohn for the first time in 26 years defeating Glasgow University 10 in the final The club won the Littlejohn again in 2013 where they defeated rivals Strathclyde University 10 in the final at St Andrews They repeated the feat in 2014 and 2019

Glasgow University Shinty Club
Glasgow University Shinty Club is a shinty club from Glasgow Scotland Although formally a University Shinty team representing the University of Glasgow it has a long history of competition in national competition

Founded in 1901 by Angus MacVicar Murdo Mackenzie and Murdo MacRae with MacVicar as the first team captain It entered League competition between 1906 and 1908 and played on the pitch of the Glasgow Skye Shinty Club until 1909 after which it played at the Glasgow Cowal Club pitch at Possilpark Glasgow The Club became affiliated to the Glasgow University Sports Association in 1911 Throughout the years the club has also been very strong in University competition its glory years being in the late 1950s and 1960s when they won the southern league and the Littlejohn three years in a row Throughout the latter half of the clubs existence from the late 1940s until his death in 2015 Jack Asher who latterly was honorary president attended games and supported the club The club organises an annual 6 aside tournament in his memory

The club struggled in the 1980s although they had reached the final of the Sutherland Cup in 1981 but the late 1990s saw a renaissance in the team the club appearing in 5 Littlejohn finals in a row winning the trophy twice and the clubs final season in 2003 in the south leagues saw them win South Division Two undefeated However the switch to a summer season in shinty resulted in the University leaving the league setup Their last senior fixture was a Glasgow Celtic Society Cup match against Tayforth in the spring of 2004

Since 2004 amid the advent of summer shinty the clubs fortunes suffered a downturn on the park although membership stayed steady Glasgow failed to reach a Littlejohn final or challenge for the league between 2005 and 2010 as an exceptionally strong Strathclyde side swept all before them However 2011 saw a rejuvenated Glasgow leading the University league and reach the Littlejohn Final for the first time since 2004 The club reached the final again in 2012 but they were thwarted by Edinburgh who won their first trophy in 26 years Glasgows drought now lasting since 2002 In 2015 the club won the University league notably completing the double over a Strathclyde team that went on to win the Littlejohn that year

The club has one of the shortest pitches in shinty and was one of the first clubs to make effective use of the internet as a recruiting tool The club is also a major force for promoting shinty through Gaelic the team also known in Scots Gaelic as An tr is Dubh the Gold and Blacks

In the Western Christian practice the liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October All Hallows Eve All Saints Eve and ends at the close of 1 November It is thus the day before All Souls Day which commemorates the faithful departed In many traditions All Saints Day is part of the season of Allhallowtide which includes the three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive and in some denominations such as Anglicanism extends to Remembrance Sunday On All Saints Day it is common for families to attend church as well as visit cemeteries in order to lay flowers and candles on the graves of their deceased loved ones In Austria and Germany godparents gift their godchildren Allerheiligenstriezel All Saints Braid on All Saints Day while the practice of souling remains popular in Portugal It is a national holiday in many historically Christian countries

The Christian celebration of All Saints Day and All Souls Day stems from a belief that there is a powerful spiritual bond between those in heaven the Church triumphant and the living the Church militant In Catholic theology the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in Heaven In Methodist theology All Saints Day revolves around giving God solemn thanks for the lives and deaths of his saints including those who are famous or obscure As such individuals throughout the Church Universal are honoured such as Paul the Apostle Augustine of Hippo and John Wesley in addition to individuals who have personally led one to faith in Jesus such as ones grandmother or friend

In the British Isles it is known that churches were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century to coincide with or replace the Celtic festival of Samhain
James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead Samhain However Ronald Hutton points out that according to engus of Tallaght d ca 824 the 7th8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April He suggests that 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea

The Eastern Orthodox Church following the Byzantine tradition commemorates all saints collectively on the first Sunday after Pentecost All Saints Sunday Greek   Agin Pantn

The feast of All Saints achieved great prominence in the 9th century in the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise 866911 His wife Empress Theophano  commemorated on 16 December  lived a devout life After her death in 893 her husband built a church intending to dedicate it to her When he was forbidden to do so he decided to dedicate it to All Saints so that if his wife were in fact one of the righteous she would also be honoured whenever the feast was celebrated According to tradition it was Leo who expanded the feast from a commemoration of All Martyrs to a general commemoration of All Saints whether martyrs or not

This Sunday marks the close of the Paschal season To the normal Sunday services are added special scriptural readings and hymns to all the saints known and unknown from the Pentecostarion

In the late spring the Sunday following Pentecost Saturday 50 days after Easter is set aside as a commemoration of all locally venerated saints such as All Saints of America All Saints of Mount Athos etc The third Sunday after Pentecost may be observed for even more localised saints such as All Saints of St Petersburg or for saints of a particular type such as New Martyrs of the Turkish Yoke

In addition to the Mondays mentioned above Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the Octoechos

The celebration of 1 November in Lebanon as a holiday is simply the influence of Western Catholic orders present in Lebanon and is not Maronite in origin The traditional Maronite feast equivalent to the honor of all saints in their liturgical calendar is one of three Sundays in preparation for Lent called the Sunday of the Righteous and the Just The following Sunday is the Sunday of the Faithful Departed similar to All Souls Day in Western calendar

In East Syriac tradition the All Saints Day celebration falls on the first Friday after resurrection Sunday This is because all departed faithful are saved by the blood of Jesus and they resurrected with the Christ Normally in east Syriac liturgy the departed souls are remembered on Friday Church celebrates All souls day on Friday before the beginning of Great lent or Great Fast

The Christian holiday of All Saints Day falls on 1 November followed by All Souls Day on 2 November and is currently a Solemnity in the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church a Festival in the Lutheran Churches as well as a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communion

In the early days the Christians were accustomed to solemnise the anniversary of a martyrs death for Christ at the place of martyrdom In the 4th century neighbouring dioceses began to interchange feasts to transfer relics to divide them and to join in a common feast as is shown by the invitation of St Basil of Caesarea 397 to the bishops of the province of Pontus In the persecution of Diocletian the number of martyrs became so great that a separate day could not be assigned to each But the Church feeling that every martyr should be venerated appointed a common day for all The first trace of this we find in Antioch on the Sunday after Pentecost We also find mention of a common day in a sermon of St Ephrem the Syrian 373 and in the 74th homily of St John Chrysostom 407 According to Ephrem this feast was observed at Edessa on 13 May and John Chrysostom says it was on the Sunday after Pentecost in Constantinople As early as 411 there is in the Chaldean Calendar a Commemoratio Confessorum for the Friday after Easter

On 13 May 609 or 610 Pope Boniface IV consecrated the Pantheon at Rome to the Blessed Virgin and all the martyrs ordering an anniversary the feast of the dedication Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres has been celebrated at Rome ever since There is evidence that from the 5th to the 7th centuries there existed in certain places and at sporadic intervals a feast date on 13 May to celebrate the holy martyrs The origin of All Saints Day cannot be traced with certainty and it has been observed on various days in different places However there are some who maintain the belief that it has origins in the pagan observation of 13 May the Feast of the Lemures in which the malevolent and restless spirits of the dead were propitiated Some liturgiologists base the idea that this Lemuria festival was the origin of that of All Saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of all the dead Meanwhile others consider that 13 May was perhaps deliberately chosen by the Pope because of its celebration already established in the East

The feast of All Saints on its current date is traced to the foundation by Pope Gregory III 731741 of an oratory in St Peters for the relics of the holy apostles and of all saints martyrs and confessors of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world with the date moved to 1 November and 13 May feast suppressed

This fell on the Celtic holiday of Samhain which had a theme similar to the Roman festival of Lemuria but which was also a harvest festival The Irish having celebrated Samhain in the past did not celebrate All Hallows Day on this 1 November date as extant historical documents attest that the celebration in Ireland took place in the spring  the Felire of Oengus and the Martyrology of Tallaght prove that the early medieval churches in Ireland celebrated the feast of All Saints on 20 April

A November festival of all the saints was already widely celebrated on 1 November in the days of Charlemagne It was made a day of obligation throughout the Frankish empire in 835 by a decree of Louis the Pious issued at the instance of Pope Gregory IV and with the assent of all the bishops which confirmed its celebration on 1 November The octave was added by Pope Sixtus IV 14711484

The festival was retained after the Reformation in the calendar of the Anglican Church and in many Lutheran churches In the Lutheran churches such as the Church of Sweden it assumes a role of general commemoration of the dead In the Swedish calendar the observance takes place on the Saturday between 31 October and 6 November In many Lutheran Churches it is moved to the first Sunday of November In the Church of England mother church of the Anglican Communion it is a Principal Feast and may be celebrated either on 1 November or on the Sunday between 30 October and 5 November It is also celebrated by other Protestants of the English tradition such as the United Church of Canada the Methodist churches and the Wesleyan Church

Protestants disagree with the idea of saints as understood in the Roman Catholic tradition and generally commemorate all Christians on All Saints Day if they observe All Saints Day at all they use it to remember all Christians both past and present In the United Methodist Church All Saints Day is celebrated on the first Sunday in November It is held not only to remember Saints but also to remember all those who have died who were members of the local church congregation In some congregations a candle is lit by the Acolyte as each persons name is called out by the clergy Prayers and responsive readings may accompany the event Often the names of those who have died in the past year are affixed to a memorial plaque

In many Lutheran churches All Saints Day is celebrated the Sunday after Reformation is celebrated the date for Reformation is 31 October so Reformation Sunday is celebrated on or before 31 October In most congregations the festival is marked as an occasion to remember the dead The names of those who have died from the congregation within the last year are read during worship and a bell is tolled a chime is played or a candle is lit for each name read While the dead are solemnly remembered during worship on All Saints Sunday the festival is ultimately a celebration of Christs victory over death

In Englishspeaking countries services often include the singing of the traditional hymn For All the Saints by Walsham How The most familiar tune for this hymn is Sine Nomine by Ralph Vaughan Williams Other hymns that are popularly sung during corporate worship on this day are I Sing a Song of the Saints of God and Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones

In some countries All Saints Day is a public holiday but All Souls Day is not Consequently people will visit the cemetery on All Saints In Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia the Czech Republic Finland Catholic parts of Germany Hungary Italy Lithuania Macedonia Moldova Poland Romania Slovakia Slovenia Serbia and Sweden the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives

In Austria and Bavaria it is customary on All Saints Day for godfathers to give their godchildren Allerheiligenstriezel a braided yeast pastry

In France and throughout the Francophone world the day is known as La Toussaint Flowers especially in Chrysanthemums or wreaths called couronnes de toussaints are placed at each tomb or grave The following day 2 November All Souls Day is called Le jour des morts the Day of the Dead In Belgium Toussaint is a public holiday Belgians will visit the cemetery to place chrysanthemums on the graves of deceased relatives on All Saints Day since All Souls is not a holiday

In Portugal Dia de Todos os Santos is a national holiday Families remember their dead with religious observances and visits to the cemetery Portuguese children celebrate the PoporDeus tradition also called santorinho bolinho or fiis de Deus going doortodoor where they receive cakes nuts pomegranates sweets and candies

In Spain el Da de Todos los Santos is a national holiday The play Don Juan Tenorio is traditionally performed

In Argentina Bolivia Chile Peru Puerto Rico Uruguay and the state of Louisiana people take flowers to the graves of dead relatives 

All Saints Day in Mexico coincides with the first day of the Day of the Dead Da de Muertos celebration It commemorates children who have died Dia de los Inocentes and the second day celebrates all deceased adults

In Guatemala All Saints Day is a national holiday On that day Guatemalans make a special meal called fiambre which is made of cold meats and vegetables it is customary to visit cemeteries and to leave some of the fiambre for their dead It is also customary to fly kites to help unite the dead with the living There are festivals in towns like Santiago Sacatepquez and Sumpango where giant colorful kites are flown

Hallowmas in the Philippines is variously called Unds Todos los Santos Spanish All Saints and sometimes Araw ng mga Patay  Yumao Tagalog Day of the dead  those who have passed away which actually refers to the following day of All Souls Day but includes it Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead to clean and repair their tombs Offerings of prayers flowers candles and even food while Chinese Filipinos additionally burn incense and kim Many also spend the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the cemetery having feasts and merriment

Though Halloween has usually been seen as an American influence in the Philippines the countrys trickortreat traditions during Undas from the Spanish Hondras are actually much older This tradition was derived from the precolonial tradition called pangangaluwa Pangangaluluwa from kaluluwa or spirit double was a practice of early Filipinos who sang from house to house swathed in blankets pretending to be ghosts of ancestors If the owner of the house failed to give biko or rice cakes to the nangangaluluwa the spirits would play tricks try to steal slippers or other objects left outside the house by members of the family or run off with the owners chickens This precolonial practice is still seen in rural areas During Undas family members visit the cemetery where the body of the loved ones rest It is believed that by going to the cemetery and offering food candles flowers and sometimes incense sticks the spirit of the loved one is remembered and appeased Contrary to common belief this visitation practice is not an imported tradition Prior to the establishment of coffins precolonial Filipinos were already practicing such a tradition of visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago as confirmed by a research conducted by the University of the Philippines The tradition of atang or hain is also practiced where food and other offerings are placed near the grave site If the family cannot go to the grave site a specific area in the house is provided for the offering The exact date of Undas today 1 November is not a precolonial observance date but an influence from Mexico where the same day is known as the Day of the Dead Precolonial Filipinos preferred going to the burial caves of the departed occasionally as they believed that aswang halfvampire halfwerewolf beings would take the corpse of the dead if the body was not properly guarded The protection of the body of the loved one is called paglalamay However in some communities this paglalamay tradition is nonexistent and is replaced by other precolonial traditions unique to each community The Undas is also seen as a family reunion where family members coming from various regions go back to their hometown to visit the grave of loved ones Family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire day and socialize with each other to mend bonds and enhance family relations In some cases family members going to certain burial sites exceed one hundred people Fighting in any form is prohibited during Undas Children have important roles during Undas Children are allowed to play with melted candles in front of grave sites and turn the melted wax from the candles into round wax balls The round balls of wax symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began as the living will go back to ash where everything started In some cases families also light candles at the front door of the home The number of candles is equivalent to the number of departed loved ones It is believed that this tradition aids departed loved ones and provide them with a happy path to the afterlife

Guam Highway 1
Guam Highway 1 GH1 also known as Marine Corps Drive is one of the primary automobile routes in the United States territory of Guam It runs in a southwesttonortheast direction from the main gate of Naval Base Guam in the western community of Santa Rita in a general northeasterly direction to the main gate of Andersen Air Force Base in the community of Yigo It passes through Guams capital Hagta as well as intersecting various other territorial highways Along its route the highway runs through tropical forest areas urbanized commercial areas and residential neighborhoods The US Military built the road starting in 1941 Construction ceased with the Japanese invasion in December 1941 and resumed in 1944 The highway was formally dedicated to the US Marines by the territorial governor in 2004

GH1 begins near the entrance gate to Naval Base Guam at a junction with GH2A Known as Marine Corps Drive the route then travels to the northeast through tropical forests along Apra Harbor to the town of Piti After passing through Piti the drive runs along Tepungon Beach before turning inland near Asan Point The road passes the US Naval Hospital and Asan Point then it runs parallel to the coast along Asan Memorial Beach through the community of Asan Soon thereafter Marine Corps Drive cuts a path due east towards the Islands capital Hagta where it passes through the northern edge of the city In this area GH1 runs through commercial areas parallel to the West Agaa Beach Front area The drive passes the Paseo de Susana before following Trinchera Beach northeasterly through town
After passing through the capital and the community of Mongmong the road turns towards the northeast as it skirts to the west of Antonio B Won Pat International Airport on its way through the village of Tamuning After the airport the highway runs inland from the shoreline through the neighborhood of Tumon It runs northeasterly around the Micronesia Mall before turning southeasterly through residential areas as it cuts across the southern edges of Dededo It runs to the south of the Guam International Country Club and to the north of the Andersen Air Force Bases southern unit Through this area the north side of the highway is residential areas and the south side is tropical forests Marine Corps Drive passes the War Dead Cemetery and turns northeasterly residential areas on both sides of the roadway through Yigo before reaching its terminus at Salisbury Junction the main entrance to the Air Force Base where the road continues to the northwest as GH9

Like most major highways on Guam a speed limit is posted throughout most of its length In the past GH1 was one of the few roads to post a limit on lengths of lessdeveloped roadway However as more of the area became developed certain sections of the roads were posted with lower limits Travelers heading north away from the developed areas are allowed a speed limit However the southbound lanes on the same sections remain posted at due to development on the western side of the road

The United States Military began to develop and construct roads on the island in 1941 Some roads had existed prior to this but improvements were beginning to take shape Only one road which encircled most of the island had been graded It was the primary route linking Agana the name of the capital at the time to Piti and Asan This was the foundation for Marine Corps Drive After the Japanese invasion little infrastructure improvements were made by the occupiers Road construction resumed by the US Military after the island was invaded in 1944 In 60days a  fourlane superhighway with nine bridges was built after the invasion The remainder of the roadway was built and numbered under the local administration after Guam was given civil government in 1950

Named Marine Corps Drive throughout its length it was known as simply Marine Drive until the road was rededicated by Governor Felix Perez Camacho in 2004 In 2012 the DPW has started to install LED streetlights along Marine Corps Drive

Jakob Sederholm
Jakob Johannes Sederholm 20 July 1863  26 June 1934 was a Finnish petrologist most associated with his studies of migmatites

Troubled by illness throughout his life Sederholm originally chose to study geology to allow him to work outdoors After studying first in Helsinki where he was a student of Fredrik Johan Wiik then in Stockholm and Heidelberg Sederholm returned to Finland to work for the Geological Survey of Finland In 1893 he assumed the role of director of this institution a post he occupied until his death forty years later

Working on local Precambrian basement rocks Sederholm instigated a mapmaking programme that between 1899 and 1925 published many maps and descriptions of their geological history Gneisses in the areas he studied the socalled Baltic Shield were often of mixed composition with layers of granitic rock being interleaved with metamorphic rock Sederholm termed these as migmatites and viewed them as the product of the intrusion of igneous magma into metamorphic rocks at depth

During his career Sederholm received both the Murchison Medal from the Geological Society of London 1928 and the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America also 1928 The mineral sederholmite is named in his honour

Aside from his geological work Sederholm was a member of the Diet of Finland and undertook missions from this to the League of Nations He was also a member and chairman twice of the Economic Society of Finland

In the 1974 historical novel Centennial James Michener listed Sederholm among those scientists who made early estimates of the age of the Earth Sederholms estimate was 40 million years

Diego Murillo Bejarano
Diego Fernando Murillo Bejarano also known as Don Berna or Adolfo Paz is a former leader of the United SelfDefense Forces of Colombia paramilitary group as well as the leader of The Office of Envigado cartel He started working for the Medelln Cartel and ultimately led its militia wing After internal vendettas he became one of Pablo Escobars many enemies and became part of Los Pepes an organization headed by the Castao brothers Carlos and Fidel The organization controlled a powerful gang of hitmen named La Terraza The Terrace He then commanded two paramilitary blocs the Cacique Nutibara Bloc and the Granada Heroes Bloc

He became third in the chain of command of the AUC and a key player during the peace process in Santa Fe de Ralito Crdoba between his organization and the government of Colombia until he was accused by a court of being responsible for the death of a deputy He then escaped from Santa Fe de Ralito and surrendered to authorities four days later

In the early morning of May 13 2008 Murillo Bejarano and 13 other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the Colombian government According to Colombian Interior Minister Carlos Holgun they refused to comply with the countrys Peace and Justice law and were therefore extradited to the United States Many critics argued that this action would actually be favorable to the criminal as he would only be charged for drug trafficking in the United States as opposed to being charged for his many murders and other illegal activities in Colombia The next day Don Berna pleaded innocent to money laundering and drug trafficking charges filed by United States federal prosecutors of the Southern District of New York State The judge ruled the trial would begin September 16 2008

On June 17 2008 he pleaded guilty to trafficking tons of cocaine

The National Movement of State Crimes a coalition of several organizations of victims who suffered from state or paramilitary violence has asked for the return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims since they have not told all of the truth have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims and have not dismantled their criminal structures

The Office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated according to Colombian law the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previouslysuspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the Law of Justice and Peace and for the loss of the benefits established therein

The InterAmerican Commission stated that this affects the Colombian States obligation to guarantee victims rights to truth justice and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice systems regular criminal procedures It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders

<doc id="7709786" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709786" title="French ship Bretagne 1855">
French ship Bretagne 1855
The Bretagne was a fast 130gun threedecker of the French Navy designed by engineer Jules Marielle Built as a new capital ship meant to improve upon the very successful Ocan class while avoiding the weaknesses found on Valmy she retained most of the Ocan design but ended up incorporating the philosophy of fast ship of the line pioneered by Napolon with a rounded stern and a twocylinder 8boiler steam engine allowing her a speed of 135 knots The propeller could be retracted to streamline the hull when sailing under sail only

She was launched in 1855 and was too late to take part in the Crimean War She was decommissioned in 1865 becoming a schoolship for boys and sailors in Brest Struck from the Navy lists in 1880 she was broken up the same year

Bretagne was the offspring of an attempt to improve upon the Ocan class by increasing the beam from 1624 to 1664 metres

The 1849 budget initially allowed for construction of a new threedecker capital ship named Terrible in Brest but the ship was cancelled in 1848 to slim down expenses The 1850 budget then scheduled two ships named Bretagne and Desaix in honour of Louis Desaix to be built in Brest and Cherbourg respectively the order was placed on 15 March 1851 The mediocre performances of Valmy during her trials led to the Navy shedding the capital ship design of the Commission de Paris and start back from Sans Ocan design with only incremental modifications In late 1851 engineers De Gast responsible for Bretagne and Forquenot for Desaix decided on a reduction of the tumblehome by 20 centimetres and on a slight increase of the beam  alterations thought safe as the two last ships of the Ocan design Ville de Paris and LouisXIV had had their tumblehome reduced by 23 centimetres with no ill effect An initial suggestion to fit the ships with 160 shp steam engines allowing for a speed of 45 knots was declined as to minimise departures from Sans design
Bretagne was laid down on 4 August 1851 and Desaix on 27 Octobre On 17 June 1852 the Ministry of the Navy suspended construction and required that the ships be lengthened by 343 metres and that 540 shp steam engines be incorporated Brest responded to the requirements in September 1852 but at the same point Dupuy de Lmes fast ship of the line Napolon was completing her trials exhibiting such outstanding performances that on 10 September 1852 the Ministry cancelled the Bretagne class and ordered existing sailing ships to be converted to steamers using as many existing parts as possible At this point the keel bow and aft of Bretagne had been erected amounting to the third of the 24 construction steps defined by regulations in ship construction she was taken apart and rebuilt according to Marielles plans which had been approved in December 1852 At the same time the order for the steam engine was placed Desaix whose keel was only beginning to be laid was cancelled altogether and Arcole second ship of the Algsiras type the production series of the Napolon design was started instead

Launching of Bretagne took place on 17 February 1855 in spite of a 2C snow and strong wind a large populace gathered to watch the operation

The new design gave a length of 81 metres and a beam of 1808 this made Bretagne 8 metres longer and 2 metres wider than Napolon With a draught of 835 metre the ship had a volume of just under 20 000 m The engine provided by the Indret workshop occupied a 30metre long compartment and was designed for 1200 shp but could develop up to 3327 shp in peak power from eight boilers each with six furnaces Though direct transmission by an axis it moved a fourblade 63metre propeller which could be retracted into a vertical shaft only 13 metre wide thanks to the geometry of the blades The ship carried 590 tonnes of coal giving her an autonomy of 14 days at 10 knots and 6 days at her top speed of 14 knots With three month worth of food for the 1200man complement and one month worth fresh water completed by a distillation device to desalinate seawater she could stay at sea for 40 days

The main battery of Bretagne used 36pounder long guns the heaviest available calibre instead of the more modern 30pounder long gun on which other ships standardised their armament The aft of the ship was round and featured gun ports like on Napolon on her successors Although she carried 130 guns of various calibres Bretagne featured no less than 180 gun ports this allowed the crew to reinforce the artillery on one arc if needed and time permitting such as before a shore bombardment and fire up to 80 guns on one target

The figurehead figured the prophet Veleda an important character in the folklore of Bretagne with a sickle in hand and a wearing an oak leaf crown The transom featured the coat of arms of Bretagne carried by two geni and the name of the ship underneath The ship was painted in black with white stripes along the level of the gunports and copperred paint underwater

As completed Bretagne proved much heavier than anticipated designed to displace 6466 tonnes for an 820metre draught she actually displaced 6873 yielding a 9metre draught that lowered the lower battery to only 145 above water instead of the intended 175 metres
The ultimate increase in French capital ship design Bretagne increased the number of heavy guns on the lower battery to 18 on each side from the 15 of the Bretagne of 1766 and 16 on the Ocans In the original design half of these guns were 36pounder long guns as to maximise firepower at the price of standardisation on 30pounder long guns that typically prevailed at the time the other half being 60pounder Paixhans guns The middle deck fielded 18 30pounder short guns and another 18 Paixhans guns of 60 pounds The upper battery was armed with 38 30pounder howitzers Two 50pounders and 18 30pounder caronades complemented the armament on the deck This gave Bretagne a broadside of 2924 pounds 1431 kilogrammes compared to the 2400 of the original Ocan design

In 1869 after the ship became a school ship for the cole Navale this armament was replaced with 2 rifled 19cm guns on the lower deck 16 30pounder guns 4 riffled 16centimetre guns of the 1864 pattern 8 riffled 16centimetre guns modified after the 1860 or the 1862 pattern 2 muzzleloading 16centimetre riffled guns and 2 14centimetre guns on the middle battery and 2 bronze 12centimetre guns on the deck

Completed two years after her British homologue HMS Duke of Wellington Bretagne became the most powerful warship in the world but commissioned too late to effectively take part in the Crimean War which was almost over after the fall of Kinburn in October 1855 Appointed flagship of the Toulon squadron in January 1856 she sailed to the Black Sea to serve during the last months of the conflict which came to an end in July and helped return the French expeditionary corps back to France She was then part of the training squadron in Toulon cruising between Sardinia and Spain
Bretagne took part in the naval parade given in honour of Queen Victoria by Napolon III in Cherbourg Roads on 5 August 1858 The French Emperor intended to prove to the British that the recent improvements to Cherbourg military harbour were not meant as a threat to Great Britain and invited the British monarch Prince Albert and a large British delegation to visit the installations as a token of good faith The visit was counterproductive as the display of power of the French fleet compounded by bouts of diplomatic clumsiness such as inaugurating an equestrian statue of Napolon I irritated and worried the British After the British delegation departed in haste Bretagne took the French Emperor and Empress aboard and ferried them to Brest for the next leg of their official tour

Bretagne served as a troopship during the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 and a few months later the led the bombing of Ttouan forts in Morocco where a cannonball hit her hull In 1860 she sailed to Napoli for the funeral of Prince Jrme Napolon She then sailed to Gaeta in October under Admiral Adelbert Lebarbier de Tinan to oppose a Sardinian attack against Napolitan forces leading to the Battle of Garigliano She spend most of 1861 ferrying French troops deployed in Syria back to France before returning to Toulon

In 1865 Bretagne was transformed into a schoolship for boys and sailors leading to the removal of her engine In 1869 the artillery was replaced by an assortment of various types of guns for didactic purpose The 30gun corvette Galathe served as her tender On 28 January 1880 Bretagne was struck for the Navy lists and renamed to Ville de Bordeaux exchanging her name and equipment with Ville de Bordeaux and was towed to Landvennec to be broken up

<doc id="7709841" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7709841" title="QC clause">
QC clause
In insurance law a QC clause is a clause in an insurance policy usually but not exclusively a professional indemnity insurance policy that provides that an action against the insured is not to be contested unless a Queens Counsel or QC advises that the defence has a reasonable prospect of success The principal reason for such clauses is to minimise conflict between the insured and the insurer The insurer will often wish to settle claims as quickly and cheaply as possible but the insured may be concerned that paying on a claim implies negligence which will damage their professional reputation and want to contest the claim regardless Professional indemnity policies commonly provide that the insurer will pay the legal costs of the defence It is sometimes suggested that the clause is also designed to protect the public from the unjustified contesting of claims which have no real defence but this may represent a charitable view of the way insurance companies conduct claims

Conflicts between the insurer and insured can put a solicitor who represents both in an invidious position particularly where the solicitor has received confidential information from one party and may result in multiplicity of legal representation In practice however there is an enormous reluctance to invoke such clauses partly because of the expense of instructing Queens Counsel to advise and partly because of the insurers need to maintain good relations with the insured

Although still called QC clauses such clauses often provide that the advice of a junior barrister of a certain seniority may be taken

Some general liability policies contain a converse version the traditional QC clause viz that the insurer does not need to pay out on a claim against the insured unless a Queens Counsel advises that there is no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the claim

QC clauses were considered judicially by Lord Devlin in relation to another issue in West Wake Price  Co v Ching 1956 3 All ER 821

Richard Hertwig
Richard Wilhelm Karl Theodor Ritter von Hertwig 23 September 1850 in Friedberg Hesse  3 October 1937 in Schlederloh Bavaria also Richard Hertwig or Richard von Hertwig was a German zoologist and professor of 50 years notable as the first to describe zygote formation as the fusing of spermatozoa inside the membrane of an egg cell during fertilization
Richard Hertwig was the younger brother of Oscar Hertwig who also analyzed zygote formation

The Hertwig brothers were the most eminent scholars of Ernst Haeckel and Carl Gegenbaur each brother becoming a longterm professor in Germany They were independent of Haeckels philosophical speculations but took his ideas in a positive way to widen their concepts in zoology Initially between 18791883 they worked together and performed embryological studies especially on the theory of the coelom 1881 These problems were based on the phylogenetic theorems of Haeckel specifically the biogenic theory  and the gastraea theory of Haeckel

Leonardo da Vinci The Flights of the Mind
Leonardo da Vinci Flights of the Mind is a 2004 biography of Leonardo da Vinci by Charles Nicholl

The book researches the life of Leonardo da Vinci in Tuscane and explores the reasons of his historic success The authors main observation is that most of da Vincis work was unfinished Through a thorough research the author dismisses most of the romanticized facts about da Vinci and concludes that a lot is unknown about the genius inventor Da Vinci is described as an engineer obsessed with natural designs Washington Post writer Alexander Nagel criticized Nicholls technical analysis of the inventors paintings that lack insight and misses an opportunity to push deeper into the mind of da Vinci

The author retranslates many of da Vincis mirrorscript writings Some guesswork is admittedly thrown in this biography an old woman visiting da Vinci in 1493 becomes his mother Freudian concepts are used to explain his probable homosexuality Joseph missing from his representations of the Holy Family His stay in jail is linked to his plans to reverse engineer locks The author also argues that da Vincis obsession with flying devices comes from his alchemical quest for a levitation technology

David Gelernter criticized his interpretations around the hypothetical encounter of Michelangelo and da Vinci

The release of Leonardo da Vinci Flights of the Mind coincided with the release of another da Vinci biography Leonardo by Martin Kemp

Barrel children
Barrel children are children who are abandoned or left behind by their parents who are seeking a better life abroad

Dr Claudette CrawfordBrown the University of the West Indies academic who first described the phenomenon of barrel children defines barrel children as those children who while waiting in the Caribbean to migrate to their parents in the metropoles of North America and the United Kingdom receive material resources in the form of food and clothing in lieu of direct care Dr CrawfordBrown in her publication Who will save our children The plight of the Jamaican child in the nineties showed that these children have surrogate parents who are often unable to give them the emotional support and nurturance that they need most of these children may be instead raised by grandparents or close relatives

The impact on these children of this type of neglect includes a range of emotional and behavioural problems including runaway behaviour withdrawal depression and in some cases actingout behaviour The Trinidad and Tobago News said that for barrel children the psychological scars have been great and have been troubling factors unto the second third and fourth generations

The Wellcome Trust discussed barrel children in an article focusing on violence in the Caribbean while it was the title and subject of a short film by Cara Elmslie Weir about a Trinidadian family split by migration the parents sending barrels full of material goods from the US to their children in Trinidad

UNICEF in Jamaica agreed that Migration of parents who seek more lucrative employment abroad has had a negative impact on Jamaican children Some children are left in the care of strangers neighbours or even older siblings who are still children These socalled barrel children are left without parental guidance or adult supervision and with access to significant material resources in the form of cash remittances and barrels of clothing and toys sent by absentee parents

It has also been discussed in Caribbean Studies Journals conferences on the Caribbean the Trinidad Guardian and Trinidad Newsday Discussing absent parents The Trinidad Guardian noted that At holiday time they ship their barrels of love disguised as brandname sneakers and clothing believing that these would make their children happy and make up for them being not around But the fact remains that children are deprived of the real love of their parents

An article published in Newsweek by Brook Larmar entitled the Barrel Children dramatised the problem in its effects on one particular family The cardboard barrel has been sitting empty in Marsha Flowerss backyard for more than a month now but the Jamaican teenager hangs onto it as though it were a sacred totem And in a way it is Five years after her mother immigrated to the United States leaving Marsha and two sisters to fend for themselves in a Kingston slum the barrel is one of the few tangible signs of her mothers love  and of her own frustrated desires

Blogs also exist highlighting the experiences of barrel children Memories of a Caribbean Barrel Child was created by Dr Anthony Salandy a native of Trinidad and Tobago to shed light of the experiences and outcomes associated with being a barrel child

Following the PLPs second general election victory on 23 July 2003 Brown and ten PLP MPs refused to support PLP Leader Jennifer Smith as premier She resigned on 28 July 2003 and following a special leadership conference of the PLP William Alexander Scott was elected as leader of the party and premier Brown was elected as Deputy Leader of Party and Deputy Premier of Bermuda Responding to criticism that the leadership challenge was launched after the voters had already gone to the polls Brown responded We had to mislead you A compromise between the factions of the party led to Smith being replaced by William Alexander Scott and Brown being named Deputy Premier and later adding the Ministry of Tourism to his portfolio

Brown never made a secret of his aspiration to lead Bermuda telling a Howard University reporter in 2006 I always wanted to seek the leadership of my country and Im still in that process On 12 October 2006 Brown resigned from cabinet to make a second bid for leadership At a previously scheduled party delegates conference on the evening of 27 October he defeated the incumbent Scott by 107 to 76 and was sworn in as Premier on 30 October In a subsequent interview with the Bermuda Sun he said I have worked hard studied hard and prepared for the task of leadership to the best of the abilities that God has given me

When he reshuffled the cabinet he reclaimed the tourism and transportation portfolios and became in addition to Premier the Minister of Tourism and Transport Since then the Bermuda Government has made a number of proposals issuing a Vision Statement Taking Bermuda to the next level Current issues include indigent medical care traffic congestion environmental concerns over development and waste disposal race relations and independence

On a private member bill concerning sexual orientation Brown rejected the proposal saying I firmly believe in the right of all and any individuals to be free from discrimination in any form However I would not support the proposed Human Rights Amendment I do not believe that there is a need for special protection of persons in Bermuda based on their sexual orientation In April 2007 the government proposed restrictions on vehicle ownership intended to curb Bermudas growing road congestion problem Among the solutions offered are free travel on buses and ferries There are too many cars in Bermuda We must find a way  perhaps unpopular to many and disdained by others  to arrest the increase of cars on our beautiful island he said

Polls in 2007 and 2008 indicated that twothirds of the islands voters remain opposed to severing ties for various reasons including loss of EUstatus which Bermuda currently has as a British overseas territory Undaunted Premier Brown said I am firmly committed to Bermuda becoming an independent nation He has also spurned any participation in Whitehalls selection of the Governor of Bermuda saying We want to clarify our position that we are not interested in sending any criteria for any future governors for selection for the reason we dont think it is our responsibility The British government should send whoever they want to send

On 2 November 2007 following the reading of the Throne Speech by Governor John Vereker Premier Brown set 18 December 2007 as the date for Bermudas general election During the election campaign the PLP government held a joint press conference with the Bermuda Police Service on 12 December 2007 where it was revealed that a bullet had been mailed to the Premier and was being viewed as a serious and credible threat A police investigation was unable to determine the originator of the threat

Race relations continue to be a vexing issue in Bermuda occasionally leading to heated exchanges with the press and the opposition UBP in Parliament Brown rejected inappropriate questions as plantation questions He later explained A plantation question is for me a question which conjures up images of the plantation of a masterservant relationship a manboy relationship A question that would be asked of a black politician and not a white one I will continue to indicate to reporters if that is what a question is

Responding to opposition criticism of his wifes fundraising activities voiced in the House of Assembly he bristled Mr Speaker I have never had plans to cross this aisle but in recent weeks that Honourable Member has said a few things that would encourage me to do so I say to that Honourable Member that I would like to stay on this side of the House and not have come to the other side because it wouldnt be in order to vote for the UBP

On 7 October 2008 Ricardo M Urbina a United States federal judge ordered the immediate release of seventeen Chinese Uighurs from Guantnamo Bay Detention Camp the Uighur detainees in Guantanamo The United States had previously determined that the Uighurs were never terrorists and it no longer considered them enemy combatants Judge Urbina ruled that their detention is illegal because their indefinite detention was without cause

The United States continued to detain the Uighurs believing their lives would be in danger if they were released to China There was considerable political pressure from members of Congress not to release the Uighurs in the United States and the United States had a difficult time finding another country willing to accept them Eventually the Republic of Palau announced that it would accept the remaining Uighurs on a temporary basis

In June 2009 Brown announced that he had secretly made a deal with the United States to accept four of the Uighurs who arrived on the island overnight on humanitarian grounds he also promised to make them Bermudian nationals see also Belonger status The agreement to accept the Uighurs angered the government of the United Kingdom which was deliberately not informed about the proposed agreement

The government of the United Kingdom maintains that it has the authority over the acceptance of the Uighurs because agreements between Bermuda and foreign nations are strictly under the United Kingdoms control the government of Bermuda responded that the acceptance of the Uighurs is an immigration case and thus an internal matter

The decision was kept secret from Browns Cabinet Deputy Premier Paula Cox claimed she had been politically neutered the Governor and the Bermuda Police Service which would be responsible for any security concerns

The Opposition UBP tabled a motion of no confidence against Brown the next day saying that the premiers actions violated the Constitution of Bermuda and bordered on dictatorship Brown responded by saying that the firestorm would pass and that his position was not in danger but that he regretted the response to his actions The following week a protest march was organised by a PLP member to oppose Browns continuing premiership which was dismissed by Brown

Brown had initially stated he only intended to serve one term as premier and announced to a party conference in October 2008 that he intended to step down as party leader and premier in October 2010 Fulfilling that campaign promise Brown stepped down in October 2010 He was succeeded as leader of the PLP on 28 October 2010 by Paula Cox and in a byelection held on 14 December 2010 was succeeded as MP for Warwick South Central by PLP MP Marc Bean

Brown initially refused to provide testimony to the Commission of Inquiry under Sir Anthony Evans in October 2016 Browns evidence will be called again in November 16 to answer questions arising from the Auditor Generals report of financial irregularities during Browns term in government

Police Investigation

On February 11 2017 the Bermuda Police Service raided Dr Browns Bermuda businesses as part of their ongoing investigation into corruption and fraud

He owns two medical clinics Bermuda Healthcare Services in Paget Parish and the BrownDarrell Clinic in Smiths Parish which could receive more than 12 million from taxpayers as compensation for the cuts in fees for medical scans imposed by the One Bermuda Alliance administration in 2017 said to be contrary to the advice of the Bermuda Health Council

Alfred Robinson businessman
Alfred Robinson 18061895 was an American businessman and author in 19th century Alta California of Mexico and California of the United States Robinson wrote Life in California in 1846 an influential early description of the region and Juaneo Native American people

Alfred Robinson sailed to Alta California in 1829 in the employ of Bryant Sturgis and Company a Bostonbased firm in the California hide and tallow trade He married Anita de la Guerra de Noriega y Carrillo of the locally prominent de la Guerra family of Santa Barbara The marriage party is described by Richard Henry Dana Jr in Two Years Before the Mast

After the Mexican Cession and California was annexed by the US in 1848 and became a state in 1850 Robinson worked for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company and as a land manager during the 1850s through the 1880s

In 1868 he formed the Robinson Trust with Abel Stearns the most important land owner in Southern California in Los Angeles County The real estate sales partnership included four San Francisco investors Samuel Brannan E F Northam Charles B Polhemus Edward Martin The era of the large cattle ranchos was on the way out In its place came agriculture as ranchos were broken up and generally sold in farms and ranches The Trust acted as sales agents for the subdivisions In order to gain maximum coverage for their campaign they linked themselves to the California Immigrant Union and helped guide that organizations sales pitches

Alfred Robinson died in San Francisco in 1895

In 1846 Alfred Robinson published Life in California a comparatively sympathetic portrait of the lifeways and Californios political vicissitudes of the region under the Mexican Republic The book subsequently went through several reprintings

Equally important with Robinsons own descriptions was the fact that he appended to it a lengthy ethnographic description of the Juaneo  Acagchemem Native American Mission Indians and Chinigchinix at Mission San Juan Capistrano written in the 1820s by the Franciscan missionary Jernimo Boscana

Robinsons unpublished papers are on file at the California Historical Society library in San Francisco and at the University of California Berkeley

Bulgarian antihelicopter mines
The 4AHM100 AHM200 AHM2001 AHM2002 PMN150 and PMN250 are Bulgarian directional fragmentation mines that can be used with proximity fuzes to function as antihelicopter mines

The systems were developed by the Bulgarian Institute of Metal Science and are based around electronic fuzes with broadly similar functionality The fuzes use two sensors The first an acoustic sensor arms the mine as a helicopter approaches The second sensor is a radar which locates the target and triggers the mine at the appropriate point The mines all use a number of large Misznay Schardin effect warheads to project large numbers of fragments to an effective range of around 200 meters Janes Mines and Mine Clearance speculates that IFF could be integrated into the fuze circuit to discriminate against friendly aircraft lowering the chances of friendly fire

The PMN150 and PMN250 are large directional fragmentation mines that scatter fragments in a 60 degree horizontal arc The PMN150 produces approximately 1500 fragments that have an effective range of 150 meters The PMN250 is a larger mine which produces 2100 fragments that have an effective range of 250 meters The mines have a number of electronic fuzes available including three microwave fuzes an acoustic fuze and a seismic sensor The mines can be remotely triggered or deactivated

The AntiTransport Mine is a large circular directional fragmentation mine that uses an internal fragmentation matrix and five MisznaySchardin plates The fragmentation matrix produces a large number of small fragments and the Misznay Schardin plates produce large fragments that can penetrate armoured vehicles

The mine appears to be based on the PMN250 mine and the mine is likely to have an effective range of 250 meters

The 4AHM100 uses four 30 kilogram mines with a single central sensor The mines are triggered simultaneously when the sensor detects a target inside the effective footprint of the mines The mine is currently at the prototype stage

The AHM200 weighs 35 kilograms and contains 12 kilograms of TNT The mines warhead has two sections a large rectangular warhead with a prenotched fragmentation liner that produces 1960 fragments and a secondary warhead with five Misznay Schardin plates that produce large selfforging fragments The fragments scatter in an arc of 20 degrees to an effective range of 200 meters and will penetrate 10 millimeters of armour at 100 meters
The AHM2001 weighs 90 kilograms Like the AHM200 it consists of two sections a large circular fragmentation warhead with a filling of ball bearings and a horizontal section with five Misznay Schardin effect plate charges The two sections are mounted on a sturdy tripod with a sensor mounted above that contains a Doppler radar fuze and an acoustic fuze The mine has an effective range of about 100 meters

The AHM2002 weighs 90 kilograms and is similar to the AHM2001 except that it uses a rectangular fragmentation warhead that produces 1960 fragments

The West Torrens Baseball Club was founded in 1918 when several members of the Freemasons Ramblers Baseball Club combined with players from the Underdale area to enter a team to represent West Torrens in the 1919 district baseball competition The team finished second in its first season and won the A grade premiership the following year

The clubs first ground was in the parklands on the north side of Henley Beach Road and on the city east side of Blakewell Bridge Several parkland sites were used as home grounds over the next few years and at one stage even the current Richmond Oval site was used as a home base

During 1959 the club built its first HomeBase on the eastern boundary of Lockleys Oval Due to increasing membership and the requirement for improved facilities it became necessary to rebuild The present building Eagle Park resulted from countless hours of work by a select band of dedicated members during 197172 season It has since had additional rooms and facilities added

Cassini projection
The Cassini projection also sometimes known as the CassiniSoldner projection or Soldner projection is a map projection described by CsarFranois Cassini de Thury in 1745 It is the transverse aspect of the equirectangular projection in that the globe is first rotated so the central meridian becomes the equator and then the normal equirectangular projection is applied Considering the earth as a sphere the projection is composed of the operations

where  is the longitude from the central meridian and  is the latitude When programming these equations the inverse tangent function used is actually the atan2 function with the first argument sin and the second 

The reverse operation is composed of the operations

In practice the projection has always been applied to models of the earth as an ellipsoid which greatly complicates the mathematical development but is suitable for surveying Nevertheless the use of the Cassini projection has largely been superseded by the transverse Mercator projection at least with central mapping agencies

Areas along the central meridian and at right angles to it are not distorted Elsewhere the distortion is largely in a northsouth direction and varies by the square of the distance from the central meridian As such the greater the longitudinal extent of the area the worse the distortion becomes

Due to this the Cassini projection works best on long narrow areas and worst on wide areas

Cassini is known as a spherical projection but can be generalised as an elliptical form

Considering the earth as an ellipse the projection is composed of these operations

and M is the meridional distance function

The reverse operation is composed of the operations

Tambaqui
The tambaqui Colossoma macropomum is a large species of freshwater fish in the family Serrasalmidae It is native to tropical South America but kept in aquaculture and introduced elsewhere It is also known by the names black pacu blackfinned pacu giant pacu cachama gamitana and sometimes as pacu a name used for several other related species

The tambaqui is currently the only member of Colossoma but the two Piaractus species were also included in this genus in the past

The tambaqui is native to freshwater habitats in the Amazon and Orinoco basins of tropical South America In nutrientrich whitewater rivers such as the Madeira Juru Putumayo I and Purus it ranges throughout all the way up to their headwaters In nutrientpoor blackwater rivers such as the Rio Negro and clearwater rivers such as several rightbank tributaries of the Madeira it generally only occurs in the lower c and is rare beyond the lowermost c  It is widely kept in aquaculture outside its native range in South America Miocene fossils are known from the Magdalena River but modern occurrence in this river is due to introductions by humans

The tambaqui is the heaviest characin in the Americas the lighter Salminus can grow longer and the second heaviest scaled freshwater fish in South America after the arapaima It can reach up to in total length and in weight but a more typical size is  The largest caught by rodandreel and recognized by IGFA weighed  After the flood season around 10 of a tambaquis weight is the visceral fat reserves and at least another 5 is fat found in the head and muscles

It is similar in shape to the piranha and juveniles are sometimes confused with the carnivorous fish the tambaqui is tall and laterally compressed with large eyes and a slightly arched back Unlike more predatory species the teeth of the tambaqui are molarlike an adaption for crushing plant seeds and nuts The lower half of its body is typically mainly blackish The remaining is mainly gray yellowish or olive but the exact hue varies considerably and depends in part on habitat with individuals in blackwater being much darker than individuals from whitewater The pelvic anal and small pectoral fins are black The tambaqui resembles the pirapitinga Piaractus brachypomus but the latter species has a more rounded head profile less elongated and pointed and a smaller adipose fin that lacks rays as well as differences in teeth and operculum

Hybrids between the tambaqui and the similar Piaractus both species have been produced in aquaculture and are occasionally seen in the wild The hybrid offspring can be difficult to identify by appearance alone

This species is mostly solitary but it migrates in large schools During the nonbreeding season adults stay in flooded forests of white vrzea clear and blackwater igap rivers They stay there for four to seven months during the flood season but as the water level drops they move into the main river channels or to a lesser extent floodplain lakes At the start of the next flood season large schools move into whitewater rivers where they spawn between November and February The exact spawning location in the whitewater rivers is not entirely certain but apparently along woody shores or grassy levees The schools then break up as the adults return to the flooded forest of white clear and blackwater rivers and the annual pattern is repeated Larvae are found in whitewater rivers including the Amazon River itself Juveniles stay near macrophytes in floodplains and flooded forests yearround only switching to the adult migration pattern when reaching sexual maturity Maturity is reached at a length of about 

The species regularly reaches an age of 40 years and may reach up to 65

When there is not enough oxygen in the river or lake tambaqui obtain oxygen from the air They are able to do this by their physical and inner body parts such as their gills and swim bladder vascularization

Tambaqui is a fish that lives in freshwater Juveniles can survive in brackish water when the salinity is gradually raised Salinity levels above 20 gL result in death When juveniles are reared in salinities above 10 gL there is a significant detrimental effect on growth haematological parameters and osmoregulatory

In an experiment tambaqui had the pH of their water changed No deaths occurred to tambaqui if the pH did not fall to 30 The only internal difference that was noted in tambaqui when the pH was being altered was a change in the acidbase of the plasma and red cells

In another experiment tambaquis were exposed to pH drops from 60 to 40 similar to what they would encounter in their natural habitat Researchers found that the microbial communities of the tambaqui fish gut were very resilient to the pH drops which could explain part of the ability of tambaquis to migrate between black and white water streams in the Amazon 

Tambaqui consume fruits and seeds especially from woody angiosperms and herbaceous species Depending on the quantity and food quality of these foods it causes the fish to decide on their location of their habitat In one study during the highwater season 7898 percent of the diet consisted of fruits Another study of the stomach content of 138 specimens during the highwater season found that 44 of the weight was fruits and seeds 30 was zooplankton and 22 was wild rice Among 125 specimens during the lowwater season a higher percentage had empty stomachs 14 about ten times more than in the highwater season and about 70 of the total stomach content weight was zooplakton In addition to seeds fruits wild rice and zooplakton smaller levels of insects snails shrimps small fish filamentous algae and decaying plants are consumed

The tambaqui plays an important role in dispersing plant seeds The fruit seeds that fall in the water are consumed by tambaqui and the seed is dispersed somewhere else this is similar to what birds do This consumption includes about 35 of the trees and lianas during flood season and these seeds can grow after the floodwater calms down Compared to the younger and smaller tambaqui larger and older tambaqui are able to disperse the seeds in a faster rate The gut of a wellfed tambaqui can contain more than seeds In general more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the pirapitinga Piaractus brachypomus than the tambaqui meaning that the former overall is a more efficient seed disperser

The flesh of the tambaqui is popular and fetches top prices in fish markets in its native range It is marketed fresh and frozen

Wild populations of the tambaqui have declined because of overfishing and many currently caught fish are juveniles In Manaus alone the landings fell from c per year in the 1970s to in 1996 Based on a review by IBAMA it was the 11th most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998 just ahead of the closely related pirapitinga Piaractus brachypomus

The tambaqui is now widely kept in aquaculture It can live in oxygenpoor waters and is very resistant to diseases In Brazil tambaqui is one of the main fish species that is farmed and therefore important to the countrys economy Studies of farmed tambaqui in Brazil have revealed a genetic diversity similar to that seen among wild populations In fish farms this species is sometimes hybridized with Piaractus to produce offspring that accept a wider temperature range colder water than pure tambaqui

In Thailand this fish known locally as pla khu dam  was introduced from Hong Kong and Singapore as part of fishfarming projects but has adapted to local conditions and thrives in the wild in some areas There is also an introduced population in Puerto Rico and singles likely deliberate releases by aquarists have been caught in a wide range of US states but only those in the warmest regions can survive

Juveniles long sometimes labelled as vegetarian piranha are frequently seen in the aquarium trade but they rapidly grow to a large size and require an enormous tank

Multiple subpial transection
Multiple subpial transections is a surgical treatment modality for epilepsy used in scenarios wherein epileptogenic brain regions from where partial seizures originate cannot be removed safely The surgeon makes a series of shallow cuts transections into the brains cerebral cortex These cuts are thought to interrupt some fibers that connect neighboring parts of the brain but they do not appear to cause longlasting impairment in the critical functions that these areas perform

Multiple subpial transections can help to reduce or eliminate seizures arising from vital functional areas of the cerebral cortex This procedure has been successful in an unusual type of epilepsy called LandauKleffner syndrome at least for a limited time

Bleeding at the site of the transection is possible but the procedure is generally well tolerated Major complications appear to be rare Transections in language areas of the brain may mildly impair the language function served by that area

Epilepsy surgery is reserved for people whose seizures are not well controlled by seizure medicines this situation is sometimes describes as being medically refractory In the past epilepsy patients were referred for surgery only after they had taken medicine after medicine without success often for 10 years or more However now the definition of medically refractory has changed and surgery is being performed as early as 1 to 2 years after the diagnosis of epilepsy is first made

In children the definition of medically refractory is even more individualized to the specific childs situation Surgery may be considered for some children after only weeks or months of treatment with seizure medicines

In general a person is considered to be a potential candidate for surgery if adequate trials of two firstline seizure medicines ones that are commonly effective in controlling the type of seizures the person is experiencing and one twodrug combination all have failed to control the seizures A trial of a medication is considered adequate when it has been increased gradually to the maximum dosage that does not cause serious side effects and then is given for a long enough period If the person has frequent seizures any improvement will be obvious after a short time However if the seizures generally occur far apart it may take months to determine whether the time between seizures is increasing

At some epilepsy centers patients are offered additional conventional or experimental medications before surgery is considered However research suggests that each time a trial of medication fails to control a persons seizures it becomes less likely that a different medicine or combination will be successful Since uncontrolled seizures present serious physical risks and social and psychological consequences the trend these days is to proceed with surgery much sooner than in the past if it seems appropriate for that person

Success rates for epilepsy surgery are constantly improving and advances in preoperative assessments are largely responsible Proper patient selection and a thorough presurgical workup are the cornerstones of surgical success

If a review of the persons experiences with seizure medicines shows that adequate tests of at least a few different medications have not succeeded in controlling the seizures then the person may be referred to a specialist for a preoperative or presurgical assessment

The preoperative assessment has two general objectives


The number and type of tests that make up the preoperative assessment will depend on the type of surgery being considered General objectives of the tests include

DeFRaG
DeFRaG also capitalised as defrag abbreviated as df and its name comes from  Dfis Fragdome  is a free software modification for id Softwares firstperson shooter computer game Quake III Arena Q3A The mod is dedicated to player movements and trickjumping It aims at providing a platform for selftraining competition online tricking machinima making and trickjumping Hence it constitutes an exception among other Q3A mods

The mod includes a variety of featurestimers and meters ghost mode cheat prevention and learning tools Specially designed maps are provided that will rely on the players movement abilities to be completed up to the finish line while standard Q3A maps and Capture the Flag CTF fast captures are supported as well Furthermore gamespace physics from both the original Q3A and the Challenge ProMode Arena CPMA mod are supported

The modification was released to the public in ca SeptemberOctober 2000 In 2002 DeFRaG was selected as Mod of the Week at Planet Quake

DeFRaG was initially designed for making possible a new kind of competition based on timed runs Those competitions called DeFRaG runs differ from common speedruns in several ways Unlike speedruns DeFRaG runs are not done in maps from an outofthebox original game but in specially designed and customed DeFRaG maps and there are no opponents to be vanquished during the run Because of their design many of these maps cannot be completed by normal player skills rather trickjumping skills are indispensable Furthermore start checkpoints and stoptriggers are built into the maps As a proof of the accomplishment the mod automatically records a demo of every map completed successfully Along with the demo the precise time in which the map was completed is stored

The mods competitive method is lent to it by an online infrastructure which has triggered the formation of a transnational community Players download customdesigned maps more than 6000 DeFRaG maps are available and aim to complete the maps objectives in the shortest time possible The best times can be submitted to online high score tables which are keeping track of the fastest times for particular maps These online scoreboards can be global or encompass certain regions only During the mods highest popularity the DeFRaG development team periodically released new map packs containing a number of officially sanctioned maps These are generally the only maps on which times are accepted for the official website high score tables In consequence the DeFraG communitys individual members engage and specialize in one or more different practices trickjumping itself movie making map making coding maintaining websites portals for interaction and as archives for maps and movies and online scoreboards

The DeFRaG modification completely removes violence from the otherwise visceral firstperson shooter The gameplay mode or discipline called deathmatch came of age with Doom and was also in Q3A the latter being dedicated to multiplayer competition From these games electronic sports and particularly its professional variant emerged The same games drove the computer games and violence controversy to unprecedented heights While the Doom series was heavily criticized for its gory content the problem with Q3A was seen to be its focus on deathmatch because in this discipline the ultimate objective is to kill frag as many other players as possible But in DeFRaGnowikinowikis gameplay modes killing opponents has no place whatsoever DeFRaG gameplay is all about improving the skills to exploit the peculiarities of the Q3A physics in order to move faster to navigate along courses through the map topographies formerly deemed to be impossible or to perform moves as yet unseen In consequence the ingame weapons are no more regarded as instruments of destruction Rather DeFRaG players use them as tools for moving around gamespace This transformation of a firstperson shooter into a vehicle for virtual gymnastics meanwhile has gradually been recognized by mainstream media It is thrown into the public discourse as a counterweight to the stereotype of computer games fostering violent behaviour The DeFRaG mod stars prominently in this

The highskill requirement of the game along with the fast pace cause that game movies are often made using content created by playing DeFRaG game modes Within the communitys tradition especially the fastest runs difficult trickjumping techniques are included in sequence The DeFRaG demoplayback system includes settings to view the primary player from various angles and perspectives This is in line with the history of the machinima phenomenon which originates from the speedrun community of Quake the first game in the series By following the argumentation of Stanford historian of science and technology Henry Lowood DeFRaG can be called an instance of transformative highperformance play

Some of these movies won gaming industry awards For instance the freestyle trickjumping movie Tricking iT2 by Jethro Brewin jrb won five Golden Llamas Awards in 2004 The categories were Best Picture Best Audio Best Tech Best Editing and Direction and Best Quake Movie In the following year the trickstunt movie Reaching Aural Nirvana by mrks won a Golden Llamas Award in the category Best Audio Also in 2005 the arthouse short movie defragged directed by Margit Nobis an instance of Q3A machinima its name is borrowed from the DeFRaG mod was shown at numerous prestigious festivals including the Vienna Independent Shorts festival

All maps share the common objective of finishing in the fastest time possible but there are variations on how this is achieved Run mode is a flatout race which the objective is to finish line In accuracy mode map is completed after a certain number of targets have been hit with the railgun a Q3A sniper rifle Level mode is similar to run but map provide a number of alternative ways of reaching the finish line In fast caps mode the time is measured since the flag has been taken Training mode usually requires the successful usage of a particular technique in order to complete the level There also freestyle maps without primary objective but where the player may practise particular techniques The type of map can usually be seen in its name although some do not follow this convention

There are two game physics and ruleset modesVanilla Quake 3 VQ3 and Challenge ProMode CPM VQ3 is an original Q3A physics and game ruleset CPM is an altered game physics delivered from Challenge ProMode Arena modification It provides a gamemode which includes physics allowing for better aircontrol rebalanced weapons fast weapon switching and improvements of jumping techniques

The completion of a DeFRaG map requires the use of a variety of trickjumping techniques Most Training maps involve only one or two methods but some more complicated Run and Level maps can require any number Various map sections can require quick timing combination and flawless execution of several techniques

Jumping techniques allows a player to move faster farther andor jump higher The most common techniques included in Q3A and DeFRaG itself includes bunny hopping air strafing strafejumping circlejumping rampjumping etc

Bunnyhopping is the most basic method of fast movement in which player is jumping repeatedly instead of running in order to move faster Strafejumping SJ is a technique necessary to complete the majority of DeFRaG maps and is considered to be the most fundamental technique in trick jumping It is only possible because of a specificity of the games physics unintentionally allowing moving vectors to add up to greater acceleration Basically no matter if the players character is moving on the ground running or is airborne jumping the game engine always strives to limit its speed However already in the original Quake it was discovered that by nontrivial timed sequences of striking the direction keys involving moving sideways strafing in gamer language and movements of the mouse this limitation of speed could be overcome As the Quake engines are the basis of many games the possibility of strafe jumping is existing within other games too But Q3Anowikinowikis trickjumping community developed several distinct subtechniques including singlebeat strafejumping singlebeat strafejumping with airchange doublebeat strafejumping halfbeat strafejumping and inverted strafejumping The DeFRaG mod includes a helping tool the Camping Gaz HeadUp Display CGazHUD which provides conveniently graphically formatted realtime feedback on acceleration and angles involved

Circlejumping CJ is based on the same principles as strafejumping circlejumping more often than not is used as the starting technique for a strafejumping run Another technique involves ramped surfaces and its called rampjumping jumping on a ramped surface gives a height boost
Air strafing can be done when the player is in the air simply keeping himherself aligned at the optimal angle in relation to where the player wants to go making the player go farther and faster whilst airborne one of the methods for reaching difficult places

Weaponjumping techniques requires the player jumps off the ground and by using the proper weapon immediately afterwards fires a bullet rocket grenade plasma or BFG plasma onto the spot on the floor exactly or very near beneath herhim The damage of the resulting blast delivers momentum to the players character and propels herhim higher into the air than possible by regular jumping The gain in momentum can be used for vertical horizontal and diagonal movement In Q3A four weapons makes selfsplash damage and can be combined with each otherrocket and grenade launcher BFG10K and plasma gun

Rocketjumping RJ is the only tricking technique using a weapon that can commonly be observed in Q3A professional deathmatch competitionin spite of the resulting cost in health with selfinflicting splash damage enabled in this game mode Depending on the size and topography of the map and proper synchronisation two or larger number of rockets can be timed to impact on the very same spot a fraction of a second or nth after the player arrives there Thus the player can capitalize on the added momentum furnished by the detonation of multiple projectiles accelerate substantially and travel long distances airborne When playing in DeFRaGnowikinowikis multiplayer mode projectiles fired by other players can be used as well

Grenadejumping GJ is a technique which demands more exacting timing because the grenadelaunchers projectile ricochets after it is launched and its detonation is delayed Combining more than one grenade in order to make GJ is also possible but may require more players due to detonation delay BFGjumping is a technique kin to rocketjumping and only insofar different as the BFG has a higher rate of fire and makes more splash damage Plasmajumping also called plasmahopping is a technique in which plasma gives slight boost to the jump

Team tricking weaponjumpings requires teamwork with minimum one additional player In DeFRaG every weapon can be used in this technique the other players weapon may deliver additional momentum Most common team techniques includes gauntlet rocket grenade and railjumping

The plasma gun can be used to climb along walls a technique called plasmaclimbing The vertical climb is the most basic variant The successive recoil of the guns rapid fire then lifts the player up the wall By various combinations of directionkeys and mouselook horizontal and diagonal paths are possible as well Expert performers can change the directions of travel en route climb down and up again climb along curved walls and hit high walls from midair to plasmaclimb in any direction

Techniques exploiting bugs capitalize on flaws in the game engine which in some maps lend special qualities to certain locations resulting in Q3A physics anomalies

If at particular spots the player falls from a certain height to the ground they will be catapulted up again although no jumppad is present the technique is named overbounce Overbounces can be combined with weapon techniques The DeFRaG mod includes an overbounce detector a tool that helps the player to identify locations in maps where an overbounce is possible A variety of overbounce opportunities has been discovered made into techniques and have been named accordingly vertical horizontal sticky diagonal weird zeroups diagonal and slippery diagonal overbounce

At certain locations when a player steps near a wall and jumps to it shehe will end up sticking to the wall in midair Now the player can perform a speedgaining technique like strafejumping without herhis character moving from the spot but accelerating nevertheless This is a real anomaly as the player character does not move in gamespace but the game engine ascribes ever higher speed to it The player then can unstick from the wall by firing a splash damage weapon into it and subsequently will move with the speed gained on the spot This technique is called sticky wall or rebounce

COSMOS telecommunications
COSMOS computer system for main frame operations was a recordkeeping system for main distribution frames MDFs in the Bell System the American Bell Telephone Company and then subsequently ATTled system which provided telephone services to much of the United States and Canada from 1977 to 1984 

COSMOS was introduced in the 1970s after MDFs were found to be congested in large urban telephone exchanges It assigns terminals so jumpers need not be so long thus leaving more space on the shelves COSMOS also converts customer service orders into printed work orders for staff who connect the jumpers COSMOS orders are usually coordinated with RCMAC to ensure that translations match wiring With good computer records jumpers are often left in place for reuse when one customer replaces another resulting in a great reduction in labor

More modern modular MDFs were developed around the same time called COSMIC Common System Main Interconnecting frames

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as stress cardiomyopathy is a type of nonischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart This weakening may be triggered by emotional stress such as the death of a loved one a breakup rejection from a partner or constant anxiety This leads to one of the common names broken heart syndrome Stress cardiomyopathy is now a wellrecognized cause of acute heart failure lethal ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular rupture

The name takotsubo syndrome comes from the Japanese word  octopus trap because the left ventricle takes on a shape resembling an octopus trap

The typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is chest pain associated with electrocardiogram ECG changes mimicking a myocardial infarction of the anterior wall During the course of evaluation of the patient a bulging out of the left ventricular apex with a hypercontractile base of the left ventricle is often noted It is the hallmark bulgingout of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base that earned the syndrome its name takotsubo octopus trap in Japan where it was first described

Stress is the main factor in takotsubo cardiomyopathy with more than 85 of cases set in motion by either a physically or emotionally stressful event that prefaces the start of symptoms Examples of emotional stressors include grief from the death of a loved one fear of public speaking arguing with a spouse relationship disagreements betrayal and financial problems Acute asthma surgery chemotherapy and stroke are examples of physical stressors In a few cases the stress may be a happy event such as a wedding winning a jackpot a sporting triumph or a birthday

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women Often there is a history of a recent severe usually negative sometimes happy emotional or physical stress

The cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not fully understood but several mechanisms have been proposed

It is likely that there are multiple factors at play that could include some amount of vasospasm and a failure of the microvasculature
Case series looking at large groups of patients report that some patients develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy after an emotional stress while others have a preceding clinical stressor such as an asthma attack or sudden illness Roughly onethird of patients have no preceding stressful event A 2009 large case series from Europe found that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was slightly more frequent during the winter season This may be related to two possiblesuspected pathophysiological causes coronary spasms of microvessels which are more prevalent in cold weather and viral infections  such as Parvovirus B19  which occur more frequently during the winter

Transient apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is found in 1722 of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome While the original case studies reported on individuals in Japan takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been noted more recently in the United States and Western Europe It is likely that the syndrome previously went undiagnosed before it was described in detail in the Japanese literature Evaluation of individuals with takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically includes a coronary angiogram to rule out occlusion of the left anterior descending artery which will not reveal any significant blockages that would cause the left ventricular dysfunction Provided that the individual survives their initial presentation the left ventricular function improves within two months

The diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be difficult upon presentation The ECG findings often are confused with those found during an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction It classically mimics STsegment elevation myocardial infarction and is characterised by acute onset of transient ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities ballooning accompanied by chest pain shortness of breath STsegment elevation Twave inversion or QTinterval prolongation on ECG Cardiac enzymes are usually negative and are moderate at worst and cardiac catheterization usually shows absence of significant coronary artery disease

The diagnosis is made by the pathognomonic wall motion abnormalities in which the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally or is hyperkinetic while the remainder of the left ventricle is akinetic or dyskinetic This is accompanied by the lack of significant coronary artery disease that would explain the wall motion abnormalities Although apical ballooning has been described classically as the angiographic manifestation of takotsubo it has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction in this syndrome includes not only the classic apical ballooning but also different angiographic morphologies such as midventricular ballooning and rarely local ballooning of other segments

The ballooning patterns were classified by Shimizu et al as takotsubo type for apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesia reverse takotsubo for basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia midventricular type for midventricular ballooning accompanied by basal and apical hyperkinesia and localised type for any other segmental left ventricular ballooning with clinical characteristics of takotsubolike left ventricular dysfunction

In short the main criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are the patient must have experienced a stressor before the symptoms began to arise the patients ECG reading must show abnormalities from a normal heart the patient must not show signs of coronary blockage or other common causes of heart troubles the levels of cardiac enzymes in the heart must be elevated or irregular and the patient must recover complete contraction and be functioning normally in a short amount of time

The treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally supportive in nature for it is considered a transient disorder Treatment is dependent on whether patients experience heart failure or acute hypotension and shock In many individuals left ventricular function normalizes within two months Aspirin and other heart drugs also appear to help in the treatment of this disease even in extreme cases After the patient has been diagnosed and myocardial infarction heart attack ruled out the aspirin regimen may be discontinued and treatment becomes that of supporting the patient

While medical treatments are important to address the acute symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy further treatment includes lifestyle changes It is important that the individual stay physically healthy while learning and maintaining methods to manage stress and to cope with future difficult situations

Although the symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually go away on their own and the condition completely resolves itself within a few weeks some serious complications can happen that must be treated These most commonly include congestive heart failure and very low blood pressure and less commonly include blood clotting in the apex of the left ventricle irregular heart beat and tearing of the heart wall

For patients in acute heart failure ACE inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and beta blockers are considered mainstays of heart failure treatment But use of beta blockers specifically for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is controversial because they may confer no benefit

For people with cardiogenic shock medical treatment is based on whether a left ventricular outflow tract LVOT obstruction is present Therefore early echocardiography is necessary to determine proper management For those with obstructed LVOTs inotropic agents should not be used but instead should be managed like patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy eg phenylephrine and fluid resuscitation For cases in which the LVOT is not obstructed inotropic therapy eg dobutamine and dopamine may be used but with the consideration that takotsubo is caused by excess catecholamines

Furthermore mechanical support with an intraaortic balloon pump IABP is wellestablished as supportive treatment

Despite the grave initial presentation in some of the patients most of the patients survive the initial acute event with a very low rate of inhospital mortality or complications Once a patient has recovered from the acute stage of the syndrome they can expect a favorable outcome and the longterm prognosis is excellent Even when ventricular systolic function is heavily compromised at presentation it typically improves within the first few days and normalises within the first few months Although infrequent recurrence of the syndrome has been reported and seems to be associated with the nature of the trigger

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare affecting between 12 and 22 of people in Japan and 2 to 3 in Western countries who suffer a myocardial infarction It also affects far more women than men with 90 of cases being women most postmenopausal Scientists believe one reason is that estrogen causes the release of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in response to mental stress It is not likely for the same recovered patient to experience the syndrome twice although it has happened in rare cases The average ages at onset are between 58 and 75 years Less than 3 of cases occurred in patients under age 50

Rees et al wrote in 1967 that the death of a close relative increases the risk of dying within one year by a factor of seven

Engel wrote about sudden and rapid death during psychological stress in 1971 and itemized 8 causation categories 1 on the impact of the collapse or death of a close person 2 during acute grief 3 on threat of loss of a close person 4 during mourning or on an anniversary 5 on loss of status or selfesteem 6 personal danger or threat of injury 7 after the danger is over 8 reunion triumph or happy ending He proposed these events provoke neurovegetative responses involving both the flightfight and conservationwithdrawal systems conducive to lethal cardiac events particularly in individuals with preexisting cardiovascular disease

Although the first scientific description of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not until the 1990s Cebelin and Hirsch wrote about human stress cardiomyopathy in 1980 The two looked at homicidal assaults that had happened in Cuyahoga County Ohio the past 30 years specifically those with autopsies who had no internal injury but had died of physical assault They found that 11 of 15 had myofibrillar degeneration similar to animal stress studies In the end they concluded their data supported the theory of catecholamine mediation of these myocardial changes in man and of the lethal potential of stress through its effect on the heart

The first studied case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was in Japan in 1991 by Sato et al More cases of the syndrome appeared in Japan within the next decade although western medicine had still not acknowledged it The syndrome finally occurred in 1997 when Pavin et al wrote about two cases of reversible LV dysfunction precipitated by acute emotional stress The western world had not heard of such a thing at the time as it was incredibly rare and often misdiagnosed The Japanese at last reported about the syndrome to the west in 2001 under the name transient LV apical ballooning though at this point the west had already heard of numerous cases The syndrome reached international audiences through the media in 2005 when the New England Journal of Medicine wrote about the syndrome

A case of what is evidently takotsubo syndrome is a central motif of the end of the novel Blossoms in Autumn  1917 by Slovene writer Ivan Tavar and the film Blossoms in Autumn 1973 inspired by it A village girl named Meta suddenly dies after she had been asked by Janez a lawyer from Ljubljana that she had spent summer with to marry him At her funeral her father states that she was never very healthy and that she had a heart defect Her mother states She has died from happiness

RAF Great Dunmow
Royal Air Force Station Great Dunmow or more simply RAF Great Dunmow Also known as Little Easton is a former Royal Air Force station in Essex England The airfield is located approximately mi west of Great Dunmow north of the A120 about northeast of London

Opened in 1943 it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces during the war primarily as a bomber airfield The airfield was closed in 1948

Today the airfield is located on private land primarily used for agriculture

Great Dunmow was designed as a Class A airfield bomber airfield built by the US Army 818th Engineer Battalion Aviation with specialised work by British contractors

The airfield was built on ancient parkland belonging to Easton Lodge and some 10000 trees were destroyed to enable its construction including over 200 mature oak trees It consisted of a set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings optimally placed at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern The runways were a main runway aligned 1533 and two secondary secondary runways aligned 1129 and 0422 An encircling perimeter track was also constructed containing 50 looptype hardstands

Great Dunmow airfield was opened on 1 July 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth and Ninth Air Forces It was known as USAAF Station AAF164 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war and by which it was referred to instead of location Its USAAF Station Code was GD

USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Great Dunmow were 
Regular Army Station Units included

The first unit to use Great Dunmow was the American 386th Bombardment Group Medium which arrived from RAF Boxted on 24 September 1943 The group was assigned to the VIII Air Support Command 3d Bombardment Wing and flew Martin B26BC Marauders Operational squadrons of the 322d were

Missions of the 386th concentrated on airfields but also bombed marshalling yards and gun positions during the first months of combat

In common with other Marauder units of the 3d Bomb Division the 386th was transferred to Ninth Air Force 98th Bombardment Wing on 16 October 1943

On 2 October 1944 the 386th Bomb Group moved to BeaumontsurOise A60 Airfield in Normandy France On the continent the 386th BG used the following Advanced Landing Grounds

After VE Day the group returned to the United States inactivating at Seymour Johnson AFB North Carolina on 7 August 1945

The airfield was abandoned in 1948

With the end of military control in 1950 the grassed areas were cut for a grass meal company through the 1950s which supplied it to various farms in the region Starting in 1960 farming operations commenced and the concrete areas were removed for aggregate in 196566 for use as part of the new A12 road

Today there is very little left except some single track agricultural roads remaining from the perimeter track and a blister hangar with a few nissen huts near Easton Lodge The runway layout and the airfield perimeter track are easily identified in aerial photography but no substantial amount of concrete remains The 22 end of the secondary northeast runway does however have a short full width of runway intact being used for manure storage The current owners Land Securities hope to redevelop the site and surrounding area including the construction of around 9000 homes

There is a small museum in Great Dunmow which holds some exhibits of the airfield and the 386th Bomb Group along with a stained glass window memorial in Little Easton church

Mirror go
Mirror go is a type of elementary Go opening strategy It refers to all go openings in which one player plays moves that are diagonally opposite those of this opponent making positions that have a rotational symmetry through 180 about the central 1010 point tengen in Japanese The Japanese term for mirror go is manego

There are actually two types of strategy of this kind and several ways the symmetry can or should be broken for tactical or strategic reasons


In itself mirror go is a deeply flawed strategy It may be refuted in a number of ways using ladder tactics using ko fights or most convincingly for a novice by using contact plays to demonstrate that possession of the central point can just as well lead to shortage of liberties This has not prevented the circulation of folklore stories about mirror go as some kind of surewin strategy eagerly taken up by novice players Hikaru No Go episode 8 featured a naive attempt to trick Akira Toya using mirror go which Toya easily rebuffed using the contact play strategy

Mirror go can be refuted in boards of odd size rather more easily than those of even size This is a probable explanation of why odd sizes are always used On evensized boards ladders and kos still can be used

After sporadic use down the years mirror go was brought back into some fashion by the shinfuseki period in which the tengen opening was explored Subsequently Fujisawa Kuranosuke used it often as White aiming for largescale battles

The course of Bucktail State Park Natural Area is as follows leaving the city of Lock Haven Pennsylvania Route 120 and the West Branch Susquehanna River pass through the following municipalities in Clinton County heading west in order Allison Woodward Bald Eagle Colebrook Grugan and Chapman townships the boroughs of Renovo and South Renovo and Noyes Township Next Pennsylvania 120 leaves the West Branch Susquehanna River and follows Sinnemahoning Creek west through East Keating Township then crosses into Cameron County There Pennsylvania Route 120 and Sinnemahoning Creek pass west through Gibson Township and enter the borough of Driftwood where Route 120 follows the Driftwood Branch of Sinnemahoning Creek north through Gibson Lumber Portage and Shippen townships finally reaching the borough of Emporium and the western end of Bucktail State Park

Pennsylvania Route 120 follows an old Native American Trail the Sinnemahoning Path This trail was used by Native Americans to cross the eastern continental divide specifically the Allegheny Front between the Susquehanna River which drains into the Chesapeake Bay and the Allegheny River which forms the Ohio River with the Monongahela River at Pittsburgh and eventually drains into the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River American Pioneers also used the trail to make their way west and it was also known as the Bucktail Trail As the technology of road building advanced what was once a Native American Trail became the two lane highway known today as Pennsylvania Route 120

Pennsylvania Route 120 was officially designated as Bucktail State Park in 1933 by an act of the Pennsylvania Legislature The Act says

Although the park covers  much of the land within the park boundaries is actually in private hands The rest of the land in the valleys is owned by the Bureau of State Parks and the Bureau of Forestry as part of Elk State Forest and Sproul State Forest

Bucktail State Park Natural Area is in the West Branch and Sinnemahoning Valleys River valleys are ideal gathering points for wildlife as the valleys tend to be warmer and wetter than the surrounding mountains Animals are drawn to the warm and wet valley The river valley is a natural passageway for plants and animals The valley is home to river birch and sycamore trees Osprey a wide variety of duck whitetailed deer bald eagles otter merganser mink and black bear can all be seen living in the boundaries of Bucktail State Park Natural Area
Elk can be seen in the early morning and late afternoon hours in the northern portions of the park Special elk viewing playforms have been built in Sinnemahoning State Park and near the small village of Bennezette

<doc id="7710180" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710180" title="Quantum tictactoe">
Quantum tictactoe
Quantum tictactoe is a quantum generalization of tictactoe in which the players moves are superpositions of plays in the classical game The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs who describes it as a way of introducing quantum physics without mathematics and offering a conceptual foundation for understanding the meaning of quantum mechanics

The motivation to invent quantum tictactoe was to explore what it means to be in two places at once In classical physics a single object cannot be in two places at once In quantum physics however the mathematics used to describe quantum systems seems to imply that before being subjected to quantum measurement or observed certain quantum particles can be in multiple places at once The textbook example of this is the doubleslit experiment How the universe can be like this is rather counterintuitive There is a disconnect between the mathematics and our mental images of reality a disconnect that is absent in classical physics This is why quantum mechanics supports multiple interpretations

The researchers who invented quantum tictactoe were studying abstract quantum systems formal systems whose axiomatic foundation included only a few of the axioms of quantum mechanics Quantum tictactoe became the most thoroughly studied abstract quantum system and offered insights that spawned new research It also turned out to be a fun and engaging game a game which also provides good pedagogy in the classroom

The rules of quantum tictactoe attempt to capture three phenomena of quantum systems

Quantum tictactoe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tictactoe the number of marks allowed in each square Additional rules specify when and how a set of marks collapses into classical moves

On each move the current player marks two squares with their letter X or O instead of one and each letter X or O is subscripted with the number of the move beginning counting with 1 The pair of marks are called spooky marks Because X always moves first the subscripts on X are always odd and the subscripts on O are always even

For example player 1s first move might be to place X in both the upper left and lower right squares The two squares thus marked are called entangled During the game there may be as many as eight spooky marks in a single square if the square is entangled with all eight other squares

The phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that a cyclic entanglement causes a measurement A cyclic entanglement is a cycle in the entanglement graph for example if
then these three squares form a cyclic entanglement At the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created the player whose turn it is not  that is the player who did not create the cycle  chooses one of two ways to measure the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to collapse into classical tictactoe moves In the preceding example since player 2 created the cycle player 1 decides how to measure it Player 1s two options are


Any other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time for example if square 1 were also entangled via O with square 5 then either measurement above would force O to collapse into square 5 Note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in a single turn

When a move collapses into a single square that square is permanently marked in larger print with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move  a classical mark A square containing a classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game no more spooky marks may be placed in it

The first player to achieve a tictactoe three in a row horizontally vertically or diagonally consisting entirely of classical marks is declared the winner Since it is possible for a single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tictactoes to both players simultaneously the rules declare that the player whose tictactoe has the lower maximum subscript earns one point and the player whose tictactoe has the higher maximum subscript earns only onehalf point

French ship Droits de lHomme 1794
Droits de lHomme  was a 74gun ship of the line of the French Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars Launched in 1794 the ship saw service in the Atlantic against the British Royal Navy

She was part of the fleet that sailed in December 1796 on the disastrous Expdition dIrlande After unsuccessful attempts to land troops on Ireland the Droits de lHomme headed back to her home port of Brest with the soldiers still on board Two British frigates were waiting to intercept stragglers from the fleet and engaged Droits de lHomme in the Action of 13 January 1797 Heavily damaged by the British ships and unable to manoeuvre in rough seas the ship struck a sandbar and was wrecked Hundreds of lives were lost in the disaster

The ship was built at PortLibert now Lorient and launched on 10 Prairial de lAn II 29 May 1794 Her name refers to the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen one of the founding documents of the French Revolution

Droits de lHomme was involved in the Action of 6 November 1794 chasing the British 74s and  Droits de lHomme caught up with Alexander first but was forced out of action with damage to her rigging but Alexander was soon caught by and and captured

Droits de lHomme was lightly involved in Battle of Groix on 22 June 1795 firing few if any shots during the battle

In December 1796 Droits de lHomme under capitaine de vaisseau Raymond de Lacrosse took part in the invasion attempt against Ireland carrying 549 soldiers On their way the fleet was dispersed by tempests The Droits de lHomme arrived at Bantry Bay and cruised off the coast capturing the brigs Cumberland and Calypso She stayed there for eight days to ascertain that no French ship was in distress on the coast and departed for Brittany
On 25 Nivse An V in the Action of 13 January 1797 off Penmarch Droits de lHomme met the British frigates 44 under Sir Edward Pellew and 36 commanded by Robert C Reynolds The sea was rough preventing Droits de lHomme from using her lower deck batteries and from boarding the British Lacrosse was wounded he gave command of the ship to his second officer Prvost de Lacroix and had his crew swear not to strike their colours

After 13 hours of combat running out of ammunition the British broke contact when Indefatigable sighted land ahead Indefatigable despite having damage to her masts and rigging managed to beat off the lee shore and escape Penmarch reefs Amazon ran aground and was destroyed near Plozvet and her crew captured Droits de lHomme having lost her rudder masts and anchors ran aground off Plozvet

Some of the crew were rescued by the ships boats and fishing boats from nearby villages but the rescue was interrupted for five days by the storm 60 men died for lack of food and water General JeanAmable Humbert who was commanding the soldiers aboard narrowly escaped drowning and between 250 and 390 men died in the wreck Captain Lacrosse was last to leave the ship

In 1840 Major Pipon an English officer who had been a prisoner aboard erected an inscribed menhir on the coast in remembrance of the tragedy In 1876 it was broken into several pieces by the weather but restored in 1882

Edward Augustus Russell House
The Edward Augustus Russell House is a Greek Revival house on the Wesleyan University campus The house at 318 High Street faces west from the east side of High Street north of the corner at High and Court Streets A large wooded lawn extends to the Honors College Russell House 1828 property to the north High Street between Church and Washington Streets was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown during the 19th century It was later home to the KNK Fraternity of Wesleyan University The structural system consists of loadbearing masonry with a flat roof and materials include brick and flushboarding walls and a brownstone foundation

This house was built in 18411842 for Edward A Russell 17971874 on a portion of the Russell family estate Edward Russell worked in the foreign mercantile trade until he returned to Middletown in 1838 He later served as mayor state representative and national convention delegate

Edward A Russell had personal contact with the firm of Town and Davis while supervising the building of the wellknown Greek Revival Russell House 1828 for his younger brother Samuel W Russell Thus it is possible that Edward retained the services of this firm when his house was built Such a possibility is reinforced by early photographs showing the original proportions and decoration These indicate that the house was a sophisticated and high style example of Greek Revival and stylistically close to the DeRham Brevoort House attributed to Davis in New York City and Highwood Henry Whitneys estate in New Haven 18351836 by Town and Davis

Edward Russells grandnephew Richard L deZeng 18471932 occupied the house until his death in 1932 Wesleyan purchased the property from the administrators of the estate of EA Russell and then sold it to Alpha Sigma Delta Alumni Association Inc in 1934 At this time the structure was altered for use as a fraternity house

The heavy cornice at the top of the building was lowered to the second floor and windows were placed above the cornice to form a full third floor Window cornices were removed and new window openings cut in the south facade The second and third floors were divided into three room suites however the first floor remains largely unaltered

This house was the last example of Greek Revival architecture to be built in the prestigious area of High Street

The house is currently used for lectures concerts and other special events and is preserved in good condition See httpwwwwesleyanedueventschedulingtherussellhousehtml

Fluid construction grammar
Fluid construction grammar FCG is an opensource computational construction grammar formalism that allows computational linguists to formally write down the inventory of lexical and grammatical constructions as well as to do experiments in language learning and language evolution FCG is an open instrument that can be used by construction grammarians who want to formulate their intuitions and data in a precise way and who want to test the implications of their grammar designs for language parsing production and learning The formalism can be tested through an interactive web interface at the FCG website

FCG integrates many notions from contemporary computational linguistics such as feature structure and unificationbased language processing but uses them in a novel way to operationalize insights from construction grammar theory Constructions are considered bidirectional and hence usable both for parsing and production Processing is flexible in the sense that FCG provides metalayer processing for coping with novelty partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences FCG is called fluid because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars The research on FCG is primarily carried out by Luc Steels and his teams at the VUB AI Lab in Brussels and the Language Evolution Lab in Barcelona and the Sony Computer Science Laboratories in Paris Besides Steels current and former contributors to the FCG formalism include Katrien Beuls Paul Van Eecke Remi van Trijp Joris Bleys Joachim De Beule Martin Loetzsch Nicolas Neubauer Michael Spranger Wouter Van den Broeck Pieter Wellens and others

FCG treats parsing and production as a search problem in which the FCG engine searches for the best utterance to verbalize a meaning language production or the best semantic network or meaning representation to analyze an utterance parsing Each state representation in the search process is called a Transient Structure A Transient Structure can be considered as an extended feature structure as it consists of a flat list of units that consist of a unitname a unique constant symbol and a unitbody a set of featurevalue pairs Older versions of FCG before 2011 used to split the transient structure into two separate poles for semantics and syntax but the current version implements a single representation for all linguistic information

FCG constructions or technically speaking construction schemas are treated as the operators of the search process That is by applying a construction to a transient structure a new transient structure or state representation in the search space may be created Just like transient structures constructions mostly consists of units of featurevalue pairs Constructions are however more structured because they contain two distinct parts

To decide whether a construction can apply the conditional part is matched against the current transient structure using a unificationbased algorithm In production only features that are part of the formulation locks of the construction must be matched against the transient structure whereas in parsing only features that are part of the comprehension locks will be considered If a match is successful the FCG engine will merge all of the units of featurevalue pairs with the transient structure in a similar unificationbased process

FCG features a metalayers of diagnostics repairs and consolidation strategies that allow the grammar designer to implement ways to handle novelty errors and unexpected input during processing These diagnostics and repairs can also be used for exploring the automated acquisition of new constructions

Satyanarayan Puja
The Satyanarayan Puja is a religious worship of the Hindu god Vishnu Satya means truth and narayana means The highest being so Satyanarayan means The highest being who is an embodiment of Truth Vrat or Puja means a religious vow religious observance or obligation
Hindus throughout perform Sri Satyanarayan Vrat for the divine blessings of health wealth prosperity opulence education relief from troubles and sickness It can also be performed because of success in business or career growth during social functions like marriages housewarming ceremonies naming of the children and so on

This puja is first mentioned in Skanda Purana Reva Kanda by Suta Puranik to the rishis in Naimisharanya The details are part of the Katha Story that is usually read during the ritual
Sri Satya Narayana puja is a very popular ritual in most parts of India including Assam Bengal Karnataka Andhra Pradesh Bihar Orissa Manipur

The ritual is usually performed on the Full moon day of every month Ekadashi 11th day after full moon or new moon Krtika Prim Vaikh Prim solar eclipse day or on Sakrnti except during ha Candra Masa It is also performed on special occasions and during times of achievements as an offering of gratitude to the Lord These occasions could include marriage graduation start of a new job purchase of a new home to name a few In addition the performance of this most auspicious puja generally confers a child to couples trying to start a family

The Satyanarayan puja can be performed on any day for any reason It is not a puja confined to any festivities but Purnima full moon day is considered specifically auspicious for this puja Performing this puja in the evening is considered more appropriate However one can perform this puja in the morning as well

This puja is very simple can be performed by anyone and it does not require a priest to perform it
The original concept was instructions given by rishi Narada Muni while on tour of earth he noticed tremendous amounts of sufferings all around due to malnutrition He went to lord Vishnu and described the situation and was told with instructions to perform Pooja and the other stories to be narrated One of the key instruction was to invite as many friends relatives and neighbors to attend the ceremony and to feed them and to offer as many types of fruits as possible and the sufferings will be eliminated and this was due to being well fed and consumption of fruits

The previous night think of Lord Sri Satyanarayana and mentally decide to perform puja the next day Invite your relatives and friends Tradition mandates to abstain from worldly pleasures

On the puja day early in the morning keeping the same thoughts of worshiping the Lord take a head bath If performing the evening again take a headbath This should be done by both husband and wife Wear a clean dress

Observe Fast if possible

Keep all the things for puja ready near the altar The total duration of the puja  start to finish  will be around 3 hours

Decorate the front door with mango leaves The place near the altar is cleaned with cow dung where possible

The Altar is placed in an EastWest direction such that the devotees performing the puja will be seated facing east It is decorated with floral designs usually using rice flour and other coloured powders A new white cloth is spread on the Altar and layered with raw rice 
A Kalash small pot made of Silver Copper Brass or even earthen is placed in the middle of Altar That small pot should add one betel nut one rupee coin some jwar or wheat and then filled it with holy water like gangajal if not available you can use clean water A coconut is placed on top and wrapped with a cloth5 Mango or ashok leaves are placed between the coconut and the pot After this a red thread kalava or moli is tied 3 round in neck of pot  Make a symbol of swastik in pot it is a good and positive symbol This too is decorated with Chandan Sandal paste and kumkumThis process is called kalash sthapna 

A framed picture of Lord Satyanarayana is placed on the far side of the Altar Flowers and garlands can be placed on this frame

Place all the puja items near the Altar

The devotees performing the puja will be seated facing the Altar

The airfield was opened in the early spring of 1943 and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Eighth and Ninth Air Forces

Chipping Ongar was known as USAAF Station AAF162 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war and by which it was referred to instead of location Its USAAF Station Code was JC

USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Chipping Ongar were

Parts of the airfield were still under construction when the 387th Bombardment Group Medium arrived from Goodman AAF Kentucky on 25 June 1943 The group was assigned to the 3d Bomb Wing and flew B26BC Marauders Operational squadrons of the 387th were

Bulgarian nouns
Bulgarian nouns have the categories grammatical gender number case only vocative and definiteness A noun has one of three specific grammatical genders masculine feminine neuter and two numbers singular and plural With cardinal numbers and some adverbs masculine nouns use a separate count form Definiteness is expressed by a definite article which is postfixed to the noun

Nouns can be formed from other words by means of suffixes Some important suffixes that are used to form nouns are

In Bulgarian nouns have three genders masculine feminine and neuter The gender is an inherent characteristic of every noun This means that each noun is masculine feminine or neuter Only nouns referring to people or animals can change their gender In most cases the gender of the noun can be determined according to its ending but there arent any strict rules Masculines are all the nouns which refer to male people or animals and many more
Nouns referring to people or animals can change their gender from masculine to feminine by
adding the suffixes    
The gender of nouns that have no singular form cant be determined   

Some nouns have changed gender with time for example the feminine vecher evening it retains its masculine character in the phrase dobur vecher  good evening or var lime Some words in spoken Bulgarian at least can take either gender eg domatdomata tomato mascfem or sandalsandala sandal some can take either gender with slight variations in meaning eg gaz gas or prah dust while others usually for etymological reasons can have completely different meanings eg med means honey in the masculine and copper in the feminine or prust meaning finger masc or soil fem

A noun has singular  and plural  number  Unlike in English where almost all nouns add s in the plural in Bulgarian there are many endings and despite of the rules listed below one cannot be absolutely sure which ending to use with which noun Besides when forming the plural some nouns alter additionally That is why a noun should always be learnt together with its plural form Generally if the noun ends in a vowel it is removed before adding the plural suffix Sometimes the stress changes position

Masculine nouns which end in a consonant have another plural form besides their usual one This form is called count form or numerical form   broyna forma and is used only after cardinal numbers and the adverbs  how many  thisthatso many  severala fewsome         versus   An exception to this occurs in some exclamations following  when the ordinary plural is used and the inferred meaning is what a large amount of eg   kolko konya how many horses  numeric plural but   kolko kone  ordinary plural implying look at all those horses

The count form is formed with the endings  and  and unlike the usual plural form without any additional changes no losing of the sounds  and  no change of consonants etc except for stress moving it never falls on the last syllable so if it is on the last syllable in the singular it will move on the penultimate in the count form and metathesis of  in the letter group 

There are also a handful of neuter nouns for parts of the body which also take a count form ramo shoulder  ramene  2 ramena kolyano knee  kolene  2 kolena



The count form is avoided with nouns denoting persons and in such cases the usual plural form is much more preferred    how many students   eight students

The usual form is also used after masculine numbers in Bulgarian some cardinal numbers have gender ending in  these forms of the numbers are used only with male persons not with other masculine nouns denoting inanimate objects    two students   five students

Some nouns have irregular plural forms

Some neuter nouns have two or more plural forms most of them with no difference in meaning For example   and    and    and    and    and     and    and  Some plural forms refer to different meanings   fuel wood   trees some are used in specific contexts the variants  from   from  are found only in the poetry

In Bulgarian there are some nouns that are only in the singular they are uncountable Such nouns are some abstract words   materialism   security  love some collective words   students chemical elements and some other substances   hydrogen   carbon   semolina   rice etc There are also words which have only plural forms These are nouns referring to objects composed of two identical parts   glasses   scissors and some concepts and objects consisting of many elements   coal   finances   money

In Bulgarian nouns have the grammatical category definiteness  The morphological indicator of definiteness is the presence of a special morpheme called definite article   The definite article is placed after the noun and is written together with it The using of the definite article in Bulgarian is called 


There is an additional discrepancy between pronunciation and spelling when the stress of some monosyllabic masculine nouns falls on the definite articles  or 

In Bulgarian masculine and feminine nouns have two cases  Nominative   and Vocative   The vocative is used when addressing a person or a thing in all other cases the nominative is used Theoretically all masculine and feminine nouns can be declined in the vocative but vocative forms are used mainly with personal names and with nouns denoting people

Feminine nouns which end in a consonant do not have vocative forms

There is a difference in usage between vocative forms of common nouns and proper nouns The former are used always when addressing someone and the use of nominative forms instead is immediately perceived as a gross error

The latter however are considered informal and are used less frequently especially the
vocative forms of female personal names ending in  which are even considered by some to be rude or rustic   Nevertheless nominative forms especially the male ones sound too formal even snobbish and are used rarely by native speakers Instead diminutives   or short forms   are preferred Diminutives are used usually by elder people when addressing younger ones

Male vocative forms and female ones ending in  are used regularly and their substitution with nominative forms is also considered a gross error or the speaker may sound too snobbish

There is difference between the vocative form of both male and female short name forms and their other nonvocative form the form that is used in all other cases The latter takes the definite article  or  depending on the ending

Land banking
Land banking is the practice of aggregating parcels of land for future sale or development

While in many countries land banking may refer to various private realestate investment schemes in the United States it refers to the establishment of quasigovernmental county or municipal authorities purposed with managing an inventory of surplus land

Land banks are quasigovernmental entities created by counties or municipalities to effectively manage and repurpose an inventory of underused abandoned or foreclosed property They are often chartered to have powers that enable them to accomplish these goals in ways that existing government agencies can not While the land bank model has gained broad support and has been implemented in a number of cities they are implemented differently so as to best address both municipal needs and the state and local legal context in which they were created

The period of deindustrialization in the United States coupled with increased suburbanization in the middle of the 20th century left many American cities with large amounts of vacant  blighted industrial residential and commercial property Beginning in the early 1970s municipalities began to seek solutions to manage decline or spur revitalization in once prosperous city neighborhoods The first land bank was created in St Louis in 1971 While additional municipalities continued to adopt them at a trickle it wasnt until the mid 2000s that land banks became viewed as a tested reliable and accepted model and experienced widespread implementation  particularly after the success of the Genesee County Land Bank In 2009 the Department of Housing and Urban Development issued a report embracing land banks as a best practices model for municipalities dealing with the effects of the real estate market collapse and the ensuing foreclosure crisis

Land banking in the UK was previously the preserve of the landed gentry or real estate developers Many reputable listed commercial building companies engage successfully in land banking for future building projects Companies also purchase land sites and easily divide them into smaller plots then offer these plots for sale to individual investors This relatively new practice in the UK does not fall under the control of the Financial Services Authority Many people are wary of this form of investment as many plot based land banking companies have failed or been closed down There are currently no audited successes recorded for UK plot based land banking despite the UK having gone through a major property boom in the period 2002  Jul 2007

A landbanking scheme that is a Collective investment scheme is a regulated activity for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and according to section 191 may only be operated in the UK by a person who is either authorised or exempt Section 26 provides that an agreement made by a person in contravention of this is unenforceable and any sums paid to him may be recovered together with compensation for any loss suffered After recent FSA enforcement of this regulation many companies selling UK land plots have moved outside of the European Union and only offer land plots to non UK residents who are not protected by FSA regulations

Since the changes in the land registration act a number of companies offering UK land plots as an investment have been formed Typically this land is greenbelt nature conservation flood plain agricultural or protected land unsuitable for development There are no recorded successful planning permission applications for plots sold under such collective investment schemes

There have been considerable losses recorded by investors in UK land plot investment schemes A large number of British companies offering UK land plots have failed or been shut down by the FSA or other authorities
Some companies have now moved offshore after FSA investigation Some companies now offer UK land plots from locations such as Dubai or Singapore where the local authorities do not regulate such activities or are not aware of the high risk nature of the investment In June 2010 the Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS issued a warning on land banking plots schemes warning they may be a scam with specific focus on companies offering land from the UK and Canada

A company representative may contact an individual by telephone in temporary shopping center booths or at property shows and offer a strategic land investment in the UK Very often UK government or industry statistics the proximity of the land to built up areas or the recent history of UK house prices are quoted as a demonstration of why the land plot is a great investment Verbal communication will often indicate that the land is fast tracked for building approval and has strong potential as building land When pricing the land reference is typically made to approved building land prices at the market peak Very often the land banking company will present detailed plans showing a housing development on the site These plans are often referred to as preapproved concept or predevelopment The sales person will focus on the potential future value of the land against the current selling price

No reference is ever made to the value of green belt or agricultural land or the issues involved with the long term maintenance and collectively selling tiny plots of land The sales price is typically uplifted 10100 times over the current value of the land Plans shown have no validity in UK planning law and cannot be considered as any indication of progress in the planning process No written contractual promise is ever given for planning permission despite typically extreme optimism by the sales person The sales person will typically never mention that the land is protected or greenbelt land and cannot be developed under current planning regulations There is typically no possibility of planning permission in any reasonable timeframe

The investor may end up paying a considerable amount of money for a small area of low value land which has a very high risk of standing undeveloped Once the general public becomes aware of the lack of viability of the proposed plot investment scheme the resale value of the individual plots collapses This is typically followed by the land plot company liquidating completely or relocating to another legal jurisdiction

For customers that show a willingness to purchase such schemes there may also be attempts to sell additional plot based land banking products at alternate locations or other high yield investment programmes Customers may also be added to suckers lists which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor

A You and Yours documentary first aired on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006 criticized the services offered by many land banking companies in the United Kingdom suggesting that they were scamming their customers A land banking scam is based on the very low chance of any of the plots receiving planning permission and the very high profit margins taken on the land plots with the seller using misleading marketing tactics to convince the buyers that they are making a sound investment

A key strategy used for selling United Kingdom land plots is to imply that because a customer owns the land plot they cannot lose their money The land banking company typically suggests dramatic annual increases in the value of the land plots and a very optimistic time frame for successful planning applications These are never contractually committed Typically the land banking company sells a land plot at a premium of 15 to 100 times the current market value of undeveloped land A purchaser might pay 15000 for a land plot that only has a current market value of 500 On this basis most of the investment is not in land and the small percentage annual increases in the value of the land plot are meaningless The actual investment is in a proposed service to deliver valuable approved building land in the future If that service is never delivered or is not successful the remaining land asset is normally worthless Should the selling company fail or disappear the plot owner cannot economically sell the plot as the administrative effort and cost of sale typically exceeds the value of the land plot

Many land banking companies target victims outside of the United Kingdom particularly Canada Singapore Thailand Brunei and Malaysia Residents of these countries may be naive of the UK property market and local planning regulations such as green belt zoning

In 2008 the land banking firm UKLI was placed into administration due to insolvency despite having taken 69 million from 4500 people for land plots Land International was closed down in 2008 after losing investors 10 million and the same Land International plots were later offered for sale in Asia In 2010 Land International Far East failed causing investors to lose S6 million 25M MP David Heath requested a debate in the House of Commons following the offering of 209 plots in the village of Dean saying that while land banking may not be illegal it is undoubtedly a scam

The UK Land Registry issued a press release on January 15 2009 advising consumers that the Land Registry has published a guide warning against land banking investment schemes Land Registry Head of Corporate Legal Services Mike Westcott Rudd said that the public were being misled about the prospects of obtaining planning permission with wellknown banks and developers being falsely cited as partners in the project and that in some cases forged Land Registry paperwork was being presented to suggest that planning approval existed where it did not

In 2011 New York State passed a land bank statute authorizing the establishment of nonprofits in each county to take title to vacant abandoned homes so they can be rehabilitated sold or demolished in an orderly fashion Many counties upstate including Erie County Onondaga County Schenectady County and Albany County have abandoned homes as people moved to the suburbs Some properties have been abandoned due to back taxes and the city has taken title 

The recent robosigning settlement gave Attorney General Eric Schneiderman the wherewithal to fund land banks in Schenectady and Albany 

The state of Michigan also has a land bank program  Ohio passed land bank legislation in 2009

Land banking as an investment is nothing new to America Several selfmade billionaires started by purchasing large tracts in California where the development opportunities had not yet arisen People such as Bob Hope and Donald Trump have reaped tremendous reward from buying large areas and holding the property until the market commanded a considerable return when sold There have however also been many land scams in the US such as the large areas of Florida swampland which were sold as being suitable for real estate

Florida land scams have history as far back as the 1920s Florida Land Rush Many Florida Counties have traces of these land scams today Polk County Florida in particular has been devastated with land banking scams Polk County being the land that lies between the city of Tampa in Hillsborough County Florida and the city of Orlando in Orange County Florida has been a hot bed for speculative land development North Polk County falls within the lower Green Swamp The State of Florida has declared the Green Swamp land of critical state concern During the 1970s through the late 1980s the Green Swamp was sold as being suitable for real estate development The development of Disney World and the attraction it received was the sales tool to persuade individuals to buy one acre lots at high speculative prices These prices ranged from 2000 to as high as 15000 per acre The Florida land banking scams continue today and are mostly operated outside of the United States Unwary foreign customers are sold Florida land from outside the US borders through contracts for deed arrangements

In December 2008 at the depths of the Global Financial Crisis the Foreign Investment Review Board FIRB relaxed laws regarding foreign investment in Australian real estate Under previous legislation temporary residents were only allowed to purchase a property for Principal Place of Residence purposes valued at up to 300000 Under new laws active since February 2009 this monetary limit has been removed

In March 2010 the Reserve Bank of Australia governor announced that it is monitoring the effect of the rule change on the housing market

On April 24 2010 Assistant Treasurer Senator Nick Sherry announced the tightening of foreign investment laws as a result of a public backlash to the changes made a year earlier Whilst they are still entitled to purchase a property of any value temporary Residents must now sell their residence upon leaving the country and must report all purchases to the Foreign Investment Review Board effectively eliminating this land banking loophole However foreign companies are allowed to purchase property to house local staff

It is possible for foreign individuals to create a registered company for the sole purpose of purchasing property in Australia and actively bypass the loophole fix

As of April 20 2010 the COAG has agreed the Housing Supply and Affordability Reform Working Party will extend the land audit work to examine underused examine private holdings of large parcels of land by mid2010

While most land banking is based on the prospect of urban areas expanding at the expense of rural areas in various parts of the world agricultural land is expanding at the expense of virgin land The purchase of virgin land that has been identified as suitable for agriculture because of its climate topography and soil properties where the buyer has no intention to work the land himself or lease it out would be agricultural land banking

Such lands are often rather far away from existing infrastructure when purchased by the land banking investor therefore prices being low The investor anticipates that because of the areas natural productive potential an agricultural infrastructure sufficient roads specialised contractors grain storages will develop with more land put under cultivation and land values multiplying

Agricultural land banking is found where large tracts of fertile virgin land still exist where valuations are low and where legislation allows large land holdings free hold by domestic and foreign investors
Typical countries for such investments during recent years have been Argentina Brazil Uruguay
Paraguay where land prices appreciated accordingly

Though the perception that the worlds fertile land is a limited and valuable asset is by no means new it received renewed public and media attention with the global food crisis when phrases like peak wheat or peak soil
were coined

Mexborough Ferry Boat Halt railway station
Mexborough Ferry Boat Halt was a small railway station on the South Yorkshire Railways line between Barnsley and Doncaster in South Yorkshire England It was intended to serve the township of Mexborough and the village parish of Old Denaby where it was situated
the boundary being the River Don It was close by the Ferry Boat crossing of the river and the swing bridge over the canal a short distance from the original centre of Mexborough around where the parish church now stands

At this point the line is crossed by a footpath which connects Mexborough to Old Denaby Access to the platform was from this path The railway was controlled by a signal box known as Ferry Boat Crossing

It is believed that the station closed along with Mexborough Junction railway station on the opening of the new present day Mexborough station in 1871

Suppressor mutation
A suppressor mutation is a second mutation that alleviates or reverts the phenotypic effects of an already existing mutation in a process defined synthetic rescue Genetic suppression therefore restores the phenotype seen prior to the original background mutation Suppressor mutations are useful for identifying new genetic sites which affect a biological process of interest They also provide evidence between functionally interacting molecules and intersecting biological pathways

Intragenic suppression results from suppressor mutations that occur in the same gene as the original mutation In a classic study Francis Crick et al used intragenic suppression to study the fundamental nature of the genetic code From this study it was shown that genes are expressed as nonoverlapping triplets codons 
Researchers showed that mutations caused by either a single base insertion  or a single base deletion  could be suppressed or restored by a second mutation of the opposite sign as long as the two mutations occurred in the same vicinity of the gene This led to the conclusion that genes needed to be read in a specific reading frame and a single base insertion or deletion would shift the reading frame frameshift mutation in such a way that the remaining DNA would code for a different polypeptide than the one intended Therefore researchers concluded that the second mutation of opposite sign suppresses the original mutation by restoring the reading frame as long as the portion between the two mutations is not critical for protein function 

In addition to the reading frame Crick also used suppressor mutations to determine codon size It was found that while one and two base insertionsdeletions of the same sign resulted in a mutant phenotype deleting or inserting three bases could give a wild type phenotype From these results it was concluded that an inserted or deleted triplet does not disturb the reading frame and the genetic code is in fact a triplet

Intergenic also known as extragenic suppression relieves the effects of a mutation in one gene by a mutation somewhere else within the genome The second mutation is not on the same gene as the original mutation Intergenic suppression is useful for identifying and studying interactions between molecules such as proteins For example a mutation which disrupts the complementary interaction between protein molecules may be compensated for by a second mutation elsewhere in the genome that restores or provides a suitable alternative interaction between those molecules Several proteins of biochemical signal transduction and gene expression pathways have been identified using this approach Examples of such pathways include receptorligand interactions as well as the interaction of components involved in DNA replication transcription and translation

Suppressor mutations also occur in genes that code for virus structural proteins To create a viable phage T4 virus see image a balance of structural components is required An amber mutant of phage T4 contains a mutation that changes a codon for an amino acid in a protein to the nonsense stop codon TAG see stop codon and nonsense mutation If upon infection an amber mutant defective in a gene encoding a needed structural component of phage T4 is weakly suppressed in an E coli host containing a specific altered tRNA  see nonsense suppressor it will produce a reduced number of the needed structural component As a consequence few if any viable phage are formed However it was found that viable phage could sometimes be produced in the host with the weak nonsense suppressor if a second amber mutation in a gene that encodes another structural protein is also present in the phage genome It was found that the reason the second amber mutation could suppress the first one is that the two numerically reduced structural proteins would now be in balance For instance if the first amber mutation caused a reduction of tail fibers to one tenth the normal level most phage particles produced would have insufficient tail fibers to be infective However if a second amber mutation is defective in a base plate component and causes one tenth the number of base plates to be made this may restore the balance of tail fibers and base plates and thus allow infective phage to be produced

In microbial genetics a revertant is a mutant that has reverted to its former genotype or to the original phenotype by means of a suppressor mutation or else by compensatory mutation somewhere in the gene second site reversion

Landmarks of Montreal
Montreals Underground City French La ville souterraine is the set of underground city complexes in and around downtown It is also known as the indoor city ville intrieure as not all of it is underground With over of tunnels spread over an area of  the 60 residential and commercial complexes comprise of floor space including 80 of all office space and 35 of all commercial space in downtown Montreal Services include shopping malls hotels banks offices museums universities seven metro stations two commuter train stations a bus terminal and the Bell Centre hockey arena There are more than 120 exterior access points to the underground city Some 500000 people use the underground city every day especially to escape the traffic andor Montreals harsh winter

The Olympic installations site is next to Metro PieIX and Metro Viau from downtown in the HochelagaMaisonneuve district and consists of several buildings designed by French architect Roger Taillibert The Olympic Stadium is ovoid shaped with a distinctive ribbed look and has the worlds tallest inclined tower at high it leans at 45 degrees The complex includes the Montreal Biodome originally a fully functional Velodrome the Montreal Insectarium municipal golf course Le Village and the Montreal Botanical Garden one of the largest botanical gardens in the world second only to Royal Botanic Gardens Kew in England Two pyramidal towers known as the Olympic Village were built to house athletes but now serve as apartments and offices

The Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics were successful but construction problems and corruption created a massive financial burden for citizens At the opening the tower and the retractable roof were incomplete The tower was completed years later but the retractable roof was never completed as originally planned by Taillibert Anglo locals refer to the stadium as the Big O due to its shape but also as the Big Owe  a reference to the Olympic Parks exorbitant total cost which was only paid off thirty years later with the help of a special tobacco tax

The stadium was also home to the Expos from 1977 until the team moved to Washington DC after the 2004 season and has sometimes been home for the Montreal Alouettes Today Montreals Olympic Park hosts limited professional sports events and is mainly a tourist and cultural attraction

Montreal hosted the 2006 1st World Outgames holding the openingclosing ceremonies and many of the events at the Olympic Stadium The event drew over 10000 participants Most were Gay athletes but many participated in other cultural events such as ballroom dancing Opening ceremonies brought international athletes local politicians and entertainers

Montreal is the centre of Quebec culture and a major centre of Canadian culture in general It has many specialized museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts MMFA the Muse dart contemporain MAC the Redpath Museum the Stewart Museum the McCord Museum of Canadian History and the Canadian Centre for Architecture The Place des Arts cultural complex houses the MAC and several theatres and is the seat of the Montreal Opera and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra although the latter is slated to receive a new concert hall adjacent to Place des Arts The Museum Quarters historical and architectural richness spilling over into surrounding streets creates a special ambiance that leaves a lasting impression on visitors Crescent de la Montagne and Sherbrooke Streets are the hub of the districts vibrant business life Highend designer fashion and dcor boutiques international shops art galleries jewellers and exquisite fine dining never fail to win visitors over

Nicknamed la ville aux cent clochers the city of a hundred belltowers Montreal is renowned for its churches As described by Mark Twain This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldnt throw a brick without breaking a church window The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas Mary Queen of the World Cathedral the aforementioned NotreDame Basilica St Patricks Basilica and Saint Josephs Oratory
The Oratory is the largest church in Canada with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peters Basilica in Rome

Other wellknown churches include the pilgrimage church of NotreDameduBonSecours which is sometimes called the Sailors Church the Church of St Michael and St Anthony known for its Byzantine architecture and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral which was completely excavated and suspended in midair during the construction of part of the Underground City All of the above are major tourist destinations particularly NotreDame and the Oratory

An impressive number of other churches synagogues and mosques can be found and church steeples are a familiar view all over the city and island

Mount Royal is Montreals outstanding urban park designed in 1876 by Frederick Law Olmsted best known as the designer of New Yorks Central Park Mount Royals features include the Chalet and the Kondiaronk Belvedere overlooking downtown Montreal the most famous view of the city and manmade Beaver Lake Lac aux Castors with its recently renovated pavilion Mount Royal is topped by an illuminated cross that has become a Montreal landmark

Observant hikers on the parks many trails will find an abundance of small wildlife In the winter the park is the site of numerous crosscountry ski trails and a new refrigerated skating rink near Beaver Lake

Once a funicular railroad brought sightseers to its peak but has long since disappeared A tramway also went up the mountain on the north side replaced in the late 1950s by the Camillien Houde Parkway which now bisects the mountain the parkway is named for longtime but controversial former mayor jailed during World War II for his opposition to conscription in Canada The 11Montagne bus line perpetuates the route of the tram

Every Sunday in the summer hundreds of people gather at the Georgetienne Cartier Monument a statue of Confederation cofounder Georgetienne Cartier at the foot of Mount Royal for several hours of drumming dancing and juggling among many other activities in an event known as the TamTams It is unclear how this event started but as it has no formal organization and has carried on both in a lively and peaceful way since at least the late 1980s

The intersection of Avenue du Parc and Avenue des Pins just to the south formerly a winding urban interchange inspired by the New York parkways of Robert Moses underwent a major transformation to become more pedestrianfriendly

Located in the middle of the St Lawrence River Parc JeanDrapeau consists of the islands of SainteHlne and the manmade NotreDame which hosted Expo 67 A large green space with diverse attractions and events Parc JeanDrapeau is accessible by mtro car bicycle or boat The islands are a popular destination for Montrealers due to their green spaces and sports and cultural activities

The Floralies gardens are located at the centre of the island le NotreDame also has a network of canals and further west at the lake offers a beach and other water sports The Casino de Montral and a youth hostel are also located here The Montreal Grand Prix takes place here at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve which in winter is used as a skating rink

Dominated by the geodesic dome of the Biosphre and the rollercoasters of Six Flags La Ronde the island is also home to the Hlne de Champlain restaurant and the De Lvis tower Built in 1814 the Fort on Saint Helens Island houses the Stewart Museum dedicated to the history of New France The island also contains several large public works of art such as the imposing Man sculpted in steel by artist Alexander Calder Buses run every 15 minutes from the JeanDrapeau metro station to La Ronde

Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America
The Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America AILLA is a digital repository housed in LLILAS Benson Latin American Studies and Collections at the University of Texas at Austin AILLA is a digital language archive dedicated to the digitization and preservation of primary data such as audio and video recordings field notes texts and photographs that are in or about Latin American indigenous languages and cultures AILLAs holdings are available on the Internet and are open to the public wherever privacy and intellectual property concerns are met AILLA has access portals in both English and Spanish all metadata are available in both languages as well as in indigenous languages whenever these metadata are provided

In this global media age more and more indigenous languages are being superseded by global languages such as Spanish English and Portuguese Frequently audio andor video recordings made by community members and speakers as well as by researchers such as linguists anthropologists and ethnomusicologists are the only record of these languages These recordings might be stored in university offices or in private homes where they are not accessible to others AILLA provides a permanent home for these recordings in order to make them available to the speakers and to the rest of the world via the Internet 

AILLAs mission is threefold


The collection currently contains roughly 7500 hours of archived audio materials representing more than 300 languages from at least 28 countries This is supplemented by a significant number of images videos and text files Altogether the archive contains more than 110000 individual files correct as of June 2016

The database of archived materials can be freely searched via both the English and Spanish portals available on the AILLA webpage as well as the Open Languages Archives Community Direct access to archived recordings requires free registration and sometimes needs permission as specified by the depositor Downloads are free of charge

A large part of the project is the digitization of valuable analog recordings of languages and cultures from the Latin America that will otherwise deteriorate or be lost Researchers whose materials are represented in these collections include Terrence Kaufman Lyle Campbell and Nora England among many others

Analog recordings are digitized at the highest possible fidelity to ensure highquality digital files result The current international archive standard for PCM audio files is 24bit resolution and a sample rate of 96kHz AILLA employs the same standard to ensure that digital copies of the highest practicable fidelity are produced

AILLA is funded by the College of Liberal Arts and the University of Texas Libraries at The University of Texas at Austin AILLAs main office is located at the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection The archive is currently headed by Susan Smythe Kung Joel Sherzer Anthony C Woodbury and Patience Epps

AILLA was founded in 2001 by Joel Sherzer professor emeritus in the Department of Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin The archive is a member of the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network DELAMAN AILLA is an archive of record for the Documenting Endangered Languages program of the National Science Foundation

Georg Bednorz
Johannes Georg Bednorz born May 16 1950 is a German physicist who together with K Alex Mller discovered hightemperature superconductivity in ceramics for which they shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physics

Bednorz was born in Neuenkirchen North RhineWestphalia Germany to elementaryschool teacher Anton and piano teacher Elisabeth Bednorz as the youngest of four children His parents were both from Silesia in Central Europe but were forced to move westwards in turbulences of World War II

As a child his parents tried to get him interested in classical music but he was more practically inclined preferring to work on motorcycles and cars Although as a teenager he did eventually learn to play the violin and trumpet In high school he developed an interest in the natural sciences focusing on chemistry which he could learn in a handson manner through experiments

In 1968 Bednorz enrolled at the University of Mnster to study chemistry However he soon felt lost in the large body of students and opt to switch to the much less popular subject of crystallography a subfield of mineralogy at the interface of chemistry and physics In 1972 his teachers Wolfgang Hoffmann and Horst Bhm arranged for him to spend the summer at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory as a visiting student The experience here would shape his further career not only did he meet his later collaborator K Alex Mller the head of the physics department but he also experienced the atmosphere of creativity and freedom cultivated at the IBM lab which he credits as a strong influence on his way of conducting science

After another visit in 1973 he came to Zurich in 1974 for six months to do the experimental part of his diploma work Here he grew crystals of SrTiO a ceramic material belonging to the family of perovskites Mller himself interested in perovskites urged him to continue his research and after obtaining his masters degree from Mnster in 1977 Bednorz started a PhD at the ETH Zurich Swiss Federal Institute of Technology under supervision of Heini Grnicher and Alex Mller In 1978 his future wife Mechthild Wennemer whom he had met in Mnster followed him to Zrich to start her own PhD

In 1982 after obtaining his PhD he joined the IBM lab There he joined Mllers ongoing research on superconductivity In 1983 Bednorz and Mller began a systematic study of the electrical properties of ceramics formed from transition metal oxides and in 1986 they succeeded in inducing superconductivity in a lanthanum barium copper oxide LaBaCuO also known as LBCO The oxides critical temperature T was 35 K a full 12 K higher than the previous record This discovery stimulated a great deal of additional research in hightemperature superconductivity on cuprate materials with structures similar to LBCO soon leading to the discovery of compounds such as BSCCO T 107K and YBCO T 92K

In 1987 Bednorz and Mller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their important breakthrough in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials In the same year Bednorz was appointed an IBM Fellow

Muted group theory
Muted Group Theory MGT created by Edwin Ardener and Shirley Ardener in 1975 is a communication theory that focuses on how marginalized groups are muted and excluded via the use of language The main idea of MGT is that Language serves its creators better than those in other groups who have to learn to use the language as best they can

The term mutedness refers to a groups inability to express themselves due to this inequity The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate groups as being as follows 1 the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system including the social norms and vocabulary and 2 members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant language to express themselves However this translation process may result in the loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly The dominant group may also ignore the voice of the marginalized group All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group Although this theory was initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages

Muted Group Theory was firstly developed in the field of cultural anthropology by the British anthropologist Edwin Ardener The first formulation of MGT emerges from one of Edwin Ardeners short essays entitled Belief and the Problem of Women in which Ardener explored the problem of women In social anthropology the problem of women is divided in two parts technical and analytical The technical problem is that although half of the population and society is technically made up of women ethnographers have often ignored this half of the population Ardener writes that those trained in ethnography evidently have a bias towards the kinds of model that men are ready to provide or to concur in rather than towards any that women might provide He also suggests that the reason behind this is that men tend to give a bounded model of society akin to the ones that ethnographers are attracted to Therefore men are those who produce and control symbolic production in a society This leads to the analytical part of the problem which attempts to answer the question  if the models of society made by most ethnographers tend to be models derived from the male portion of that society how does the symbolic weight of the other mass of persons express itself

After conducting an experiment with the information in his essay the results indicated that the male point of view is the dominant point of view in society which is why it is depicted with a standard solid line in this graph On the other hand the female point of view is considered as nondominant and nonstandard so it falls into the muted category with the broken line According to Ardener because malebased understandings of society represent the dominant worldview certain groups are silenced or muted He writes In these terms if the male perception yields a dominant structure the female one is a muted structure As part of the critical approach to the world Ardener uses MGT to explore the power and societal structure in relation to the dynamism between dominant and subordinated groups Moreover Ardeners concept of muted groups does not only apply to women but can also be applied to other nondominant groups within social structures

Scholars Cheris Kramerae Barrie Thorne and Nancy Henley were interested in exploring ways language defines deprecrates and ignores women What they discovered is that male dominance affects more than just the way sexes speak but the content and structure of the English language Women are often defined by their relation to men MissMrs or Harolds Widow while men have more autonomous varied linguistic status

Mutedness does not equal silence Mutedness occurs when people cannot articulate their ideas regardless of time and space without changing their language to meet the dominant groups vocabulary Mutedness results from the lack of power and might lead to being overlooked muffled and invisible As gender communication scholar Cheris Kramarae states social interaction and communication create the current language structure Because the latter was mainly built by men men have an advantage over women Consequently women cannot express their thoughts through their own words because their language use is limited by the rules of a mans language Kramarae states

The language of a particular culture does not serve all its speakers equally for not all speakers contribute in an equal fashion to its formulation Women as well as members of other nondominant groups are not as free or as able as men are to say what they wish because the words and the norms for their use have been formulated by the dominant group men

As Cowan points out  mutedness does not refer to the absence of voice but to a kind of distortion where subordinate voicesare allowed to speak but only in the confines of the dominant communication system

Muted group or subordinated group is relative to the dominant group According to Gerdrin muting or silencing is a social phenomenon based on the tacit understanding that within a society there are dominant and nondominant groups Thus the muting process is a socially shared phenomenon that presupposes a collective understanding of who is in power and who is not The discrepancies in power result in the oppressor and the oppressed Kramarae points out that muted group as the oppressed are people who dont have a public recognized vocabulary to express their experience Their failure in articulate their ideas lead to their doubt about the validity of their experience and the legitimacy of their feelings Kramarae also addresses that gender race and class hierarchies where muted groups are supported by our political educational religious legal and media systems Due to the lack of power muted groups are usually at the margin of the society

Several scholars have researched and studied how the muting process occurs Houston and Kramarae posit that women have been silenced in many ways by for example ridiculing womens related lexicon reinforcing family hierarchies constructing a malecontrolled media trivializing their opinions ideas and concerns and censoring womens voices A central factor that contributes to these silencing methods is the trivialization of the lexicon and speech patterns that is often used to describe female activities

According to West and Turner 2010 individuals can use the following strategies to avoid the muting process 

According to Cheris Kramarae MGT makes three assumptions 

The different experiences caused by the division of labor result in the different perceptions that women and men hold towards the world

Using mens words is a disadvantage to women because Kramarae believes that men and women are vastly different and thus will view the world differently from each other This stems from the distinction between the meanings of the words sex and gender Kramerae believes that communication between men and women is not on an even level This is because language is man made This makes it easier for men to communicate over women Symbolic Interactionism Theory believes that the extent of knowing is the extent of naming When applied to muted group this means women have an extreme disadvantage over men because men are the namers

Women find it difficult to articulate their ideas as mens experience are dominant

Kramarae argues that English is a humanmade language and that it embodies the perspectives of the masculine more than the feminine while supporting the perceptions of white middleclass males Men are the standard In other words Kramerae argues that men use language to dominate women so that womens voices become less present or muted Kramarae also explains that mens control over language has produced an abundance of derogatory words for women and their speech patterns Some of these include names such as slut whore and easy lay along with speech patterns such as gossiping whining and bitching When it comes to words connoting promiscuity there are fewer malespecific terms and the ones that do exist are seen in a positivesexual light These include words such as stud player and pimp p465 Kramarae suggests these harmful words shape our reality She believes that words constantly ignored may eventually come to be unspoken and perhaps even unthought This can lead women to doubt themselves and the intentions of their feelings Women are at a disadvantage once again

Women have to go through a translation process when speaking in order to participate in social life

Kramarae says that women need to choose their words carefully in public According to Kramarae this is because what women want to say and can say best cannot be said easily because the language template is not of their own making Another example of the maledominated language Kramarae brings up is that in public speaking women most often use sports and war analogies things most women do not usually associate themselves with in order to relate to their male audiences This stems from the market being dominated by males for so long Almost all prominent authors theorists and scientists have historically been male This allows for them to give women the facts they should believe about society and life in general Kramarae also believes that males have more difficulty than females in understanding what members of the other gender mean Feminist scholar Dale Spender supports the idea that language and society in general is traditionally malecentric Masculinity is the unmarked form the assumption is that the world is male unless proven otherwise Femininity is the marked form it is the proof of otherwise If masculinity and subsequently language are unmarked forms than any marked form must go through a translation process in order to participate in social life

According to Kissack traditionally communication has been constructed within the framework of a male dominated society Women in corporate organizations are expected to use language associated with women that is femalepreferential language It has been considered as lower than the malepreferential language The primary difference between the two is malepreferential language consists of details such as opinions and facts whereas femalepreferential language consists mainly of personal details emotions reflected in the conversations also there is a great use of adjectives in it

Muted group theory has recognized that womens voices are muted in Western society so that their experiences are not fully represented in language and has argued that womens experiences merit linguistic recognition Kramarae states that in order to change muted group status we also need to change dictionaries Traditional dictionaries rely on the majority of their information to come from male literary sources These male sources have the power to exclude words important to or created by women Furthering this idea Kramarae and Paula Treichler created A Feminist Dictionary with words they believed MerriamWebster defined on male ideas For example the word Cuckold is defined as the husband of an unfaithful wife in Merriam Webster However there is no term for a wife who has an unfaithful husband She is simply called a wife Another example Kramarae defined was the word doll She defined doll as a toy playmate given to or made by children Some adult males continue their childhood by labeling adult female companions dolls The feminist dictionary includes up to 2500 words to emphasize womens linguistic ability and to give women words of empowerment and change their muted status Long argues that words can shape reality and feelings She also believes that women can grab opportunities to take up physical and political space if they are given more verbal space

According to Kramarae women have been locked out of the publishing business until 1970 thus they lacked influence on mass media and have often been misrepresented in history The reason behind this lies in the predominance of male gatekeepers who are defined as editors and other arbiters of a culture who determine which books essays poetry plays film scripts etc will appear in the mass media Similarly Pamela Creedon argues that in the mid70s there is an increase of women in the maledominated profession of journalism

In The Status of Women in the US Media 2014 The Womens Media Centre researchers explore the current status of women in the mass media industry The report compiles 27000 pieces of content among 20 of the most widely circulated read and viewed and listened TV networks newspapers news wires and online news in the United States The results show that women 361 are significantly outnumbered by men 634 Although the number of women on TV news broadcasts is generally growing the misrepresentation of women does not only regard their presence as anchors but also the events that they cover Several studies show that while men mainly report on hard news women are often relegated to cover soft news Thus women are often muted in terms of the topics they tend to cover

Although the Womens Media Centre study is very UScentric nondominant groups are often muted even in other countrys media landscapes For example Aparna Hebbani and ChariseRose Wills have explored how Muslim women have often been muted in the Australian mass media sphere Their study shows that women that wear a hijab or burqa are often inaccurately and negatively connoted in Australian mass media According to the authors Muslim women represent a muted group and thus cannot entirely incorporate their experiences views and perspective in their representation in Australian media Thus there is a social hierarchy that is privileging certain groups via Australian mass media It also shows that although currently muted this group is attempting to gain a voice in this media landscape by engaging and interacting with members of the dominant culture in order to negotiate their silenced position

There are some conventional stereotypes attached to men and women in society when an individuals behavior deviates from this norm they attain negative feedback for this opposition to the norm by their actions In the case of women this gets quite complicated as women are told to act in a certain manner but when they do try and emulate their male counterparts they are discriminated and discouraged for acting that way

Social rituals are another example of a place in which the muting process takes place Kramarae suggests that many elements within wedding ceremonies place women in a silenced position For example the fact that the father of the bride gives her away to the groom that the position of the bride  at the left of the minister  is considered less privileged than the one of the groom that the groom announces his vows first and that the groom is asked to kiss the bride are all factors that contribute to the position of a woman as subordinated to the one of the man

As Catharine MacKinnon one of the leading voices in the feminist legal movement  suggests the law sees women similarly as men see women Like language the legal system has thus been created defined and interpreted mostly by men In the context of unequal power relations between men and women MacKinnon proposes new standards to define and evaluate sexual harassment and sexrelated issues considered as the consequence of unwanted impositions of sexual requirements Finley argues that there has been a recent interest in feminist jurisprudence and legal scholarship inspired by the laws failure to see that despite the legal removal of barriers sexes are not socially equal

In 1940s America women entered the workplace in great numbers while men were at war However after the war period the society did not encourage the participation of women in the workplace and in this way tried to assert male dominance in the society Organizations still appear to be male dominated Womens experiences are often not taken into account in the workplace the way male experiences are The structure is maintained by men who primarily use communication from the male perspective

Most organization goals are met by the usage of malepreferential language as they tend to focus on aspects such as economic gain and performance improved The main point of organizational communication is that it can help an employee fulfill their work duties Women are not able to fulfill these duties using language more relevant to them so in order to attain success in their workplace they have to go beyond their natural realm and utilize malepreferential language

One of the ways that women are differentiated can be observed when we take the performance appraisals into consideration What they mainly consist of is reviews that are based on the standards that are more like masculine standards Research points to muted groups having little to no sense of agency dominant emotions and can point to the employees role in the silencing

One member of the subordinate group that is also silenced in the workplace are women who face sexual harassment by the dominant group Many women have a hard time when faced with harassment in a male dominated workplace because they are the verbal minority Organizations rarely encourage issues of sexual harassment be discussed openly and call for confidentiality when dealing with complaints Furthermore women rarely go through formal channels of reporting sexual harassment for a number of reasons to include expecting their compliant to be ignored or trivialized by the male dominant group fear of not being protected from retaliation worry that the male dominated hierarchy will team up against them or that their time will be wasted due to the organizations ineffective sexual harassment policy Those from the subordinate groups are trusted less than white men in the workplace and in general

The classroom can be a place where women are muted Womens education in the United States has progressed over the years but academia is still maledominated Kramarae has raised several suggestions for more inclusive educational environments such as including womens humor speechlessness and ways to address the issue of abusive language Including more diverse language systems in academia can keep it from being dominated by one way of thinking

In the classroom men and women utilize language differently The bond differently with other members of their gender Women tend to bond with each other through the process of discussing their problems while men bond with each other using playful insults and put downs In the event of classroom discussions men tend to believe that they are supposed to dominate the class discussion while women avoid dominating the discussions

Houston believes in order to create a positive reform in education it might be useful to revise the curriculum and lay special stress on womancentered communication education Womens Studies WS has evolved and grown over the years Today there is greater demand for faculty to be on initiatives such as WS programs African American Programs and other programs focused on marginalized groups

Independent parties have emerged since World War II to offer people alternative choices for election However most of these parties operate only in circumscribed regions or with very narrow platforms Prentice studied the impact of the third party ie candidates from nonmajor parties in public debate He finds out that there have been few studies around third party by 2003 and even though third party candidates are involved in public campaign debates they remain inarticulate and ignored due to the judgment by standard of the political rhetoric and worldview of the major parties

Prentice points out that major parties usually interfere with the free expression of third parties through three ways ignoring their claims appearing confused verbally or nonverbally by the claims or actively attacking the claims made He also notices that the debate questions are structured in a way that reflects major parties worldviews which results in third partys mutedness In order to participate and articulate their own worldview third party candidates have to transform their ideas to match the major parties models through emphasizing the agreements with the majority rather than the differences and sometimes may lead them to make statements that can be misinterpreted

LGBT groups are considered marginalized and muted in our society The dominant groups who hold privileged positions within society have developed social norms that marginalize LGBT groups Although LGBT individuals do not necessarily share the same identity they share similar experiences of being marginalized by the dominant groups As Gross notes For many oppressed groups the experience of commonality is largely the commonality of their difference from and oppression by the dominant culture In order to function and achieve success within the dominant culture LGBT groups must adopt certain communication strategies to match the social norms

Gloria LadsonBillings believes that stories provide the necessary context for understanding feeling and interpreting and argues that voices of dispossessed and marginalized groups such as people of color are muted within the dominant culture Critical race theorists try to bring the marginalized groups viewpoint to the forefront through an encouragement of naming ones own reality Delgado addresses three reasons for naming ones own reality in legal discourse 1 much of reality is socially constructed 2 stories provide members of outgroups a vehicle for psychic selfpreservation and 3 the exchange of stories from teller to listener can help overcome ethnocentrism and the dysconscious drive or need to view the world in one way

When it comes to education critical race theorists argue that the official school curriculum is designed to maintain a White supremacist master script As Swartz contends master scripting sets the standard knowledge for students which legitimizes dominant white upperclass male voices and mutes multiple perspectives The voices from other nondominant groups are under control mastered and can only be heard through reshaping and translation to meet the dominant standard Therefore LasdonBilling argues that the curriculum should be raceneutral or colorblind present people of color and presume a homogenized we in a celebration of diversity

Ageism leads to certain age groups being muted in American society In particular the elderly are often ignored and marginalized

In Muted lives Older battered women Carol Seaver discusses how older abused women are silenced because of sexism and ageism She focuses on issues specific to elderly abused women not just abused women in general She argues that this group of domestic abuse survivors faces a specific set of difficulties They are silenced by ageist assumptions about them as too resistant and hopeless to change or made invisible by the notion that very frail elders are the only victims of elder abuse Here age intersects with gender to create a specific kind of muted group In Muted groups in health communication policy and practice The case of older adults in rural and frontier areas Deborah BallardReisch examines how and why elderly populations in the rural areas of Nevada and Kansas are considered muted health communication groups Ageism as well as other factors result in this community being muted

Aging populations as seen in Seaver and BallardReischs works can be silenced by stereotypes such as the idea that the elderly are resistant to change

Issues of ageism intersect with heterosexism when looking at how aging LGBT community members are silenced Scholar Maria T Brown writes The exclusion of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT elders from queer and gerontological theories has resulted in the silencing of LGBT older adults and their experiences Brown claims that the silencing is a rhetorical move that excludes the elderly from queer theory and queerness from the field gerontology This case study is an example of how identities intersect in this case being elderly and part of the LGBT community MGT can apply to both of these identities and intersections

Marcel Calvez argues that What makes a social group muted is that claims of its members to participate into social life are discounted and that they have internalised the idea that they are not entitled to raise their voice By this logic he says that those with intellectual disabilities are muted Calvezs study examines the experiences of those with intellectual disabilities with special attention to the fact these groups are often marginalized and silenced

Many disabled groups are silenced by the dominant abled group that knowingly or unknowingly exclude them The means of muting ridicule ritual control and harassment can all apply to disabled groups Ableist language such as use of the pejorative term retard can be used to ridicule disabled groups By bringing attention to the use of pejoratives and how they affect certain communities disabled individuals and abled allies can raise awareness about their harm

To get their concerns recognized by the dominant group the subordinate groups take on language and communication styles of the dominant group There are particularly stringent demands on the performances by members of inferior groups when they communicate with persons from the dominant group Orbe 1994 identified six themes central to African American male communication 1 the importance of other African Americans 2 learning how to communicate with nonAfrican Americans 3 keeping a safe distance 4 playing the part snap 5 testing the sincerity of nonAfrican Americans and 6 an intense social responsibility Respondents in Orbes research were observed changing immediately into two different people in order to play the part when communicating with nonAfrican Americans 

In addition to African American men feeling as though they need to communicate differently with White men African American women also feel pressure to conform to the dominant language A speakers dialect eg Black English or Mainstream American English is most heavily influenced by his or her place in the social hierarchy for example the speakers socioeconomic status educational status provenance andor racialethnic origin As a result African American women find themselves needing to codeswitch when communicating with the dominant group

MGT offers ways to change the muting status quo ie naming the strategies of silencing reclaiming elevating and celebrating womens discourse and creating new languages based on the experience of the marginalized group

Women as a muted group recognize the ways in which women are silenced both interpersonally and societally but also stress the ways that they resist being silenced such as labeling and talking about problems that are usually ignored in the dominant discourse Vonnegut 1992 Specifically with the creation of the Feminist Theory to understand the nature of gender inequality Additionally in the last year the international movement against sexual harassment and assault with the Me Too Movement are other examples of strategies of resistance against the dominant group

Although the muted group theory has been mainly developed as a feminist theory it can also be applied to other silenced groups in society Mark Orbe a communication theorist has suggested that in the US the dominant group consists of white heterosexual middleclass males Thus groups that distinguish themselves from the dominant one in terms of race age gender sexual orientation and economic status can potentially be silenced or muted

In AfricanAmerican communication research Toward a deeper understanding of interethnic communication 1995 and Constructing cocultural theory An explication of culture power and communication 1998 Orbe fleshed out two important extensions of muted group theory

Therefore although Kramarae focuses on womens muted voices she also opens the door to the application of muted group theory to issues beyond gender differences Orbe not only applies this theoretical framework to a different muted group ie AfricanAmericans but also contributes by assessing how individual and small collectives work together to negotiate their muted group status

Orbe regards interactions among underrepresented and dominant group members as cocultural communication He argues that there are three preferred outcomes in the cocultural communication process assimilation eg becoming integrated into mainstream culture accommodation gaining acceptance and space in a society and achieving cultural pluralism without hierarchy or separation maintaining a culturally distinct identity in intercultural interactions He also notes three communication approaches nonassertive when individuals are constrained and nonconfrontational putting the needs of others first to avoid conflicts assertive when individuals express feelings ideas and rights in ways that consider the needs of themselves and others or aggressive when individuals express feelings ideas and rights in ways that ignore the needs of others The different combinations of the three preferred outcomes and three communication approaches result in nine communication orientations

Further although various groups can be considered as muted within society silenced and dominant groups can also exist within any group For example Anita Taylor and M J Hardman posit that feminist movements can also present dominant subgroups that mute other groups within the same movement Thus members within oppressed groups can have diverse opinions and one can become dominant and further mute the others

Edwin Ardener saw that MGT had pragmatic as well as analytical potentials Edwin Ardener always maintained that MGT was not only or even primarily about women  although women comprised a conspicuous case in point In fact he also drew on his personal experience as a sensitive intellectual boy among hearty sportive boys in an all boys London secondary school As a result of his early encounters with other boys he identified with other groups in society for whom selfexpression was constrained

MGT has often been challenged Deborah Tannen the theorist that created Genderlect Theory criticizes feminist scholars like Kramarae for assuming that men are trying to control women Tannen acknowledges that differences in male and female communication styles sometimes lead to imbalances of power but unlike Kramarae she is willing to assume that the problems are caused primarily by men and womens different styles Tannen warns readers that bad feelings and imputation of bad motives or bad character can come about when there was no intention to dominate to wield power Kramerae thinks Tannens opinion is nave She believes men belittle and ignore women whenever they speak out against being muted She also pointed out that our political educational religious legal and media systems support gender race and class hierarchies Both theorists believe muting is involved but they see it from different standpoints

There are many theories that appear to be related to Muted Group Theory These include but are not limited to

Caquetoire
The caquetoire or conversation chair was an armchair style which emerged during the European Renaissance 

It was largely used in France and is one of the most wellknown pieces of furniture from the French Renaissance This chair is often associated with groups of women sitting and conversing Due to fashions of the time and the lack of heating systems in homes women wore several layers of skirts and petticoats to keep warm This often prevented them from fitting comfortably into armchairs with rectangular seats A caquetoire seat is splayed so women in their large skirts could easily sit

These chairs were often made from walnut rather than oak allowing the frames to be more elaborately carved They were built with mortise and tenon joinery so no nails were exposed and no glue had to be used The supports were balusterturned and terminated in bun feet

The name caquetoire is derived from caqueter a French term meaning to chat The chair was thus named the caquetoire as a reference to women sitting and talking

Culture of Montreal
Montreal was referred to as Canadas Cultural Capital by Monocle Magazine The city is Canadas centre for Frenchlanguage television productions radio theatre film multimedia and print publishing The Quartier Latin is a neighbourhood crowded with cafs animated by this literary and musical activity Montreals many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture

As a North American city Montreal shares many of the cultural features characteristic of the other metropolis on the continent including representations in all traditional manifestation of high culture a longlasting tradition of jazz and rock music and tentative experimentation in visual arts theatre music and dance Yet being at the confluence of the French and the English traditions Montreal has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face in the world Another distinctive characteristic of Montreal culture life is to be found in the animation of its downtown particularly during summer prompted by cultural and social events or festivals

A cultural heart of classical art and the venue for many summer festivals the Place des Arts is a complex of different concert and theatre halls surrounding a large openspaced square in the downtown Culture lovers will find six concert and theatre halls five of them inside Salle WilfridPelletier Thtre Maisonneuve Thtre JeanDuceppe Cinquime Salle StudioThtre and one outside site lEsplanade Classical dances operas plays and music performance from troops around the world and from Montreals very own are scheduled in these halls on a daily basis The Muse dart contemporain is located across the Esplanade from Place des Arts and some of the most important theatre troupes and musical concert scenes are found nearby in what is now called the Quartier des Spectacles

Performing at Place des Arts is the citys chief ballet company Les Grands Ballets Canadiens In contemporary dance Montreal has been a leader particularly since the 1980s Internationally recognized avantgarde dance troupes such as La La La Human Steps O Vertigo and the Fondation JeanPierre Perreault have toured the world and worked with international popular artists during videos and concerts The intelligent and seamless integration of multidisciplinary arts into the choreography of these troupes helped pave the way for the popularity of the Cirque du Soleil a multimilliondollar empire based on a mixture of modern circus and performing acts The agora de la danse is a studio where contemporary dancers most often perform

The Place des Arts also harbors the headquarters of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra MSO that perform in its halls regularly The MSO is one of the top performance troupes in North America most remembered for the quality performance of the repertoire of Maurice Ravel Since 2006 the MSO has a new conductor the American Kent Nagano 
Two other popular Montreal orchestras that perform regularly at Places des Arts are the Orchestre Mtropolitain conducted by Yannick NzetSguin and I Musici de Montral a chamber orchestra founded by Yuli Turovsky and since 2011 conducted by JeanMarie Zeitouni I Musici de Montral are considered among the greatest interpreters of the works of George Frideric Handel Place des Arts is also the home of the Opra de Montral the most prestigious opera company in Montreal One Montreal radio station is entirely devoted to classical music

Given that Montreal is mostly Frenchspeaking most popular local bands and singers have sung in French In the past the most popular local artists succeeded in filling arenas Beau Dommage Offenbach Cowboys Fringants or even the Olympic Stadium eg Diane Dufresne a feat usually reserved to a few international rock stars Special events such as the musical show on the Quebec national holiday regularly attract over one hundred thousand people The height for the French musical scene is reached every year during the Francofolies The festival attracts international artists from La Francophonie popular artists from the Quebec musical scene and emerging artists noticed during preceding festivals

Montreals Englishspeaking music scene also succeeds in getting attention from popular media around the world The growing success of the current variety of artists and bands with Arcade Fire arguably leading the way owes much to the citys culture of melting together different genres of music present from many different cultures A variety of music festivals and independent local record labels also helps sustain this success Other Montreal bands include Wolf Parade Mobile the Unicorns and Simple Plan

The Montreal International Jazz Festival illustrates well this melting of genres Far from limiting itself to classical jazz a style that Montreal always represented with jazzmen such as Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones it features a great variety of artists who have espoused rhythms and styles from around the world Smaller musical festivals include Festival International Nuits Afrique African Nights Montreal Reggae Festival Pop Montreal FestiBlues international de Montral Mutek electronic music festival and Osheaga rock festival

Every Sunday in Parc MontRoyal neardowntown Montreal there is a huge impromptu drumming festival in which hundreds of drummers are invited to jam Tam Tams

Theatre in Montreal is dominated by Frenchlanguage productions in part because Montreal has traditionally been a centre for most successful Quebec plays As a result the most celebrated and internationally recognized Quebec playwrights have all worked in Montreal at some point including Michel Tremblay Les Belles Soeurs Hosanna who revolutionized Quebec theatre by writing in the local dialect joual and Montrealadoptee Wajdi Mouawad Wedding Day at the Cromagnons Scorched Most established Frenchlanguage theatres are found in the Quartier Latin eg Thtre du Rideau Vert or near Place des Arts Thtre du Nouveau Monde Thtre JeanDuceppe The city also hosts the Festival TransAmriques a twoweek showcase of international experimental theatre

In contrast English theatre struggled but survived with the Centaur Theatre In 1979 David Fennario achieved notable success and notoriety with Canadas first bilingual play Balconville which documents rivalries between the English and French working class in the suburb of PointeStCharles Ethnic theatre by the 70s began to be a force notably with the Black Theatre Workshop under the leadership of artistic director Tyrone Benskin the Yiddish Theatre established at the Saidye Bronfman Centre and later with the Teesri Duniya and Dummies Theatre In late 1990s Montreal started to become a hotspot for lowbudget independent English theatre with companies such as Optative Theatrical Laboratories Infinithtre MainLine Theatre Gravy Bath Theatre Sa Booge Persephone Pumpkin Productions and Tableau DHte Theatre adding to the scene More recently theatre has been taking a more activist turn with emerging organizations such as ATSA and the Optative Theatrical Laboratories and festivals such as the Anarchist Theatre Festival MAYWORKS and the Infringement Festival

Montral has a rich yet still relatively young literary history in both French and English literature A large number of novels have captured the realities of Montreal While any list will understandably be subjective a few works are agreed to be important in Canadian and Qubcois literature Written in 1947 Gabrielle Roys The Tin Flute in French Bonheur doccasion which chronicles the life of a young woman in the neighborhood of StHenri marked Qubcois literature for its urban texture The work of Mordecai Richler highlighted by The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz 1959 depicts the lives of poor Englishspeaking residents of Mile End Mostly Michel Tremblay perhaps best summarizes the alienation of poor workingclass Montralais at the onset of the Quebec Quiet revolution The alltime bestselling novel in Qubcois literature Yves Beauchemins The Alley Cat Le Matou depicts a relatively similar neighborhood twenty years later The later work of mile Ollivier for example La Brlerie is a portrait of Frenchspeaking immigrants establishing their lives in the CtedesNeiges neighborhood
The nineteenthcentury poet mile Nelligan whom American critic Edmund Wilson famously called the only firstrate Canadian poet French or English has many schools and libraries named in his honour in Montreal and around Quebec 
Montreal was also the centre of literary modernism in English Canada led by the Montreal Group of poets including AM Klein and F R Scott in the mid1920s 
Montreal hosts a number of events related to literature including the multilingual Blue Metropolis Montreal International Literary Festival which takes place every Spring and the Expozine alternative press fair every fall

There are plenty of Englishlanguage screens in the city mostly downtown The largest and most modern are the central Paramount Montreal and the AMC Forum both located on SteCatherine Street In addition to presenting movies from the majors the AMC Forum also presents independent movies of repertory cinema Other cinemas concentrating on repertory movies include the Cinma du Parc

Cineastes have on occasion chosen Montreal for their movies See Montreal in films

Montreal has a vast network of museums art galleries and exhibition centres The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts possess a varied collection of European First Nations Inuit and Canadian arts including important paintings from Montreals own Betty Goodwin James Wilson Morrice and Paulmile Borduas The Muse dart contemporain has concentrated its collection mainly to emerging postwar Quebec artists with arguably some of the best artistic works in Quebec from Alfred Pellan and JeanPaul Riopelle

Other praised museums are the Redpath Museum the Stewart Museum the McCord Museum of Canadian History the Canadian Centre for Architecture and the Montreal Museum of Archeology and History

The region is also home to a number of sciencerelated museums Many of them are located in the Olympic Park complex including the Montreal Biodome which reproduces four ecosystems of The Americas the Montreal Insectarium the Montreal Botanical Garden and the Montreal Planetarium On the West Island the Ecomuseum draws many visitors and features an outdoor setting complete with animals native to the area A recent addition to Montreals museum scene is the Montreal Science Centre located in the Old Port and featuring many handson experiments in various fields of science The Laval Cosmodome houses both Space Camp Canada and the Space Science Centre A short drive south in Granby is the Granby Zoo notable for its wide variety of animals and amusements

Montreal is the cultural centre of Qubec Frenchspeaking Canada and Frenchspeaking North America as a whole and an important city in the Francophonie It is the largest Frenchspeaking city in North America and the cultural capital of the Quebec province The city is a hub for Frenchlanguage television productions radio theatre circuses performing arts film multimedia and print publishing The best talents from French Canada and even the Frenchspeaking areas of the United States converge in Montreal and often perceive the city as their cultural capital Montreal is also the most important stop in the Americas for Francophone artists from Europe Africa and Asia

Some 30 years after the adoption of the Charter of the French Language a greater number of first or secondgeneration immigrants have established themselves in Montreal such as playwright Wajdi Mouawad Lebanese origin singer Nicolas Ciccone Italian origin and author Dany Laferrire Haitian origin who all contribute to Quebecs culture

Montreal is also the cultural capital for English Quebec The Montreal Gazette newspaper McGill University and the Centaur Theatre are traditional hubs of Anglo culture The cultural divide between Montreals and Canadas Francophone and Anglophone culture was strong and was famously referred to as the Two Solitudes by Canadian writer Hugh MacLennan Reflecting their deepseated colonial roots the Solitudes were historically strongly entrenched in Montreal splitting the city geographically at Saint Laurent Boulevard This split however has become less and less apparent in the past decades Although Anglophones still concentrate in the Montreal boroughs on the west side of the island they have become more bilingual as 66 of Quebec Anglophones claim to be able to carry on a conversation in French Thus while tensions can occur between Anglophones and Francophones contemporary Montreal is home to a diverse collection of cultures and people who generally live together amicably

Other cultural communities be it firstgeneration immigrants or longtime settlers in Montreal have greatly contributed to the originality and flavor of Montreal Many festivals and parades are organized to celebrate the contribution of these communities such as the Irish Saint Patrick Parade the Greek Independence Day Parade or the Festival des Nuits dAfrique Montreals Jewish community has been a leading contributor to Montreals cultural landscape and is renowned for its level of charitable giving and its plethora of cultural and social service community institutions Among these are the worldrenowned Jewish Public Library of Montreal Segal Centre for the Arts Museum of Jewish Montreal and Montreal Holocaust Memorial Centre

Nicknamed  the city of a hundred belltowers Montreal is renowned for its churches Indeed as Mark Twain once noted This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldnt throw a brick without breaking a church window The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas Mary Queen of the World Cathedral the aforementioned NotreDame Basilica St Patricks Basilica and Saint Josephs Oratory
The Oratory is the largest church in Canada with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peters Basilica in Rome

Other wellknown churches include NotreDamedeBonSecours Chapel which is sometimes called the Sailors Church and the Anglican Christ Church Cathedral which was completely excavated and suspended above an excavated pit during the construction of part of the Underground City All of the above are major tourist destinations particularly NotreDame and the Oratory

The dominant religion in Quebec is Christianity which is adhered to by roughly 902 of the population

Montreal is the seat of a diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church

Of note is the regional variation the Montreal hot dog But Montreals culinary landscape is perhaps most influenced by the diverse fabric of its ethnic communities Italian Greek Jewish and Lebanese communities have contributed to the mix of Montreals restaurants Jewish contributions include two worldrenowned items Montreal smoked meat sandwiches and Montreal style bagels Lebanese falafels and shish taouk sandwiches and Japanese sushi have become muchappreciated cuisines

This wide variety of cuisines underlines the fact that Montreal is one of the cities in the world with the highest number of restaurants Montreal and its culinary landscape was the focus of Gourmet magazines March 2006 issue Montreals unique cuisine has also given birth to a number of Montrealcentric restaurants and restaurant chains such as Dagwoods Dic Anns Hamburgers Dunns Famous Moishes Steakhouse and Lafleur Restaurants

Tourism is an important industry in Montreal The city welcomed 14 million visitors in 2005 Like the province of Quebec visitors to Montreal come from around the world most of them from the United States France the United Kingdom Germany Mexico and Japan 39000 jobs in Montreal were generated by the tourism industry in 2005

Crescent Street in Downtown Montreal is popular among tourists Throughout the summer it features various street fairs and festivals Among locals Crescent Street is known better for its many clubs and bars SaintLaurent Boulevard and the surrounding Plateau MontRoyal neighbourhood are also well known for their restaurants bars nightlife and nightclubs

Montreal is also famous as the birthplace of the Infringement Festival a reaction to the perceived corporatization of the Montreal Fringe Festival The Infringement has since spread to many other cities in North America and Europe

During the period of Prohibition in the United States Montreal became well known as one of North Americas sin cities with unparalleled nightlife a reputation it still holds today In part its bustling nightlife is attributed to its relatively late last call 3 am a large university population the drinking age of 18 and the excellent public transportation system combines with other aspects of the Montreal culture to make the citys night life unique The diversity of the clubs in Montreal attests to the popularity of its night life with night clubs pubs bars and singing bars bote  chanson Latin clubs African clubs jazz clubs lounges afterhours houses and strip clubs all attracting different types of customers

The most active parts during Montreal night life are the Downtown and the Quartier Latin SaintDenis street which goes across the Quartier Latin attracts a majority of the Frenchspeaking population SaintLaurent Street known locally as the Main is also one of the most popular streets A majority of Englishspeaking Montrealers frequent the western part of the Downtown with Crescent Street being one of the most popular streets in this sector These three streets are all crossed by Downtowns most commercial street SainteCatherine Street which extends to its East in the heart of Montreal gay night life

Harry Barnes Liberal politician
Major Harry Barnes 5 December 1870  12 October 1935 was a radical United Kingdom Liberal Party politician architect and author specialising in housing and town planning

He first stood for parliament in 1918 when he was selected as the Liberal candidate for Newcastle upon Tyne East He had served as a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers Voluntary Regiment He had been the District Valuer for Newcastle upon Tyne from 19161918 so knew the town well The seat was a newly created constituency and his prospects of winning were helped when no Unionist opponent came forward and he was endorsed by the Coalition Government led by David Lloyd George 

Despite being elected as a supporter of the government Barnes resigned the Coalition Liberal Whip in November 1919 to take the opposition Liberal Whip In parliament Barnes was associated with the more radical wing of the Liberals due to his support for a number of social reforms In particular he favoured the introduction of a Capital levy which in 1919 put him at odds with the caretaker Liberal Leader Sir Donald Maclean Radical Liberals had proposed a Commons motion to introduce a capital levy which MacLean had failed to support Barnes publicly criticised MacLean at that years National Liberal Federation conference

He was strong supporter of Free Trade and served as Honorary secretary of the Cobden Club from 19201924 At the 1922 election he sought reelection again as the official Liberal candidate Although he did not have a Unionist opponent he found he was also opposed by a National Liberal supporter of the recently deposed Prime Minister Lloyd George This had the effect of splitting the Liberal vote with unfortunate consequences

In December 1922 his successful Labour opponent died causing a byelection He was again selected as the Liberal candidate By then relations between Lloyd George and Asquith were improving and he faced no National Liberal candidate However a Unionist candidate intervened in the byelection with the same effect

He decided to try his luck elsewhere and stood in Tynemouth at the 1923 general election Tynemouth had been a Unionist seat since they gained it from the Liberals in 1918 He did well but not quite well enough 

He contested Tynemouth again at the 1924 election but in a difficult year for the Liberal Party his return to parliament was again thwarted

He was also involved in local government politics in London He served as an Alderman on the London County Council from 19231925 for the Liberal backed Progressive Party

In September 1927 Barnes was selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for the Unionist seat of Warwick and Leamington However he was not called upon to contest the seat at an election In 1928 Barnes instead contested a July byelection in the West Yorkshire seat of Halifax following the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons John Henry Whitley who had represented the seat as Liberal since 1900 This seemed to represent his best chance of returning to parliament but he was to be disappointed

He did not stand for Parliament again

At the 1934 LCC Elections he stood as a Labour candidate at Fulham East and was elected He served as Chairman of the LCCs Town Planning Committee However he served on the LCC for little more than a year before his death

He had published a number of publications on social matters

Count Your Blessings Bring Me the Horizon album
Count Your Blessings is the debut studio album by the English rock band Bring Me the Horizon Recorded at DEP International Studios in Birmingham with producer Dan Sprigg it was originally released in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006 by Visible Noise The album was later issued by Earache Records in the United States on 14 August 2007 Count Your Blessings was supported by the release of music videos for two of the albums tracks Pray for Plagues on 4 June 2007 and For Stevie Wonders Eyes Only Braille on 6 March 2008

Named after a lyric in the albums opening song Pray for Plagues Count Your Blessings is representative of the bands early deathcore sound which was phased out on later releases and eventually abandoned in favour of other less aggressive styles The band members were young when they recorded the album and both the band and its fans have largely disregarded it later in their career as inferior to their later material it began as early as 2008 when guitarist Lee Malia was already criticising the albums quality Most of the songs on the record quickly faded from the bands live setlists Most band members recorded their parts individually rather than the group doing so as a whole with the central location of the studio blamed for distracting the young musicians The album received some negative reviews with the main complaints revolving around musical originality although it still reached number 93 of the UK Albums Chart

Following the release of their first extended play This Is What the Edge of Your Seat Was Made For in October 2004 Bring Me the Horizon toured extensively while writing new material for their fulllength debut album Due to the number of shows the band were playing at the time much of the material was written quickly before recording was due to begin  drummer Matt Nicholls claimed that three songs were written in the space of two days due to the upcoming deadline A number of songs are rerecordings of early demos that the band had taped for a project titled The Bedroom Sessions and in a broadcast session for the UK station Radio 1 namely I Used to Make Out With Medusa Off the Heezay and Liquor  Love Lost then known as Dragon Slaying

Recording took place at DEP International Studios in Birmingham with producer Dan Sprigg who had previously worked with bands including Cradle of Filth Napalm Death and more recently Lostprophets Frontman Oliver Sykes described the recording process as an intense experience due to the groups desire to make the best debut album they could with biographer Ben Welch claiming that they were starting to feel the pressure of all of the hype that was building around them at the time Due to the studios location in the centre of the city the young band members all under 20 years old at the time were often distracted and would not spend a lot of time in the studio this meant that each individual member ended up recording the majority of their contributions to the album alone rather than the full unit performing together

When recording Count Your Blessings Bring Me the Horizon intended to make an album which sounded as heavy and brutal as they possibly could Welch claims that the band scrapped any song ideas that didnt fit that criterion Speaking in 2014 about the bands intentions when writing and recording music during their early years Sykes claimed the group just wanted to make noisy music Similarly when asked about the bands beginnings in a 2014 interview guitarist Lee Malia explained When youre young you just want to do everything to extremes Thats what the first EP and the album were like too overexcited sounding Matt Nicholls said that on Count Your Blessings Bring Me the Horizon were influenced a lot by Swedish metal  At The Gates and stuff like that Nicholls also said that on Count Your Blessings Bring Me the Horizons members were 18 or 19 years old and wanted to be as metal as possible Specifically the bands members were influenced by Norma Jean Skycamefalling Metallica Pantera At the Gates Arch Enemy The Dillinger Escape Plan and In Flames at the bands beginning

The musical style of Count Your Blessings is most often categorised as deathcore but has also been labeled more generally as metalcore In addition to metalcore Count Your Blessings uses elements of genres like melodic death metal death metal and black metal drawing comparisons to bands like The Black Dahlia Murder Cannibal Corpse and At the Gates Last Rites compared the albums vocals which consist of death growls and highpitched shrieks to black metal and the albums guitar playing to Gothenburg melodic death metal According to Drowned in Sound columnist Raziq Rauf the songs on the album generally consist of The Black Dahlia Murderstyle thunderous riffs mixed with some dastardly sludgy doom moments and more breakdowns than your dads old Nissan Sunny The lyrical content is admittedly simple which according to Sykes is due to the fact that his life had never been that bad at the time he wrote them the singer has noted that most songs on the album are about girls or just growing up which he claims contributes to the groups brand of party music

Count Your Blessings was originally released in the United Kingdom on 30 October 2006 by Visible Noise It was not released in the United States until 14 August 2007 when it was issued by Earache Records The version released by retailer Hot Topic featured a cover version of Slipknots Eyeless as a bonus track which had originally been recorded for Higher Voltage Another Brief History of Rock a CD released for free with an issue of Kerrang magazine in June 2007 A first music video for Pray for Plagues was directed by Kenny Lindstrm and released on 4 June 2007 A second music video directed by Perrone Salvatore For Stevie Wonders Eyes Only Braille was issued on 6 March 2008

Following the release of Count Your Blessings Bring Me the Horizon toured extensively in support of the album Throughout October and November the group toured the UK with American black metal band Abigail Williams although the Phoenix Arizonabased band left the tour early on after drummer Zach Gibson suffered a wrist injury Centurion replaced Abigail Williams for the remainder of the tour and Bring Me the Horizon spent the rest of the year supporting labelmates Lostprophets The band later replaced Bury Your Dead supporting Killswitch Engage on their European tour in January 2007 then continued to tour the UK through March and April During the summer the band played a number of festivals including Download Festival

Upon its release Count Your Blessings debuted at number 93 on the UK Albums Chart It also reached number 9 on the UK Rock  Metal Albums Chart It remained in the UK Rock top 40 for a further two weeks first dropping to number 14 and then to number 26

Most of the media response to Count Your Blessings was mixed to negative AllMusics Stewart Mason praised the album for being vaguely interesting musically claiming that there is a greater sense of dynamic than usual in the genre on the release Chad Bowar for Aboutcom highlighted the band within their scene praising their catchy melodies and decent riffs and solos and on Count Your Blessings welcomed the variety in styles of vocal delivery across the collection Exclaim writer Bill Whish wrote positively about the release praising the vitriolic lyrics and brutally heavy guitar work and welcoming the band as a little more interesting than some other metalcore artists DIY magazines Tom Connick dubbed I Used to Make Out With Medusa the crowning jewel of Count Your Blessings in a 2014 feature claiming that it Perfectly captures that youthful drunken recklessness that defined the bands most controversial years with its razor sharp guitar work and thunderous breakdowns

However many commentators criticised the lack of invention on the album Mason panned it for featuring generally unimaginative songwriting which he claimed added little to the existing knowledge base of the genre He also criticised Sykess vocal style on the record which he described as an immediately irritating and a highpitched gibber Similarly Bowar dubbed the album way too generic and repetitive claiming that it features too many breakdowns and a majority of extremely forgettable songs Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks complained that the band displayed nothing to distinguish them from the pack on the album although he did praise the presence of some decent breakdowns and claim that the songs would make good background noise

Due to the young age of the band when they recorded the album and the drastic stylistic changes which followed its release Count Your Blessings has largely been neglected in recent years both by the band and by their fans As early as 2008 guitarist Lee Malia was criticising the albums quality and noting that the band quickly wanted to do something better after its release Following the release of Drown in 2014 described by Digital Spys Adam Silverstein as a universe away from the  fullon commotion of Count Your Blessings Sykes reflected that the single would have offended the band members when they were younger adding that the group were never gonna sound like that again

Keyboardist Jordan Fish who joined Bring Me the Horizon about 6 years after the albums release has explained the drastic evolution in style between Count Your Blessings and later releases as simply being due to the fact that the band members dont listen to deathcore anymore claiming that to attempt that type of music would be dishonest due to the members change in tastes and feelings Alternative Press writer Tyler Sharp has added that The members of Bring Me the Horizon have evolved from teenage metalheads to a group of mature progressed songwriters in response to criticism of their change in style Most of the albums songs were dropped from live performances in the years following the release of Suicide Season and There Is a Hell although Pray for Plagues returned to set lists briefly in late 2014 when the band performed with original guitarist Curtis Ward at a few shows The song is featured on the video album Live at Wembley recorded in December 2014

Despite the radical evolution of the band since Count Your Blessings the album has still received some retrospective praise In a feature published in 2015 Kerrang writer Emily Carter credited the album for increasing the popularity of the band during their formative years as well as praising its guitar riffs and the song Pray for Plagues AXS contributor Rey Harris described the album as a classic among deathcore fans highlighting Black  Blue in particular Sarai C of Loudwire named Pray for Plagues the fourth best Bring Me the Horizon song to date as of May 2014 praising it as one of Bring Me the Horizons most timeless tracks Dan Slessor for Alternative Press included Tell Slater Not to Wash His Dick as the alternative tenth choice in his feature of The 10 best Bring Me the Horizon songs praising its exuberant energy and rich melody

Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur
Ali Akbar Mohtashamipour or Mohtashami  born 1947 is a Shia cleric who was active in the 1979 Iranian Revolution and later became interior minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran He is seen as a founder of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon and one of the radical  elements advocating the export of the revolution in the Iranian clerical hierarchy

In an assassination attempt targeting Mohtashami he lost his right hand when he was opening a book loaded with explosives

Mohtashemi studied in the holy city of Najaf Iraq where he spent considerable time with his mentor the Ayatollah Khomeini He also accompanied Khomeini in the exile period in both Iraq and France He cofounded an armed group in the 1970s with Mohammad Montazeri son of Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri in Lebanon and Syria aiming at assisting liberation movements in Muslim countries

Following the revolution he served as Irans ambassador to Syria from 1982 to 1986 He later became Irans minister of interior While ambassador to Syria he is thought to have played a pivotal role in the creation of the Lebanese radical Shia organization Hezbollah working within the framework of the Department for Islamic Liberation Movements run by the Iranian Pasdaran Mohtashami actively supervised Hezbollahs creation merging into it existing radical Shiite movements the Lebanese alDawa the Association of Muslim Students Al Amal al Islamiyya In 1986 his close supervision of Hezbollah was cut short when the Office of Islamic Liberation was reassigned to Irans ministry of foreign affairs He is also described as making liberal use of the diplomatic pouch as Ambassador bringing in crates of material from Iran
He was remained among radical hard line parties even when he choose as the minister in the government of Musavi

In 1989 the new Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani ousted Mohtashami from the Lebanon desk of the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs replacing him with Rafsanjanis brother Mahmud Hashemi This was seen as an indication of Irans downgrading of its support for Hezbollah and for a revolutionary foreign policy in general

In August 1991 he regained some of his influence when he became chairman of the defense committee of the Majlis parliament of Iran

More controversially Mohtashami is thought
to have played an active role with the Pasdaran and Syrian military intelligence in the supervision of Hezbollahs suicide bomb attacks against the American embassy in Beirut in April 1983 the American and French contingents of the MNF in October 1983 and the American embassy annex in September 1984

and to have been instrumental in the killing of Lt Col William R Higgins the American Chief of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organizations UNTSO observer group in Lebanon who was taken hostage on 17 February 1988 by Lebanese proIranian Shia radicals The killing of Higgins is said to have come from orders issued by Iranian radicals most notably Mohtashemi in an effort to prevent improvement in the USIranian relationship

While Mohtashami was a strong opponent of Western influence in the Muslim world and of the existence of the state of Israel he was also a supporter and advisor of reformist Iranian president Mohammad Khatami who was famous for championing of free expression and civil rights Mohtashemi was in the Western news again in 2000 not as a hardline radical but for refusing to appear in court in Iran after his proreform newspaper Bayan was banned

Behzad Nabavi and Ali Akbar Mohtashami were among those who prevented by the Guardian council from taking part in the elections of Majlis

In 1984 after the Beirut bombings Mohtashami received a parcel containing a book on Shia holy places when he was serving as Iranian ambassador to Damascus As he opened the package it detonated blowing off his hand and severely wounding him Mohtashami was medevaced to Europe and survived the blast to continue his work The identity of the perpetrators of the attack is unknown

Mir Chakar Rind
Mirjat  Chakar Khan Rind Mir Shakar Khan Rind Meer Chaakar Khan Rind or Chakar The Great ChakariAzam Mirjat Baloch Nation 14681565 Balochi     was a Baloch chieftain in the 16th century He aided Mughal Emperor Humayun in his reconquest of the Subcontinent He is considered a folk hero of the Baloch people and an important figure in the Baloch epic Hani and Sheh Mureed

Mirjat  Chakar Rind lived near Sibi and became the head of Rind tribe at the age of 18 after the death of his father Mir Shahak Khan Rind Mirjat Chakars fiefdom was shortlived because of a civil war between the Lashari and Rind tribes of Balochistan Mir Chakar Rind head of the Rind tribe went to war which resulted in thousands dead The war and the gallantry of the two tribe leaders continues to be a part of the Baloch peoples history After the Thirty Years War against the Lashari Tribe Mir Chakar Rind defeated the Lasharis
Mir Chakar was a very brave man who desired to make the Baloch nation powerful 
When Mir Chakar left Sibi his next stop was Sanghar Desert He ruled the Sanghar area for many years No one could defeat Mir Chakar and his army until Mir Doda Khan arrived with his army Although Mir Chakar had defeated Mir Doda once before Mir Doda was badly frozen A man named Jakhrani helped him by asking his own daughter to sleep with Mir Doda so his temperature would return to normal After that the girl was married to Mir Doda and he planned and attacked Chakar again 
Mir Doda Khan defeated Mir Chakar in the desert of Sanghar after which Mir Chakar and his army left Sanghar and moved to the Multan area where he shook hands with the Multan king On the other side Shehmureed had gone to Saudi Arabia After Sheh Mureed one of his best fighters was Mir Malagh Khan Rind

It is said that Mir Malagh Khans sword weighed  No one but Mir Malagh could handle it 
Mir Qaiser Khan Mir Sanjar Khan and Mir Mandar Khan were some of Mir Chakars best fighters 
Mir Chakar and the Multan king then planned to conquer Delhi in India The Multan king asked for Mir Chakars help and he gave him his best fighters The Lashkar was led by Mir Malagh Khan and Mir Qaiser Khan who went and they conquered Delhi 
After this the Delhi king purportedly said There was not a single nail uncovered of the Baloch Their head could reach the glaring sun They were united they were brave 
On the other side Mir Doda was gaining power His grandsons Mir Ghazi khan and Mir Ismail khan were his best fighters The Dera Ghazi Khan and Dera Ismail Khan district of Pakistan are named after these two 
The Multan king invited Mir Doda to dinner When Mir Doda came the Multan king said that from then on he would be his left hand 
Mir Chakar became angry and planned to attack Mir Doda In the battle Mir Doda was badly defeated and his people and army moved to Sindh and never came back

Near the desert of Sanghar he built 100 houses for his relatives to live in and he named the place Sowkar also written Sokar This place is still located near the Sanghar desert in Tehsil Taunsa Dera Ghazi Khan District
Mir Malagh Khan also lived there as he was the best fighter of Mir Chakar Malghani Balochs are the descendants of this great man Now Sokar is the hometown of Malghani Baloch Tribe

Mir Chakar then settled in Satghara and gained power and respect in the area Sher Shah Suri sent a message to Mir Chakar to unite with him and consolidate his gains Mir Chakar appreciated the offer but refused to help Sher Shah Suri Under the command of his son Mir Shahdad Khan his forces instead joined the Mughal army of Emperor Humayun in 1555 after a long exile in Persia Emperor Humayun came back recaptured Delhi and ousted the Suri dynasty in 1556 As a reward Emperor Humayun conferred a vast Jagir including horses and slaves to Mir Chakar He ruled this territory until he died in 1565 People who accompanied Mir Chakar to Satghara after leaving Balochistan constructed a tomb for his body Noori Naseer Khan of Kalat and Meer Chakar are both Baloch heroes

The name Chakar is written differently Briggs in his translation gives the  Mir Jakar Zand a lithographed edition of Lucknow from Firishta gives while the British Museum TarikhiSher Shahi in ED iv 389397 gives  Chakur Rind correctly Mansel Longworth Dames

FreeWRL is an opensource compliant VRMLX3D browser for Microsoft Windows Linux and Mac OS X

FreeWRL was originally developed by Tuomas Lukka in 1998 Also in 1998 Canarie funded a project titled Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment DIVE over CAnet II with three partners the universities of
Ottawa and Western Ontario and
CRC Canada FreeWRL was used by CRC in this project as it ran on their platform of choice Linux and supported VRML additions the EAI protocol that allowed control of a VRML scene from outside entities

At the end of the DIVE project CRC took the knowledge gained from it and combined this knowledge with other ongoing projects European Commission funded projects of Meccano MERCI and MICE  and created a form of conferencing by designing a distributed multicast enabled virtual world with positiondependent audio capabilities This project MVIP  and the follow on MVIPII  leveraged VRML and Multicast to enable interaction in shared worlds where participants were physically distant by removing both high bitrate applications video and time sinks clientserver interaction to best give the participants the feeling of being in a shared space

MVIP and MVIP source is available  and papers describing MVIP can be found on acmorg here and

Engineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes sometimes resembling origami Packaging involves extrusion thermoforming molding and other processing technologies Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication filling processing and shipment Packaging engineers use principles of structural analysis and thermal analysis in their evaluations

Some packaging engineers have backgrounds in other science engineering or design disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field

Formal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering packaging science packaging technology etc BE BS MS MTech and PhD programs are available Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science business and engineering classes before progressing into industryspecific topics such as shelf life stability corrugated box design cushioning engineering design labeling regulations project management food safety robotics RFID tags quality management package testing packaging machinery tamperevident methods recycling computeraided design etc

In 1842 the Department of Excise set up a laboratory to check tobacco for adulteration ie the addition of other substances to increase profits and evade duty The amount of tobacco being sold was much greater than that being imported It had one employee George Phillips who used a microscope and chemical tests most of which he had developed himself The work of the laboratory expanded to check for adulteration in pepper beer and coffee with further staff being employed under Phillips and a new laboratory in 1859 by which time Excise had joined the Inland Revenue In 1861 it dealt with 11000 samples The work also expanded to include foodstuffs and soap and in 1874 Phillips had 12 permanent staff The Inland Revenue Laboratory as it was now known was appointed a Referee Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 ie one whose findings were accepted in a court of law This greatly added to the number of samples being submitted 

In 1894 an official Government Laboratory was set up combining both the Inland Revenue Laboratory and a separate Customs Laboratory which had been set up in 1860 moving to purposebuilt premises in 1897 The head was Dr Edward Thorpe with the title of Principal Chemist who expanded its activities to include health problems caused by the match and leadglazing industries His report of 1907 states that 173606 analyses and examinations were made on behalf of the departments of Customs and Excise other departments and in connection with two acts the Food And Drugs Act and the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act 

In 1911 the Government Laboratory became an independent department of government the smallest one under the Treasury as the Department of the Government Chemist The Principal Dr James Dobbie was the first to be given the new title of Government Chemist The analysis of tobacco remained a substantial part of the work being greatly increased during World War I because of supplies to troops Demand increased with interwar legislation and the Laboratory had to do considerable original research to develop new and better methods of analysis The number of routine samples between 1920 and 1939 went from 199388 to 430314 It was also asked by government to look into methods associated with the carriage of dangerous goods atmospheric pollution and the possible dangers to health arising from the use of tetraethyllead in motor fuel World War II produced a peak demand of 560 354 samples
In 1959 the Government Laboratory ceased to be a separate department but instead was under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and in 1963 moved to new premises in Cornwall House Waterloo London as the Laboratory of the Government Chemist In 1989 it was changed into an Executive Agency under the Department of Trade and Industry This gave it the remit to seek outside work which it already did to a significant extent and earn income to fully cover costs while having more management autonomy It also moved to new premises in Teddington
As part of a general programme of privatization of public services by the government Michael Heseltine announced that Laboratory of the Government Chemist would become independent nonprofit distributing company limited by guarantee or could possibly be bought by a company or institution which could show that it would still remain sufficiently independent to fulfill its statutory duties However the undertakings required to meet these obligations indefinitely meant that 40 initial expressions of interest produced only three considered suitable to bid and no actual bids A consortium of Laboratory employees the Royal Society of Chemistry and 3i put together a bid in 1995 which was accepted taking the form of a management buyout and it became LGC Ltd in February 1996

Since privatisation LGC has changed ownership and significantly expanded its activities Valued at 3 million when privatized it was sold for 80 million in 2003 to LGV part of Legal  General who sold it in 2010 to Bridgepoint Capital for the sum of 257 million who in turn sold it in 2015 to KKR

Jack Preger
Jack Preger born 25 July 1930 in Manchester England is a British doctor who has been offering medical treatment as well as vocational training to the poor in the Indian city of Kolkata and in other parts of West Bengal since 1972 He established the relief agency Calcutta Rescue

Preger graduated from St Edmund Hall Oxford with a postgraduate degree in economics and political science He worked for a few years as a farmer in Wales before selling his farm and deciding to become a doctor instead In 1965 he was admitted into the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin at the age of 35

In 1972 when he had just finished his internship although his plans had been to dedicate his life to the poor in South or Central America and he had prepared himself by learning Spanish he answered a call over the radio for doctors to help the people of then newly independent Bangladesh He was soon in Dhaka where he worked under squalid conditions in refugee camps filled with Urduspeaking people who intended to return to Pakistan He learnt Urdu and later Bengali In 1975 he set up a 90bed clinic in Dhaka and two farms on the outskirts of the city

However his work in Dhaka came to an abrupt end when he discovered that Dutch nongovernment organisation Terre des Hommes was operating a childsmuggling racket and exposed it despite the Bangladesh government warning him not to He was deported to Bangkok in 1979

After being deported from Bangladesh he went to India the same year and worked in Kolkata for six months under Mother Teresas Missionaries of Charity However Preger criticized the inadequate conditions in Mother Teresas charities saying If one wants to give love understanding and care one uses sterile needles This is probably the richest order in the world Many of the dying there do not have to be dying in a strictly medical sense

Preger thought that he would be able to do more if he operated independently and started a clinic for the poor below the flyover connecting the Howrah Bridge He also requested a work permit which ultimately was not given

Today Calcutta Rescue operates three clinics two schools and two vocational centres It employs 150 locally hired staff 
Support Groups for the work of Preger have been formed in several other countries mostly spurred on by tourists returning home who had witnessed his selfless work  England Switzerland France Germany Norway The Netherlands Canada the US

In 1980 the Foreigners Registration Office FRO of the West Bengal government noted that Preger had accepted a donation from a missionary organisation based in the United States and demanded that he declare himself as a missionary worker in addition to being a doctor He resolved this only after explaining to New Delhi officials that he was not a missionary worker Calcutta Rescue is entirely secular and was permitted to stay in Kolkata without a visa In 1981 the FRO charged him with entering India without a missionary visa but he was released on bail The FRO dropped the charge in 1989 after intervention by the then high commissioner of New Zealand to India Sir Edmund Hillary

After Preger registered Calcutta Rescue as a charity in 1991 he started two more clinics in Kolkata and donations came in from eight European countries He also obtained a residents permit However the government refused to grant him the clearance needed to accept foreign donations Preger then sued the government in Kolkatas courts Eventually the courts struck down the governments rejection and Preger was allowed to accept 15 million rupees per month in donations

As of 1999 Preger has to apply for a reentry visa from the FRO before he leaves India for any reason Most of these applications have required legal intervention to succeed On 23 February that year the FRO suddenly asked Preger to leave India within seven days The Calcutta High Court intervened by ordering the government to speedily grant him a return visa

In 1993 Preger was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire for his continued perseverance and incredible selflessness

In 2017 Preger was named Philanthropist of the Year by The Asian Awards at a ceremony in London England on 5th May 2017

Speech codes theory
Speech codes theory refers to a framework for communication in a given speech community As an academic discipline it explores the manner in which groups communicate based on societal cultural gender occupational or other factors

A speech code can also be defined as a historically enacted socially constructed system of terms meanings premises and rules pertaining to communicative conduct This theory seeks to answer questions about the existence of speech codes their substance the way they can be discovered and their force upon people within a culture Griffin 2005 This theory deals with only one type of human behavior which is speech acts

A basic definition of speech code by sociologist Basil Bernstein is a coding principle is a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context

Work by Gerry Philipsen has been influential in the development of speech codes theory Work in the 1960s influences the theory as it stands today in the field of communication

Before speech codes theory got its name Philipsen first referred to this theory as the Ethnography of Communication He decided to change it because he recognized that many people could not get past the idea of Ethnography as simply a research method He was considered a naturalist who watched listened and recorded communicative conduct in a cultures natural setting Em Griffin stated that Many people cant get past the idea of ethnography as simply a research method With that being said Philipsen moved from description to explanation resulting in him labeling his work speech codes theory Philipsens ultimate goal was to develop a theory that would capture the relationship between communication and culture

The Speech Codes theory was created for ultimately two purposes The first was to distill some of what might be learned from a large body of fieldwork research on culturally distinctive ways of speaking The second was to provide a focus for further research and discussion The theory was first published in prototypical form with an introduction to the concept of speech codes and a presentation of four empirically grounded principles about speech codes It was presented as a formal theoretical statements with five empirical grounded propositions four of which were carried over intact from the earlier version Philipsen Coutu and Covarrubias

There were four questions that Philipsen sought to answer through his research on the Speech Code Theory

Works by Basil Bernstein heavily influenced Philipsen Bernstein used the term speech codes in sociology and further elaborated on speech codes and their contexts He stated that within the same society there can exist different social groups or social classes whose communicative practices differ in important ways Philipsen1997 Bernstein argues that people have different ways of speaking which shapes and reinforces their understanding of themselves other people and social life Bernstein believes that a coding principle is a rule governing what to say and how to say it in a particular context 

Lisa Coutu an ethnographer helped to formulate the second proposition of Speech Codes Theory This proposition states that within any given speech community there are multiple speech codes Her evidence comes from a large body of research surrounding Robert McNamaras book In Retrospect

Another important influence is the work of anthropologist and linguist Dell Hymes His focus was on local speech practices in various cultural and social situations

Dell Hymes constructed the SPEAKING model to aid in the search for speech codes in specific speech communities The letters stand for the following as reported by Miller


An often cited study the Teamsterville study was conducted by Philipsen in Chicago The study took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s According to Miller the Teamsterville nickname was given to the area of Chicago studied because the primary job of the areas men was truck driving For three years Philipsen spoke with everyone he could from a kid on the corner to the women on their front porches and men in bars Although the people all spoke English Philipsen could recognize the differences between their speech codes and his As a follow up another study the Nacirema American spelled backwards study was conducted that contrasted the speech of Teamsterville with that of the average American
The typical Nacirema speech is a generalized US conversation that is carried at the public level and at the interpersonal level in facetoface interaction

Using these two studies above Philipsen outlined statements that summarize the work within speech code theory The statements are reported by Em Griffin as follows

1 The distinctiveness of speech codes In any given culture there is a speech code

2 The multiplicity of speech codes Multiple speech codes exist in any given speech community

3 The substance of speech codes A speech code has a distinctive psychology sociology and rhetoric

4 The meaning of speech codes The speech community assesses the meanings of speech

5 The site of speech codes The terms premises and rules of a speech code are inextricably woven into the speech itself

6 The discursive force of speech codes Speech Codes impact life

According to Philipsen there are three defining characteristics of the speech codes theory and he illustrated these by referencing Carbaughs previous study The first characteristic being that speech codes are grounded in the observation of communication conduct in particular times and places Gudykunst 2005 Speech codes theory is concerned about observing communication conduct through noticing describing interpreting and explaining the findings The second is that speech codes present a way to interpret or explain observed communicative conduct by reference to situated codes of meaning and value Different meanings are interpreted in multiple ways depending on that communitys discursive life The last characteristic is that this theory provides a general understanding of communicative conduct

Philipsen characterizes the Speech Code Theory by stating that It is general in 3 ways It presents a characterization of the nature of all speech codes It contains a general answer to the question of how an observer might systematically try to learn about the particularities of particulars local ways of speaking It presents a general answer to the question of how speech codes relate to communicative conduct

According to Gerry Philipsen the Speech Codes Theory is a historically enacted socially constructed system of terms meanings premises and rules pertaining to communicative conduct One of his six general propositions is that wherever there is a distinctive culture there is to be found a distinctive speech code For example when we are immersed in a new community with a culture that is unfamiliar to us we often find certain patterns of speech to be strange Because we are an outsider we pick up on these differences initially Yet over time we grow accustomed to these patterns and no longer notice a difference in pronunciation andor grammar Speech codes are seen in the way a group determines when to communicate and what is appropriate to say at a particular time

Philipsen addresses the criticisms of Speech Code Theory by saying that

1 Speech Codes Theory does not account for manifestations of power in discourse This is a matter of omission in the theoretical assumptions methodological framework and examination of fieldwork materials

2 Speech Codes Theory treats culture as overly deterministic A corollary to this is that it reifies culture as a static entity 

This is a strong force of conduct within communication It has a social perspective that directly addresses the issue of a universal possibility in any body of discourse of manifestations of power solidarity intimacy and other important aspects of social life

Genshiro Kawamoto
Genshiro Kawamoto born 1932 is a Japanese businessman known for his real estate investments in Japan California and Hawaii He is also notable for controversial real estate investments in the late 1980s when he bought more than 170 properties including many Oahu homes More recently Kawamoto is known for owning 30 properties in the Khala area of Honolulu where he has allowed them to be run down attracting many complaints and media attention Although these homes are vacant boarded up and often vandalized their estimated total value is 200 million In September 2013 Kawamoto sold all of his Hawaii assets to Alexander and Baldwin for 128 million The transaction was brokered by Steve Sombrero president of NAI ChaneyBrooks

Born into a wealthy kimono shop owners family in what is now Kitakyushu Fukuoka Prefecture he went to Keio University but did not graduate

In 2006 Kawamoto announced that he would rent out some of the 18 homes he owns on Kahala Avenue most purchased for between 2 million and 20 million to native Hawaiian families for 150  200 per month

Kawamoto owns dozens of office buildings in Tokyo under the name Marugen and has been buying and selling real estate in Hawaii and California since the 1980s and had been accused of making money by driving real estate values down by various methods such as erecting statues destroying fences and removing landscaping and buying them out and then selling them when the price increased

He has been criticized for evicting tenants of his rental homes on short notice so he could sell the properties as in 2002 when he gave hundreds of California tenants 30 days to leave

Two years later he served eviction notices to tenants in 27 Oahu rental homes mostly in pricey Hawaii Kai saying they had to leave within a month He said he wanted to sell the houses to take advantage of rising prices

Some neighbors were unhappy with Kawamotos plans speculating that he was trying to drive down real estate values so he can snap up even more homes

Everyones paying homage to him but in reality hes the problem said Mark Blackburn who lives down the street from Kahales new home when interviewed by CNN on March 2007 Houses are homes Theyre made to live in they arent investment vehicles In response Kawamoto has responded by saying that the neighbors should leave if they dont want to live next to Hawaiians

Got Shjir
Count was a Japanese samurai and politician during the Bakumatsu and early Meiji period of Japanese history He was a leader of which would evolve into a political party

Got was born in Tosa Domain present day Kchi Prefecture Together with fellow Tosa samurai Sakamoto Ryma he was attracted by the radical proImperial Sonn ji movement After being promoted he essentially seized power within the Tosa Domains politics and exerted influence on Tosa daimy Yamauchi Toyoshige to call on shgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu to return power peacefully to the Emperor

After the Meiji Restoration Got was appointed to a number of posts including that of Governor of Osaka and sangi councillor but later from the Meiji government in 1873 over disagreement with the governments policy of restraint toward Korea ie the Seikanron debate and more generally in opposition to the ChshSatsuma domination of the new government Jointly with Itagaki Taisuke he submitted a memorandum calling for the establishment of a popularly elected parliament In 1874 together with Itagaki Taisuke and Et Shinpei and Soejima Taneomi of Hizen Province he formed the Aikoku Kt Public Party of Patriots declaring We the thirty millions of people in Japan are all equally endowed with certain definite rights among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty acquiring and possessing property and obtaining a livelihood and pursuing happiness These rights are by Nature bestowed upon all men and therefore cannot be taken away by the power of any man This antigovernment stance appealed to the discontented remnants of the samurai class and the rural aristocracy who resented centralized taxation and peasants who were discontented with high prices and low wages

After the Osaka Conference of 1875 he returned briefly to the government participating in the Genrin He also managed a coal mine in Kysh the Takashima Coal Mine but finding it to be losing money sold his interest to Iwasaki Yatar

Roscoe Snyder and Pacific Railway
The Roscoe Snyder and Pacific Railway was an American shortline railroad based in the small West Texas town of Roscoe

The Roscoe Snyder and Pacific Railway Company was incorporated August 31 1906 to construct a railroad from Roscoe Texas to the New Mexico state line near Portales The full line was never completed but a line was opened to Snyder in 1908 and extended another to Fluvanna in September 1909

The line was abandoned between Snyder and Fluvanna prior to 1945 and passenger service ended in 1953 The line between Roscoe and Snyder was abandoned in 1984 because of deregulation associated with the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 which made it difficult for the company to compete A small portion of the line that connects to the Union Pacific near Roscoe still serves a railroad car rebuilding facility and provides storage of rail cars awaiting repair

Old Middletown High School
The Old Middletown High School building in Middletown Connecticut in the United States occupies the southwest corner of Court and Pearl streets It is situated in a modestly scaled 19th century urban residential neighborhood Although integrated into its surroundings the old high school stands out because of its size and Romanesque Revival style

Built in 18941896 this building was Middletowns second high school The Hartford firm of Curtis  Johnson designed the structure in Romanesque Revival style The building for which no expense was spared in materials or design set an innovative standard for the educational facilities of its day

The use of different materials Pompeian brick brownstone and terra cotta produces a rich textural effect on the exterior A turret on the northeast corner the use of round compound arches and an overall asymmetrical plan are typical of Romanesque Revival

In 1912 a large wing designed by Charles Scranton Palmer of Meriden was added to the south side of the building This wing closely repeated the materials and stylistic elements of the existing structure A second large wing containing a library auditorium and gymnasium was added to the west side in 1931 Although it incorporates some Romanesque details such as sound compound arched windows and utilized materials compatible to the original the overall impression is of a separate and distinct construction

The old high school is one of the few monumental civic buildings of the 19th century remaining in Middletown and the only one of the Romanesque style It ceased operation as a high school in 1973

In 1978 the high school was converted into elderly housing apartments and the structure remains in good condition

In 2007 Middletown High School 2 off of Newfield Street was replaced by MHS 3 that was built in front of MHS 2 before 2 was torn down The old building is still elderly housing on the corner of Court and Pearl Streets

Forward Pass horse
Forward Pass March 28 1965  December 1 1980 was an American Thoroughbred Champion racehorse who is the only horse in the history of the Kentucky Derby to have been declared the winner as the result of a disqualification

Forward Pass was sired by OnandOn a halfbrother to Kentucky Derby winner Tim Tam who is also known as the damsire of Alydar His dam Princess Turia won the 1956 Kentucky Oaks as well as the BlackEyed Susan Stakes and Delaware Handicap during her racing career Princess Turias other progeny include graded stakes winner Turn to Turia and full brothers to Forward Pass Ever On Dinamode and Prince Turian

Prince Turian stood stallion duties in Venezuela Dinamode stood in the United States at Marablue Farm in Florida and Ever On had a brief stallion career in the United States at Winston Farm the farm of his owner Suzanne Perdue

Owned and bred by Calumet Farm the colt was trained by Henry Forrest

Racing at age three he won several graded stakes races including three important US Triple Crown prep races the Everglades Stakes the Florida Derby and the Blue Grass Stakes The betting favorite going into the 1968 Kentucky Derby Forward Pass finished second but winner Dancers Image was disqualified to last place after traces of phenylbutazone were discovered in the mandatory postrace urinalysis As a result Forward Pass was declared the winner The controversy over the first and still the only disqualification of a Derby winner filled the sporting news of every media outlet in North America and was the cover story for Sports Illustrated magazine which called it the sports story of the year It was revealed that Dancers Image had been plagued by sore ankles and on the Sunday prior to the Kentucky Derby his handlers had a veterinarian give the horse a phenylbutazone tablet a pain killer commonly used to relieve inflammation of the joints which was legal at many race tracks in the United States but not at Churchill Downs However it was still a legitimate practice as the medication would dissipate from the horses system during the six days before the Derby When the horses postDerby urinalysis revealed the phenylbutazone his owner and handlers believed someone else may have been motivated to give the colt another dose of the drug and they filed an appeal of the disqualification The Kentucky State Racing Commission examined the matter and ordered distribution of the purse with first money to Forward Pass This decision was upheld in April 1972 by Kentuckys highest court in Kentucky State Racing Commission v Fuller 481 SW2d 298 Ky 1972 In a subsequent decision the Commission ordered that Forward Pass be considered the winner of the 1968 Kentucky Derby and that his owners were to receive the Derbys gold cup

In a rematch with Dancers Image in the Preakness Stakes Forward Pass won by six lengths As the third leg of the US Triple Crown approached the Derby controversy raged on A victory by Forward Pass in the Belmont Stakes would make him the first Triple Crown winner in twenty years and many fans experts and racing commentators felt he would be an illegitimate champion In the Belmont Forward Pass finished second by one and a quarter lengths to Greentree Stables colt Stage Door Johnny a horse who had not raced in the Derby or the Preakness but had been specifically bred and conditioned for competing at longer distances

In 1968 the Turf and Sports Digest poll saw Forward Pass named as Champion 3YrOld Male The other two organizations Thoroughbred Racing Association and Daily Racing Form voted for Stage Door Johnny 

Retired at the end of the 1968 racing season to Calumet Farm Forward Pass was sent to stand at stud at Calumet Farm In 1977 he was sold to a breeding farm in Japan He died there in 1980

Even today controversy and speculation surrounds the 1968 Kentucky Derby and The New York Times calls the ruling the most controversial decision in all of Triple Crown racing The use of phenylbutazone was subsequently approved on March 6 1974 by the Kentucky Racing Commission in recognition of medical research that showed it does not enhance a horses performance

Chamberlin trimetric projection
The Chamberlin trimetric projection is a map projection where three points are fixed on the globe and the points on the sphere are mapped onto a plane by triangulation It was developed in 1946 by Wellman Chamberlin for the National Geographic Society
Chamberlin was chief cartographer for the Society from 1964 to 1971
The projections principal feature is that it compromises between distortions of area direction and distance A Chamberlin trimetric map therefore gives an excellent overall sense of the region being mapped
Many National Geographic Society maps of single continents use this projection

As originally implemented the projection algorithm begins with the selection of three points near the outer boundary of the area to be mapped From these three base points the true distances to a point on the mapping area are calculated The distances from each of the three base points are then drawn on the plane by compass circles Unlike triangulation on a plane where three such compass circles will intersect at a unique point the compass circles from a sphere do not intersect precisely at a point A small triangle is generated from the intersections and the center of this triangle is calculated as the mapped point
A Chamberlin trimetric projection map was originally obtained by graphically mapping points at regular intervals of latitude and longitude with shorelines and other features then mapped by interpolation Based on the principles of the projection precise but lengthy mathematical formulas were later developed for calculating this projection by computer for a spherical earth

The Chamberlin trimetric projection is neither conformal nor equalarea Rather the projection was conceived to minimize distortion of distances everywhere with the sideeffect of balancing between areal equivalence and conformality This projection is not appropriate for mapping the entire sphere because the outer boundary would loop and overlap itself in most configurations

Unocal Corp v Mesa Petroleum Co
Unocal v Mesa Petroleum Co 493 A2d 946 Del 1985 is a landmark decision of the Delaware Supreme Court on corporate defensive tactics against takeover bids

Until the Unocal decision in 1985 the Delaware courts had applied the business judgment rule when appropriate to takeover defenses mergers and sales

In Unocal the Court held that a board of directors may only try to prevent a takeover where it can be shown that there was a threat to corporate policy and the defensive measure adopted was proportional and reasonable given the nature of the threat

This requirement has become known as the Unocal test for board of directors as later modified in Unitrin Inc v American General Corp which required the tactics to be coercive or preclusive before the court would step in

Mesa Petroleum had made a frontend loaded twotiered hostile bid for Unocal Corporation in which the front end was 54 in cash and the back end of the deal was 54 in junk bonds Because most shareholders would prefer to receive the cash instead of the bonds shareholders were expected to tender their shares into the deal even if they did not think 54 was a fair price If a shareholder declined to tender that shareholder risked being cashedout for 54 in risky debt instruments instead of cash

In response to the Mesa tender offer Unocal made a selftender at 72 for all but the Mesa shares The Unocal board attempted to launch a selftender offer to combat an unsolicited tender offer by Mesa Petroleum Mesa The selftender offer would be triggered upon Mesa acquiring sixtyfour million shares of Unocal and would mean that Unocal itself would buyback 49 of the outstanding shares of Unocal  but none of the shares to be boughtback could be shares held by Mesa

The trial court found that this selective exchange offer was not legally permissible and issued a preliminary injunction against the use of the selftender offer defense

The Delaware Supreme Court reversed the trial court

It found that the Unocals board of directors had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger to corporate policy or effectiveness existed and that the response was reasonable in relation to the threat posed This reasonable relation analysis permitted an analysis of the price nature and timing of the offer as well as the impact on shareholders creditors customers employees and the community Note that this permission to consider other constituencies besides the shareholders was curtailed in Revlon v MacAndrews

The Unocal test the court established in this case to determine whether directors may try to prevent a takeover is a two pronged test The two prongs include

Note that whereas Cheff v Mathes had sanctioned greenmail or payment to the raider to go away in Unocal the court sanctioned reverse greenmail or payment to shareholders excluding the raider

The significance of the opinion flows from the courts premise that due to the inherent conflict of interest involved takeover defenses pose a significant danger to shareholders In essence the Unocal court feared that a board may use takeover defenses to impermissibly prevent threats to corporate policy or to the boards control over the corporation As a result there was a need for an enhanced duty on the board so as to ensure that their decisions in this area were meant only to further the welfare of the corporation and its shareholders Therefore the court ruled that in order for the board to be allotted the protection of the business judgment rule the board must demonstrate that it was responding to a legitimate threat to corporate policy and effectiveness and that its actions were reasonable in relation to the threat posed

GuyAndr Kieffer
GuyAndr Kieffer born 25 May 1949 is a journalist of dual French and Canadian nationality who worked in West Africa generally and in Cte dIvoire specifically On April 16 2004 he was kidnapped from an Abidjan parking lot and has not been seen since In early 2012 remains suspected to belong to Kieffer were found in the department of Issia in the west of Cte dIvoire

Kieffer was born and raised in France his family lives in the region of RhneAlpes He studied law in Montreal and while there married a Canadian woman and obtained Canadian nationality this marriage produced a son SbastienCdric but later resulted in divorce Kieffer was married to Osange SilouKieffer they have a daughter Canelle

From 1984 to 2002 Kieffer worked for the French financial newspaper La Tribune Following this he worked in West Africa for a number of years and wrote articles concerning Political corruption in African governments for several different publications

Among these publications were his former newspaper La Tribune and also La Lettre du Continent as well as several Ivorian newspapers

At approximately 1 pm on April 16 2004 Kieffer was kidnapped in the parking lot of a shopping center in Abidjan At the time he was working on a story about money laundering and illegal currency transfers allegedly involving the Ivorian government

He had been drawn there by someone claiming to have leads on a government corruption story he was assembling He has never been seen since nor has a corpse been found To this day his fate and the identity of his kidnappers remains a mystery

In a 2006 interview regarding her book Bitter Chocolate CBC journalist Carol Off claimed that Kieffers disappearance and probable murder was related to his investigation of the shady practices involving the Ivorian government and the cocoa industry She had travelled to Cte dIvoire to research her book and claimed that upon her arrival in the country Canadian embassy officials had given her a stern warning regarding Kieffer

In May 2004 civil proceedings concerning Kieffers disappearance were launched in France by Kieffers family and Reporters sans frontires The French magistrate charged with the case was sent to Abidjan and there interrogated Michel Legr a brotherinlaw of the wife of Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo who was allegedly the last person to see Kieffer alive Legr provided a list of names of influential Ivorians who he alleged were involved in Kieffers kidnapping

This list of names was subsequently published in some Ivorian newspapers In 2004 Legr was arrested in Abidjan by Ivorian police and charged with complicity in a kidnapping illegal imprisonment and murder He was also charged with defamation for naming the individuals on the list Legr was provisionally released in 2005 and has since fled the country  or is in an unknown location

Subsequently the French magistrate was not granted access to all of the persons named by Legr The magistrate questioned Legr himself on 21 October 2004 and on 13 December 2004 requested that Legr be temporarily moved to France as he felt Legr was unable to speak freely in his Ivorian prison However the French government initially did not aid in this request for which they were denounced by Kieffers wife Osange SilouKieffer

On August 23 2007 French president Nicolas Sarkozy met with Kieffers wife Osange SilouKieffer in Paris and expressed his determination to aid in the case SilouKieffer claimed that Sarkozys predecessor Jacques Chirac had never answered her request for a meeting

SilouKieffer indicated she had asked Sarkozy to pressure Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo to allow French judges to interrogate Ivorian suspects in the case

In July 2008 Simone Gbagbo  First Lady of Cte dIvoire  was formally called for questioning by a French investigative judge examining the April 2004 disappearance and presumed death of Kieffer Speculation has surrounded the Ivorian first family as Michel Legr is the brotherinlaw of Simone Gbagbo French judicial officials have arrested and are investigating JeanTony Oula a former member of the Ivorian Secret Services whom they detained in Paris in 2006 JeanTony Oulas driver at the time Berte Seydou as well as Mr Kieffers brother have alleged that Ms Gbagbo and former Ivorian Minister of Planning and Development PaulAntoine Bohoun Bouabr have knowledge of the events surrounding Mr Kieffers death and that Oula is responsible

<doc id="7711449" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711449" title="Type 4 KeNu light tank">
Type 4 KeNu light tank
The was a light tank of the Imperial Japanese Army in World War II It was a conversion of existing Type 95 HaGo light tanks refitted with the larger turret of the Type 97 ChiHa medium tank

The Type 4 KeNu was a variant of the Type 95 HaGo light tank The original Type 97 ChiHa medium tank was armed with a low muzzle velocity 57mm tank gun Operational experience against the Soviet Red Army at Nomonhan during the SovietJapanese border conflicts in 1939 revealed that this gun was inadequate against opposing armor and a new higher velocity 47mm tank gun was developed This was installed in the Type 97 ChiHa with a larger turret to produce the Type 97kai Shinhoto version This left a large number of surplus Type 97 ChiHa turrets which were later retrofitted onto the hulls of the obsolete Type 95 HaGo light tank The result was designated the Type 4 KeNu The retrofitting did decrease the problem of cramped turret place for the crew which had been encountered in an earlier attempt to upgun Type 95 tanks with a 57 mm tank gun in a modified turret of a prototype known as the Type 3 KeRi light tank As for the Type 4 KeNu approximately 100 units were converted in 1944

Essentially a Type 95 light tank with a Type 97 medium tank gun turret the Type 4 KeNu had slightly better firepower but the retrofitting increased the weight of the tank to 84 tons This reduced the top speed of the tank to 40kmh Given the replacement turret had thicker armor it did provide the crew with some additional protection in that area but did nothing to alleviate the Type 95s greatest weakness of the lack of suitable armor protection for the hull Maximum armor protection for the tank 25mm was provided by the Type 97 turret but it was defeated by the 37mm 75mm and 2pounders mounted on Allied tanks

The conversion coming in 1944 was too late to make any impact on Japanese combat operations and most of the Type 4 KeNu were retained in the Japanese home islands in anticipation of the projected American invasion Some were assigned to units in Korea and Manchukuo and saw brief combat against Soviet forces in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria A surviving Type 4 KeNu captured in Manchukuo is on display in Moscow at the Kubinka Tank Museum

Moi has announced his intentions and is expected to run in the 2022 Kenyan presidential elections which will test his political abilities and his ability to fundraise either from his wealth or from his supporters Even though he is not now seen as popular as Ruto it is worth noting there is no national audience poll with him head to head with Ruto He has continued to serve as a senator and Chairman of the Senate ICT Committee instead of the Cabinet Secretary in Uhuru Kenyattas government which was speculated in January 2018

K5 mostly parallels the Missouri River for its entire run The roads direction signs changed from westeast to northsouth around 2010 although portions of it in Kansas City are still signed westeast

In 2015 The Kansas state legislature passed Statute 681038 which designation the portion of K5 between US73K7 to I435 then from I435 to US69 and southward on US69 to the Oklahoma border as the Frontier Military Scenic Byway

Originally the portion of K5 between I635 and US69 in Kansas was planned to be designated as I635 The interstate was planned to head eastward from where it meets K5 until it meets US69 at which point it would turn northward and cross the Fairfax Bridge over the Missouri River However the plan was never carried out and the highway segment between I635 and US69 in the northern area of Kansas City was to be designated as K6 In 1981 K6 became part of K5

Giovanni Punto
Jan Vclav Stich better known as Giovanni Punto 28 September 1746 in ehuice Bohemia  16 February 1803 in Prague Bohemia was a Czech horn player and a pioneer of the handstopping technique which allows natural horns to play a greater number of notes

Stich was born in ehuice in Bohemia His father was a serf bonded to the estate of Count Joseph Johann von Thun but Stich was taught singing violin and finally the horn The Count sent him to study horn under Joseph Matiegka in Prague Jan Schindelarz in Munich and finally with A J Hampel in Dresden from 1763 to 1764 Hampel first taught Stich the handstopping technique which he later improved and extended

Stich then returned to the service of the Count where he remained for the next four years At the age of 20 Stich and four friends ran away from the estate The Count who had invested heavily in Stichs education dispatched soldiers with orders to knock out Stichs front teeth to prevent him ever playing the horn again but they failed to capture the group and Stich crossed into Italy into the Holy Roman Empire

On arriving in Italy Stich changed his name to Giovanni Punto an approximate Italianisation of his name and went to work in the orchestra of Josef Friedrich Wilhelm Prince of HohenzollernHechingen From there he moved to Mainz to the court orchestra but left after a few years when they did not give him the post of Konzertmeister After this he began to travel and play as a soloist touring much of Europe including England Charles Burney heard him play in Koblenz in 1772 describing Punto as the celebrated French horn from Bohemia whose taste and astonishing execution were lately so applauded in London

Punto was particularly active in Paris playing there 49 times between 1776 and 1788 but his use of handstopping was criticized by some in London possibly due to the novelty of the technique In 1777 he was invited to teach the horn players in the private orchestra of George III

Punto also composed pieces to demonstrate his own virtuosity a common practice then which indicate that he was a master of quick arpeggios and stepwise passagework

In 1778 Punto met Mozart in Paris after which Mozart reported to his father Leopold that Punto plays magnifique The same year Punto probably entered into an arrangements with some Parisian publishers nearly all his subsequent compositions were published in Paris whereas they were previously listed in Breitkopfs catalogue A new horn was also made for him in 1778 a silver cor solo which he used for the rest of his life

Punto sought a permanent position in which he could conduct as well as compose and play and in 1781 he entered the service of Franz Ludwig von Erthal the Princebishop of Wrzburg later moving to become the Konzertmeister with a pension for the Comte dArtois later to become Charles X of France in Paris He was successful enough in this role that in 1787 he was able to secure leave of absence and tour the Rhineland in his own coach a mark of considerable wealth at the time

On returning to Paris in 1789 Punto was appointed conductor of the Thtre des Varits Amusantes where he remained for ten years leaving in 1799 when he was not appointed to the staff of the newly founded Paris Conservatoire Moving on to Vienna via Munich Punto met Ludwig van Beethoven who wrote his Op 17 Sonata for Horn and Piano for the two of them They premiered the work on 18 April 1800 at the Burgtheater and played the work again the following month in Pest Hungary

In 1801 Punto returned to his homeland after 33 years playing a grand concert on 18 May in the National Theatre in Prague A reviewer commented that Punto received enthusiastic applause for his concertos because of his unparalleled mastery and respected musicians said that they had never before heard horn playing like it The reviewer commented on his innovative techniques noting that in his cadenzas he produced many novel effects playing two and even threepart chords and added that Punto was evidence that Bohemia was able to produce great artistic and musical geniuses

In 1802 after a short trip to Paris Punto developed pleurisy a common illness among wind players He died five months later on 16 February 1803 being accorded a magnificent funeral in the Church of St Nicholas attended by thousands Mozarts Requiem was performed at the graveside

Franz Joseph Frhlich wrote that what distinguished Punto in a way that one has never heard in any other artist heretofore was his most magnificent performance the gentlest portrayals the thunder of tones and their sweetest indescribable blending of nuances with the most varied tone production an agile tongue dexterous in all forms of articulation single and double tones and even chords but most important a silverbright and charming cantabile tone

<doc id="7711708" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711708" title="Mail coach">
Mail coach
In Great Britain a mail coach was a stagecoach built to a Post Officeapproved design operated by an independent contractor to carry longdistance mail for the Post Office Mail was held in a box at the rear where the only Royal Mail employee an armed guard stood Passengers were taken at a premium fare There was seating for four passengers inside and more outside with the driver The guards seat could not be shared This distribution system began in 1784 In Ireland the same service began in 1789

A mail coach service ran to an exact and demanding schedule Aside from quick changes of horses the coach only stopped for collection and delivery of mail and never for the comfort of the passengers To avoid a steep fine turnpike gates had to be open by the time the mail coach with its right of free passage passed through The gatekeeper was warned by the sound of the posthorn

Mail coaches were slowly phased out during the 1840s and 1850s their role eventually replaced by trains as the railway network expanded

The postal delivery service in Britain had existed in the same form for about 150 years  from its introduction in 1635 mounted carriers had ridden between posts where the postmaster would remove the letters for the local area before handing the remaining letters and any additions to the next rider The riders were frequent targets for robbers and the system was inefficient

John Palmer a theatre owner from Bath believed that the coach service he had previously run for transporting actors and materials between theatres could be utilised for a countrywide mail delivery service so in 1782 he suggested to the Post Office in London that they take up the idea He met resistance from officials who believed that the existing system could not be improved but eventually the Chancellor of the Exchequer William Pitt allowed him to carry out an experimental run between Bristol and London Under the old system the journey had taken up to 38 hours The coach funded by Palmer left Bristol at 4pm on 2 August 1784 and arrived in London just 16 hours later

Impressed by the trial run Pitt authorised the creation of new routes By the end of 1785 there were services from London to Norwich Liverpool Leeds Dover Portsmouth Poole Exeter Gloucester Worcester Holyhead and Carlisle A service to Edinburgh was added the next year and Palmer was rewarded by being made Surveyor and Comptroller General of the Post Office

Initially the coach horses and driver were all supplied by contractors There was strong competition for the contracts as they provided a fixed regular income on top of which the companies could charge fares for the passengers By the beginning of the 19th century the Post Office had their own fleet of coaches with black and maroon livery The early coaches were poorly built but in 1787 the Post Office adopted John Besants improved and patented design after which Besant with his partner John Vidler enjoyed a monopoly on the supply of coaches and a virtual monopoly on their upkeep and servicing

The mail coaches continued unchallenged until the 1830s but the development of railways spelt the end for the service The first rail delivery between Liverpool and Manchester took place on 11 November 1830 By the early 1840s other rail lines had been constructed and many Londonbased mail coaches were starting to be withdrawn from service the final service from London to Norwich was shut down in 1846 Regional mail coaches continued into the 1850s but these too were eventually replaced by rail services

The mail coaches were originally designed for a driver seated outside and up to four passengers inside The guard the only Post Office employee on the coach travelled on the outside at the rear next to the mail box Later a further passenger was allowed outside sitting at the front next to the driver and eventually a second row of seating was added behind him to allow two further passengers to sit outside Travel could be uncomfortable as the coaches travelled on poor roads and passengers were obliged to dismount from the carriage when going up steep hills to spare the horses as Charles Dickens describes at the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities The coaches averaged 7 to 8mph 1113kmh in summer and about 5mph 8kmh in winter but by the time of Queen Victoria the roads had improved enough to allow speeds of up to 10mph 16kmh Fresh horses were supplied every 10 to 15 miles 1624km Stops to collect mail were short and sometimes there would be no stops at all with the guard throwing the mail off the coach and snatching the new deliveries from the postmaster

The cost of travelling by mail coach was about 1d a mile more expensive than by private stage coach but the coach was faster and in general less crowded and cleaner Crowding was a common problem with private stage coaches which led to them overturning the limits on numbers of passengers and luggage prevented this occurring on the mail coaches Travel on the mail coach was nearly always at night as the roads were less busy the coach could make better speed

The guard was heavily armed with a blunderbuss and two pistols and dressed in the Post Office livery of maroon and gold The mail coaches were thus well defended against highwaymen and accounts of robberies often confuse them with private stage coaches though robberies did occur
To prevent corruption and ensure good performance the guards were paid handsomely and supplied with a generous pension The mail was their sole charge meaning that they had to deliver it on foot if a problem arose with the coach and unlike the driver they remained with the coach for the whole journey occasionally guards froze to death from hypothermia in their exposed position outside the coach during the harsh winters see River Thames frost fairs The guard was supplied with a timepiece and a posthorn the former to ensure the schedule was met the latter to alert the post house to the imminent arrival of the coach and warn tollgate keepers to open the gate mail coaches were exempt from stopping and paying tolls a fine was payable if the coach was forced to stop Since the coaches had right of way on the roads the horn was also used to advise other road users of their approach

A twiceweekly stage coach service operated between Dublin and Drogheda to the north Kilkenny to the south and Athlone to the west as early as 1737 and for a short period from 1740 a Dublin to Belfast stage coach existed In winter this last route took three days with overnight stops at Drogheda and Newry in summer travel time was reduced to two days

In 1789 mail coaches began a scheduled service from Dublin to Belfast They met the mail boats coming from Portpatrick in Scotland at Donaghadee in County Down

By the mid19th century most of the mail coaches in Ireland were eventually outcompeted by Charles Bianconis countrywide network of open carriages before this system in turn succumbed to the railways

Australias first mail coach was established in 1828 and was crucial in connecting the remote settlements being established to the larger centres The first mail contracts were issued and mail was transported by coach or on horseback from Sydney to the first seven country post offices  Penrith Parramatta Liverpool Windsor Campbelltown Newcastle and Bathurst The Sydney to Melbourne overland packhorse mail service was commenced in 1837 From 1855 the Sydney to Melbourne overland mail coach was supplanted by coastal steamer ship and rail The rail network became the distributor of mail to larger regional centres there the mail coach met the trains and carried the mail to more remote towns and villages

In 1863 contracts were awarded to the coaching company Cobb  Co to transport Royal Mail services within New South Wales and Victoria These contracts and later others in Queensland continued until 1924 when the last service operated in western Queensland The lucrative mail contracts helped Cobb  Co grow and become an efficient and vast network of coach services in eastern Australia

Royal Mail coach services reached their peak in the later decades of the 19th century operating over thousands of miles of eastern Australia In 1870s Cobb  Cos Royal Mail coaches were operating some 6000 horses per day and traveling 28000 miles weekly carrying mail gold and general parcels

Some Concord stagecoaches were imported from the United States made in New Hampshire by the AbbotDowning Company This design was a thoroughbrace or jack style coach characterized by an elegant curved lightweight body suspended on two large leather straps which helped to isolate the passengers and driver from the jolts and bumps of the rough unmade country roads Soon Australian coach builders using many of the Concord design features customized the design for Australian conditions

Lennard grew up in Bristol England and was educated at Bristol Grammar School and New College Oxford His doctoral thesis on the use of brackets in English literature was published by the Clarendon Press as the monograph But I Digress and called both a delighthouse of a book and the strangest book I think I have ever reviewed He taught at the Open University the University of London and the University of Cambridge before taking up his present chair at UWI He is also a member of the Global Virtual Faculty of Fairleigh Dickinson University and the general editor of the Genre Fiction Sightlines and Monographs series for HumanitiesEBooks

Beyond his unusual work on punctuation Lennards major work has been in literary handbooks for students in the last years of school and first of college The Poetry Handbook A Guide to Reading Poetry for Pleasure and Practical Criticism OUP 1996 2nd edition 2005 has now sold more than 25000 copies and has an associated website It was followed by The Drama Handbook A Guide to Reading Plays cowritten with Mary Luckhurst Professor of Modern Drama at the University of York trying to bridge the gap between textbased literary and more performative teaching

Lennards more recent involvement with work on genre fiction particularly Crime Writing Science fiction and Childrens literature reflects a long history of unliterary reading and interest in literature as a means of living as well as a subject of aesthetic and historical study He has variously protested the application of class snobbery to literature and But I Digress features parentheses by Elvis Costello and Robert B Parker as well as chapters on Marvell Coleridge and T S Eliot Both Handbooks were similarly eclectic in choosing examples and his annotated edition of the awardwinning Jamaican versenovel View from Mount Diablo by Ralph Thompson considers both the crime novel and the Bildungsroman as models

Lennards former students include Steven Poole of The Guardian Tristram Stuart and screenwriter Helen Raynor

<doc id="7711779" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7711779" title="Arthur Allen Leff">
Arthur Allen Leff
Arthur Allen Leff 19351981 was a professor of law at Yale Law School who is best known for a series of articles examining whether there is such a thing as a normative law or morality Leff answers this question in the negative and follows the consequences to their logical conclusions

Leffs first major work Economic Analysis of the Law Some Realism About Nominalism is putatively a book review of Richard Posners Economic Analysis of the Law In actuality it is a critique of the use of any single methodology to provide normative rules for law and morality The article is still today the main critique of Posners work and economic analysis generally and is usually read in graduate seminars on Economic Analysis though sometimes misidentified as the Legal Realist critique Leff makes two fundamental propositions in Some Realism About Nominalism 1 that all models are only very limited views of the real world When Posner views the world through the economic model much more is hidden than is revealed 2 there is no system of logic for preferring one model eg economic social political over another unless an axiom is inserted early on into that system of logic Leff notes that the opening of Posners work does just thatinserts a proposition that rational economic behavior is to be preferred to other behavior Leff follows his insight to its logical conclusion and notes that similarly there is no way using logic to prove that any particular act no matter how horrible is normatively wrong Put it another way one can never prove to another person that a particular set of behaviors is right or that a different set of behaviors is wrong He states

Leff continues his critique of attempts to find normative rules in law and morality in Law and Technology On shoring up a Void Unspeakable Ethics Unnatural Law alluding to the title of a collection of stories by Donald Barthelme and his review of Robert Ungers Knowledge and Politics in the form of a letter from The Devil In these works Leff attempts to directly address whether a normative morality can exist without God Leff answers the question in the negative Leff states that absent an ultimate authority figure ie God handing down moral laws from onhigh there is no reason for any person to prefer one set of behavior identified as moral to another Leff terms this the Grand Sez Who In particular it is impossible to resolve the conflict between the rights of the individual and the power of the collective even though much of the time we can pretend that for instance the Constitution tells us where to draw the line There are bound to be cases where we are left on our own with no authoritative referee there is no brooding omnipresence in the sky in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr whom Leff quotes approvingly

In Unspeakable Ethics Unnatural Law Leff also criticizes the views of Robert Nozick and Roberto Unger noting that for all their differences they end up with remarkably similar solutions to the problem of resolving differences among morally sovereign individuals agglomerations of the likeminded geographically separated Leff claims that this move merely shifts the problem Against Nozick Leff states that his entire book Anarchy State and Utopia is built on the naked assertion that individuals have rights and that an entirely different yet equally valid argument could be built on the premise individuals have duties The arbitrary choice of starting point decides everything

Leff states as follows in the closing of Unspeakable Ethics Unnatural Law

In Swindling and Selling Leff presented a wry analysis of the blurry lines between what we consider honest salesmanship and illegal fraud Not all selling is swindling but all swindling is selling Leff explains He shows how both sellers and swindlers have to overcome similar forms of buyer resistance Leff explains these dynamics in the language of Erving Goffman and through some use of behavioral economics

In the case of swindling con artists weave a dramaturgy where they hold a monopoly over some valuable asset and the mark is set up as monopsonist an exclusive buyer with access to a special deal The scheme is premised on mutual need and policing of these schemes is difficult because for part of the transaction the mark is a willing participant Here Leff describes scams such as the Spanish Prisoner where a mark is promised great riches if he will only bribe some minor official to free the holder of the treasure the modern version of this includes the 419 scheme Leff then pans out to show how the elements of swindling are present in some political and religious movements although these may not be scams The ancient estate scam where marks are convinced that a fantastic old property was improperly distributed making many modernday people claimants to it is similar to political movements to repatriate lands Godcons are con games where the conmaninduces one or more marks to trade moneyof this world value in exchange for the promised delivery of quantities of exceedingly valuable divinely manufactured goods Pyramid schemes operate by distracting marks from the opportunity costs of their labor and by getting them emotionally attached to a swindle instead of more viable employment

Leff then switches from bunco to legal selling In a perfect market bargains should not exist Thus sellers must create a plausible dramaturgy to explain why a buyer gets a bargain This could be a clearance sale with praises the buyer as parsimonious while implying that less careful consumers are getting the antibargain Leff then turns to mass advertising which relies upon several predicable cons the sufficiency switch and the Calvinist causation The former refers to the many products that suggest some cause and effect between the purchase of a product and some goalclear up ones complexion with a skin cream and get the girl The latter is Leffs term for positional objects the Cadillac or the Mercedes These things operate from an opposite logic They do not make one successful they license a script and a prop to the mark Buy this symbol with which you can advertise powerfully and convincingly that you are what you and those about whose opinions you care devoutly wish to be

Leff was an agnostic but his writings have been influential on Christian discussions of morality in the modern era Phillip E Johnson has suggested that Leffs work is really a critique of the God is dead argument Johnson argues that the presence of evil in the world is evidence that there is an absolute morality which requires an absolute authority Other Christian scholars have also applied Leffs critique to secular arguments for a normative morality 

Posner has responded to Leff by stating that the purpose of any methodology or model is to simplify Otherwise it would be impossible to achieve any kind of understanding of the real world

In Grounding Normative Assertions Arthur Leffs Still Irrefutable but Incomplete Sez Who Critique 20 J L  Religion 31 20042005 Washington and Lee University Law Professor Sam Calhoun agrees with Leff that attempts to ground secular universal norms are doomed to fail Calhoun argues though that Leffs critique of moral norms is incomplete because Leff ignores a Godbased morality If God is introduced normative assumptions can be securely grounded although Calhoun acknowledges that looking to God for moral truth has many challenges

Monday Creek
Monday Creek is a tributary of the Hocking River 27 miles 435km long in southeastern Ohio in the United States Via the Hocking and Ohio Rivers it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River draining an area of 116 square miles 300km on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau Monday Creek has been badly affected by acid mine drainage

Monday Creek rises north of Shawnee in southern Perry County and flows generally southwardly through northeastern Hocking County and northwestern Athens County passing through the eastern part of Nelsonville to its confluence with the Hocking River about 2 miles 3km southeast of that city Its largest tributaries are Little Monday Creek 143 miles 23km long which flows through Perry and Hocking Counties and the Snow Fork 107 miles 172km long which rises in Perry County and flows through Hocking and Athens Counties through the communities of Murray City and Buchtel
As of 1994 land use in the Monday Creek watershed was occupied this way

The Wayne National Forest owns 38 of land in the watershed the largest private landowner is the Sunday Creek Mining Company

The Adena who lived in the region around 1000 BC were the earliest known inhabitants of the Monday Creek area Later native people of the region included the Lenape Shawnee and Wyandot According to legend early European explorers of the region named the stream for the day on which it was discovered The previous day the explorers had similarly named nearby Sunday Creek The earliest white settlements in the area date to 1774 the Ohio Company purchased all the land in the watershed in two installments in 1787 and 1792

The aggressive pursuit of natural resources including coal timber salt iron and clay took its toll on the watershed from the mid19th century until well into the 20th century Iron production in the area aided the North during the Civil War As much as 89 of the Monday Creek watershed was deforested by 1885 with replanting beginning with the establishment of the Wayne National Forest in 1935 Salt mining occurred in the watershed in the 19th century clay brick production peaked in the early 20th century oil and natural gas production began in 1909

The earliest coal mines in the watershed can be traced to the 1860s Early mines were underground a practice which was in sharp decline by the 1920s and had ended completely in the watershed by 1991 Surface mining was begun postWorld War II and declined in the 1970s Coal in the watershed is primarily of the Middle Kittaning 6 variety which is high in sulfur and has been identified by the Ohio EPA as having a high potential for pollution

The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency has identified Monday Creek as having been irretrievably altered to the extent that no appreciable aquatic life can be supported due to severe contamination by acid mine drainage

The Monday Creek Restoration Project sponsored by Rural Action has been working since 1994 to address water quality issues in the Monday Creek watershed

List of EastEnders twohander episodes

Typically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship and intense interactions between two prominent characters Structuring the episode in this way allows for indepth focus on a specific characterstoryline that would be impossible to achieve in the fastmoving and rapidly cut regular episodes It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode

Practically these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes as while the two actors were filming the twohander the remaining cast could be filming another episode

The first twohander features Den Watts Leslie Grantham and Angie Watts Anita Dobson and is structured like a tennis match with a nonspeaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action The episode is written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird This episode was watched by 140 million viewers in its original broadcast Writers chose to give Den and Angie a twohander episode due to their popularity

Den and Angies marriage has broken down and before the episode Den finally decides to end the marriage and leave Angie for his mistress Jan Hammond Jane How The episode begins with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wants to leave her and get a divorce Angie stalls but Den persists and explains to her that he wants a clean break from her their pub The Queen Victoria Albert Square and Walford Den tells Angie that he shall get another pub through a deal with James WilmottBrown William Boyde and Jan would be doing the books Angie is shocked and feels defeated but she then reveals that she is terminally ill with only six months to live Den does not believe her but Angie explains her story to Den Angies hysterical performance eventually convinces him Den crumbles and promises to stay with her adding that he will kill Angie if she is lying Consumed by guilt Den asks Angie for her forgiveness As Den leaves Angie alone and takes their dog Roly for a walk she gives a deranged smile revealing that she has been lying to Den

As Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him holding his hand Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend Nigel Bates Paul Bradley had persuaded him As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him He asked him if thats what it was like with Sharon Did she come onto him And why didnt he tell him Phil told him it wasnt like that but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper Phil tried to tell him that Sharon wasnt a slut but his protests fell on deaf ears Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull He wouldnt answer but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didnt even have to get out of first gear

They then began to talk about their relationship how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharons problem After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon He was planning to crush her like a table tennis ball and make her pay for what shed done Phil warned him not to do anything stupid which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didnt stick together Grant would end up back in prison He promised Grant that hed do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on it will be just the two of them

Pat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her but convinced herself that he merely didnt see her Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank but Peggy took a lot of convincing and they both traded insults at each other Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot but Peggy couldnt accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath Peggy began to sob Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank Pat didnt quite deny it but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too

After opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself saying that she was cursed and turned rich happy men into disasters  Roy was broke and impotent whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her was back to his old virile self Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasnt important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down

After the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless Peggy pestered them for some information which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if shed wanted to the night before he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy mutton dressed as lamb and Peggy blaming Pats appearance for Roys impotence Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy saying YOU BITCH and Peggy slapping Pat right back exclaiming YOU COW right before the doorbell rang

Occurring simultaneously to the Pat Evans Pam St Clement and Peggy Mitchell Barbara Windsor twohander described above this episode featured Roy Evans Tony Caunter and Frank Butcher Mike Reid After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision

Frank followed Roys car as he sped off extremely erratically Eventually Roy turned into a multistorey car park drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble He then made his way to the roof and stood on the edge contemplating suicide Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down saying he should think about his family who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier Roy claimed that he didnt see her but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything so there was no point living Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk promising that if he felt the same afterwards he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think as he once tried to commit suicide too was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then but for Roy it wasnt too late

Plumb House Middletown Connecticut
The Plumb House is a historic house at 872 Westfield Street in Middletown Connecticut USA It was built in 1804 by James Plumb and is exceptionally well preserved It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978

The house is built with clapboard sidings a brownstone foundation and an asphalt shingle roof It has a wood frame with post and beam construction and a hip roof The architect and builder are unknown Historically and currently it has been a private residence

James Plumb a welltodo farmer in Westfield built this house in 1804 on land inherited from his father Samuel Plumb The house remained in the PlumbBarry family until 1888 since then it has passed through a succession of owners while retaining its traditional residential usage

This finelyscaled Federal style frame house is of a central hall plan its exterior displays a symmetrical fivebay facade with hip roof and twin chimneys A denticulated main cornice and delicate window caps add decorative interest to the facade while attention is drawn to the entrance by a columned porch with cove ceiling The possibility exists that the northeast kitchen wing is Samuel Plumbs own dwelling house built around 1740 and relegated to a minor role as an attached dependency by the subsequent construction of James Plumbs Mansion House

The large original condition of this house together with its distinctive appearance and compatible site makes it a rare and pleasing example of early Federal style architecture in Middletown

This house faces south from the northeast corner of Westfield and East Streets Tall shade trees shield the house from the nearby roads Neighboring structures date from postWorld War II development of this formerly rural area

<doc id="7712057" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712057" title="Christianity in Mongolia">
Christianity in Mongolia
Christianity in Mongolia is a minority religion As of 2005 the United States Department of State reports that approximately 24000 Christians live in Mongolias capital Ulaanbaatar which is around 25 percent of the entire registered population of the city

Most Christians in Mongolia became Christian after the end of Mongolias communist regime in 1990 According to the Christian missionary group Barnabas Fund the number of Christians grew from just four in 1989 to around 40000 as of 2008

According to the 2010 National Census there were 41117 Christians age of 15 and older or 21 of total population

Nestorianism was the first form of Christianity to be proselytized among the Mongols in the 7th century and several Mongol tribes became primarily Christian During the rise of the Mongol Empire in the 13th century the Great Khans though mostly Shamanists and Buddhist were religiously tolerant towards the Nestorian Christians Muslims and Manichaeans Many of the khans had Nestorian Christian wives from the Kerait clan who were extremely influential in the Mongol court During the rule of Mngke Khan Christianity was the primary religious influence After the breakup of the Mongol Empire in the 14th century Nestorian Christianity nearly disappeared from the region

There are only very few archeological traces of the prospering of Nestorianism among the Mongols In Inner Mongolia several Nestorian gravestones have been recorded in the past but none now remain in situ

The Orthodox Churches and its monks became victims to the Mongol invasion of Eastern Europe in the early 13th century However Jarlig or charter of immunity also contributed to the strengthening of the Church With the reign of MngkeTemr a jarlig was issued to Metropolitan Kirill for the Orthodox Church in 1267 While the church had been under the de facto protection of the Mongols ten years earlier from the 1257 census conducted under Khan Berke this jarlig formally decreed protection for the Orthodox Church More importantly it officially exempted the church from any form of taxation by Mongol or Russian authorities and permitted clergymen to remain unregistered during censuses and clergy were furthermore not liable for forced labor or military service For the first time the Orthodox church would become less dependent on princely powers than in any other period of Russian history

From 1771 to 1845 at least eight missions of the Russian Orthodox Church visited Mongolia The first Orthodox church on Mongolian territory Holy Trinity Church  was established in Khalkhas capital city Urga in 1872 and newly rebuilt there in 2007

Western Catholicism was first introduced in medieval times primarily through Franciscan and Dominican missionaries sent to the Mongol court in Karakorum and also via medieval Roman Catholic missions in China Missionaries to China were successful during the Mongolcreated Yuan Dynasty in China in the late 13thearly 14th centuries However after the native Chinese Ming Dynasty overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 Christians were expelled from China Many Mongols in the western part of the Empire converted to Islam and with the collapse of the entire Mongol Empire in the 14th century Christianity nearly disappeared from Central Asia only reappearing after the Second Opium War in the mid19th century In time a mission was founded for Outer Mongolia giving Mongolia its first Roman Catholic jurisdiction but all work ceased within a year when a communist regime came to power and freedom of thought and religion were no longer permitted

With the introduction of democracy in 1990 Roman Catholic missionaries returned and rebuilt the church from scratch As of 2006 there is an Apostolic Prefecture a bishop three churches and diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Mongolia since 1992 Pope John Paul II originally planned to visit Mongolia along with Kazan but he eventually cancelled the trip supposedly explaining to a Russian newspaper that Our Lord does not want it By 2014 there were 919 Catholics in the Prefecture Apostolic of Ulaanbaatar headed by Wenceslao Selga Padilla CICM as Prefect and organized into 6 parishes

Most Christians in Mongolia today are Protestant and most have become Christians since Mongolias transition to democracy in the early 1990s Mongolia has a local Christian TV station Eagle Television and a proChristian radio station Family Radio

In 1992 6 LDS couples arrived in Mongolia as English teachers In 1995 the Mongolia Ulaanbaatar Mission was established with Richard Cook as the first mission president The Ulaanbaatar Mongolia West Stake with 6 congregations was formed in 2009 growing to 9 congregations by May 2016 The Ulaanbaatar Mongolia East Stake was created in May 2016 with 6 congregations About 2010 new visa laws went into effect limiting foreigners causing many of the foreign LDS missionaries to be reassigned to other countries There were however about 110 Mongolian missionaries serving full time missions inside Mongolia By the end of 2015 the LDS Church had 11250 members in 23 congregations

Information Technology Act 2000
The Information Technology Act 2000 also known as ITA2000 or the IT Act is an Act of the Indian Parliament No 21 of 2000 notified on 17 October 2000 It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce It is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration recommended by the General Assembly of United Nations by a resolution dated 30 January 1997

The bill was passed in the budget session of 2000 and signed by President K R Narayanan on 9 May 2000 The bill was finalised by group of officials headed by then Minister of Information Technology Pramod Mahajan

The original Act contained 94 sections divided into 13 chapters and 4 schedules The laws apply to the whole of India Persons of other nationalities can also be indicted under the law if the crime involves a computer or network located in India

The Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures It also defines cyber crimes and prescribes penalties for them The Act directed the formation of a Controller of Certifying Authorities to regulate the issuance of digital signatures It also established a Cyber Appellate Tribunal to resolve disputes rising from this new law The Act also amended various sections of the Indian Penal Code 1860 the Indian Evidence Act 1872 the Bankers Book Evidence Act 1891 and the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 to make them compliant with new technologies

A major amendment was made in 2008 It introduced Section 66A which penalized sending of offensive messages It also introduced Section 69 which gave authorities the power of interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource It also introduced provisions addressing child porn cyber terrorism and voyeurism The amendment was passed on 22 December 2008 without any debate in Lok Sabha The next day it was passed by the Rajya Sabha It was signed into law by President Pratibha Patil on 5 February 2009

List of offences and the corresponding penalties



From its establishment as an amendment to the original act in 2008 Section 66A attracted controversy over its unconstitutional nature

In December 2012 P Rajeev a Rajya Sabha member from Kerala tried to pass a resolution seeking to amend the Section 66A He was supported by D Bandyopadhyay Gyan Prakash Pilania Basavaraj Patil Sedam Narendra Kumar Kashyap Rama Chandra Khuntia and Baishnab Charan Parida P Rajeev pointed that cartoons and editorials allowed in traditional media were being censored in the new media He also said that law was barely debated before being passed in December 2008

Rajeev Chandrasekhar suggested the 66A should only apply to person to person communication pointing to a similar section under the Indian Post Office Act 1898 Shantaram Naik opposed any changes saying that the misuse of law was sufficient to warrant changes Then Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal defended the existing law saying that similar laws existed in US and UK He also said that a similar provision existed under Indian Post Office Act 1898 However P Rajeev said that the UK dealt only with communication from person to person

In November 2012 IPS officer Amitabh Thakur and his wife social activist Nutan Thakur filed a petition in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court claiming that the Section 66A violated the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Article 191a of the Constitution of India They said that the section was vague and frequently misused

Also in November 2012 a Delhibased law student Shreya Singhal filed a Public Interest Litigation PIL in the Supreme Court of India She argued that the Section 66A was vaguely phrased as result it violated Article 14 19 1a and Article 21 of the Constitution The PIL was accepted on 29 November 2012 A similar petition was also filed by the founder of MouthShutcom Faisal Farooqui and NGO Common Cause represented by Prashant Bhushan
In August 2014 the Supreme Court asked the central government to respond to petitions filed by Mouthshutcom and later petition filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India IAMAI which claimed that the IT Act gave the government power to arbitrarily remove usergenerated content

On 24 March 2015 the Supreme Court of India gave the verdict that Section 66A is unconstitutional in entirety The court said that Section 66A of IT Act 2000 is arbitrarily excessively and disproportionately invades the right of free speech provided under Article 191 of the Constitution of India But the Court turned down a plea to strike down sections 69A and 79 of the Act which deal with the procedure and safeguards for blocking certain websites 

The data privacy rules introduced in the Act in 2011 have been described as too strict by some Indian and US firms The rules require firms to obtain written permission from customers before collecting and using their personal data This has affected US firms which outsource to Indian companies However some companies have welcomed the strict rules saying it will remove fears of outsourcing to Indian companies

The Section 69 allows intercepting any information and ask for information decryption To refuse decryption is an offence The Indian Telegraph Act 1885 allows the government to tap phones But according to a 1996 Supreme Court verdict the government can tap phones only in case of a public emergency But there is no such restriction on Section 69 On 20 December 2018 the Ministry of Home Affairs cited Section 69 in the issue of an order authorising ten central agencies to intercept monitor and decrypt any information generated transmitted received or stored in any computer While some claim this to be a violation of the fundamental right to privacy the Ministry of Home Affairs has claimed its validity on the grounds of national security 

On 2 April 2015 the Chief Minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis revealed to the state assembly that a new law was being framed to replace the repealed Section 66A Fadnavis was replying to a query Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe Gorhe had said that repeal of the law would encourage online miscreants and asked whether the state government would frame a law to this regard Fadnavis said that the previous law had resulted in no convictions so the law would be framed such that it would be strong and result in convictions

On 13 April 2015 it announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs would form a committee of officials from the Intelligence Bureau Central Bureau of Investigation National Investigation Agency Delhi Police and ministry itself to produce a new legal framework This step was reportedly taken after complaints from intelligence agencies that they were no longer able to counter online posts that involved national security matter or incite people to commit an offence such as online recruitment for ISIS Former Minister of State with the Ministry of Information Technology Milind Deora has supported a new unambiguous section to replace 66A

Hes So Fine
Hes So Fine is a song written by Ronald Mack It was recorded by The Chiffons who topped the Billboard Hot 100 for four weeks in the spring of 1963 One of the most instantly recognizable Golden Oldies with its doolang doolang doolang background vocal Hes So Fine is also renowned as the plaintiff song in the nowinfamous plagiarism case against George Harrisons My Sweet Lord

Country music singer Jody Miller scored a topten hit of her own in 1971 with her cover of Hes So Fine

Hes So Fine was written by Ronald Mack an acquaintance of the Chiffons members who set himself up as their manager after overhearing them harmonise in their high schools lunch room Mack elicited the interest of Bright Tunes Corporation a production company run by the Tokens who produced the Chiffons singing Hes So Fine and two other Mack compositions at Capitol Recording Studios

The Tokens themselves  who had never previously played on a recording session  provided the instrumentation with the services of drummer Gary Chester

Originally one of the two other songs Oh My Lover was considered the potential hit But the completed track for Hes So Fine with its nowclassic Doolang doolang doolang background vocal  the suggestion of the sessions sound engineer Johnny Cue  seemed an obvious smash However Capitol Records for whom the Tokens were house producers rejected the track Jay Siegal of the Tokens recalled Capitols president Voyle Gilmore dismissing the track as too tritetoo simple The Tokens shopped Hes So Fine to ten labels before placing it with Laurie Records According to Siegal We played it and they locked the doors and said Youre not getting out of here We want that recordOf course wed already been turned down by ten companies Give us eighty cents and wed have given you the record

The Chiffons two later Top 10 hits both contain echoes of Hes So Fine although neither song was written by Ronald Mack who died soon after the Chiffons had recorded his song One Fine Day was written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and Sweet Talking Guy  in which the background vocalists sing hes so fine  was cowritten by the cofounder of Laurie Records Eliot Greenberg

The suit to determine damages was scheduled for November 1976 but delayed until February 1981 by which time Allen Klein Harrisons onetime manager who had been his legal adviser in the first phase of the suit had become the plaintiff by virtue of purchasing Bright Tunes The final decision was that Harrison himself would purchase Bright Tunes from Klein for 587000the amount Klein had paid for the corporationand although litigation continued for at least ten more years that decision was upheld In 1975 the Chiffons would record a version of My Sweet Lord attempting to capitalize on the publicity generated by the lawsuit Harrisons This Song was written in reaction to the plagiarism suit

Puyuhuapi volcanic group
Puyuhuapi Volcanic Group is a volcanic group of cinder cones located at the head of Puyuhuapi Channel in the Aysn del General Carlos Ibez del Campo Region of Chile

Puyuhuapi is one of the volcanoes in the southern segment of the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone which includes a number of stratovolcanoes South of this southern segment a gap without volcanic activity separates the Southern Volcanic Zone from the Austral Volcanic Zone

The volcanic field extends from the western side of the channel north over the head of the channel towards Lake Risopatrn with one isolated cone found on the eastern side of the channel The town of Puyuhuapi is located approximately halfway through the field The cones on the western side are a separate group from the ones towards the north and associated with two different eruption fissures but both fissures are associated with the LiquieOfqui fault zone The basement on which the field is built is formed by rocks of the Patagonian Batholith

The field is formed by cinder cones while the isolated centre is formed by a fissure fed lava flow The southernmost cone is also the largest with a diametre of and features a high secondary cone nested within its wide summit crater The eruption fissures also generated lava flows the cones formed afterwards over the fissures On the northern end of the Puyuhuapi channel the eruptions filled part of the channel and separated Lake Risopatrn from it this activity may have been phreatomagmatic in nature Two edifices have a volume of and respectively

The cones were constructed by basaltic andesite which contains clinopyroxene olivine and plagioclase The petrologically primitive composition suggests that they were constructed from primitive asthenosphere derived magmas that reached the surface directly through the LiquieOfqui fault system 

The cones may be extremely young one eruption with a volume of about may have occurred about 9000 years ago based on stratigraphy although the date is fairly uncertain The glacial isostasy phenomena at the end of the last ice age may have triggered the magma ascent and thus eruptions
