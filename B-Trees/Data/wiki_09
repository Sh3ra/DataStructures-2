David Foster novelist
David Manning Foster born 15 May 1944 is an Australian novelist and scientist He has written a range of satires on the theme of the decline of Western civilization as well as producing short stories poetry essays and a number of radio plays

David Manning Foster was born on 15 May 1944 in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales Australia to George and Hazel ne Manning Foster vaudeville and radio performers who separated before his birth and spent his early years in Katoomba raised by his mother and maternal grandparents In 1950 Foster spent six months in Katoomba Hospital recovering from poliomyelitis a disease that left him with a slight limp His mother married a bank officer and Foster attended high schools in Sydney Fort Street High School Armidale Armidale High School and Orange Orange High School as the family moved from city to country towns At Orange High Foster began playing drums professionally in a jazz dance band

In 1961 Foster commenced a Arts degree at the University of Sydney in Sydney but he left studies after a year to work and travel A year thereafter in 1963 he return to the University to study chemistry at the University of Sydney School of Chemistry

Foster worked parttime as a musician and as an engineer at Marrickville Council while he completed his Bachelor of Science in Chemistry He was awarded the University Medal for Inorganic Chemistry in 1967 and moved to Canberra for a PhD in Biological Inorganic Chemistry at the Australian National University from which he graduated in 1970

At the end of this degree he went to Philadelphia Pennsylvania in the United States to pursue postdoctoral studies at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Pennsylvania

During this time he began to write his first novellas later published in North South West 1973 Back in Sydney in 1972 he worked as a Research Officer in the Department of Medicine University of Sydney before abandoning science for a career as a novelist Since then he has supported himself and his family by various work as a pool attendant musician postman truck driver martial arts instructor and trawler fisherman After the publication of North South West by Macmillan Foster was awarded an Australia Council for the Arts Fellowship

Fosters first collection of novellas was wellreceived and his first novel The Pure Land 1974 won the inaugural The Age Book of the Year prize The novel is strongly autobiographical as it traces the experiences of the young scientist Danny Harris in America and Australia At the end of the novel Danny has abandoned science and appears to be inventing the novel in which he is a character His grandfather Albert Manwaring has left his life as a photographer in Katoomba to seek success and finally spiritual purity in America Danny born in America reverses the journey to find a Pure Land in Australia The novel satirises both the grasping materialism of America and the backward colonialism of Australia This novel was followed by another collection of stories Escape to Reality 1977 which pursued Fosters interest in masculine irresponsibility and the paradoxes of science and art With a fellow scientist at the Australian National University called DK Lyall Des Kirk Foster published The Empathy Experiment 1977 a strange exploration of paranoia in the context of scientific experiments in empathy

A 1978 Marten Bequest enabled Foster to travel to Scotland to research Moonlite 1981 his acclaimed satire on colonialism which places the experiences of Scottish islanders during the clearances of the nineteenth century in paradoxical comparison with the colonising of Australia at the same time Plumbum 1983 uses Fosters experience in jazz bands to satirise the contemporary Western adulation of rock musicians contrasting this fervour with the various religions of Bangkok and India The Adventures of Christian Rosy Cross 1985 is a burlesque historical satire on the paradoxes of religious belief following the picaresque adventures of Christian as he searches for the philosophers stone Dog Rock a Postal Pastoral 1985 offers a more benign comedy as Foster examines the trivia of an Australian country town like Bundanoon A second Dog Rock novel The Pale Blue Crochet Coathanger Cover 1988 continues this nostalgic view of a disappearing rural life with particular reference to the misuse of animals and in 2012 Foster published a third Dog Rock novel Man of Letters Testostero 1987 inspired by a residence in Venice in 1984 uses the convention of the separated twins to satirise the cultural differences between Britain and Australia with a third possibility represented by Italy Among its many allusions and parodies the novel invokes the traditions of Carnivale and Carlo Goldonis playThe Venetian Twins

After the Australian Bicentennial celebrations of 1988 Foster published his own satire of the state of contemporary Australia in Mates of Mars 1991 The novel follows a group of martial arts enthusiasts as they travel from Sydney to the Northern Territory and encounter a spiritualism that challenges their various beliefs and attitudes The characters represent a multicultural Australia and demonstrate the novels premise that Australians are not just members of the internal proletariat ofWestern Christian Civilisation  a civilisation now decrepit that can never take Colonials seriously but also in certain key aspects chiefly but not exclusively economic barbarian members of the external proletariat of the Sinic Mahayana Buddhist Civilisation in its Westernised JapaneseKoreanColonial Chinese branch on the southernmost march of that civilisation

Foster used the support of an Australian government Creative Fellowship awarded in 1991 a Keating award to research his monumental The Glade Within the Grove 1996 Narrated by the postman of Dog Rock DArcy DOliveres this novel examines the destruction of the native forests of Australia and the decline of Christianity in the context of preChristian religious beliefs Set mainly in the revolutionary year of 1968 the novel speculates about a group of hippies who set up a commune in the South Eastern forests of Australia The novels accompanying poemThe Ballad of Erinungerah claims to be the work of a child of the commune and describes the visit of the goddess Brigid and her demand that the men castrate themselves The novel celebrates the forests in lyrical descriptions satirises the stupidity of the communards and translates snatches of classic texts into Australian vernacular It is celebratory satirical and elegiac Later Foster published under his own name an essay On Castration in Heat magazine that incorporated part of the novel as it argued that male sexuality is a destructive force that needs to be controlled This obsession is evident in all Fosters work after Mates of Mars His novel In the New Country offers a comic and despairing view of the decline of rural life in Australia comparing it to the corresponding decline of spirituality in the Old Country of Ireland The Land Where Stories End is a fairytale about a woodcutter in Ireland who goes on an impossible quest for spiritual purity 

In 2009 Foster published Sons of the Rumour his most ambitious and original novel to date Modelled on the structure of the One Thousand and One Nights it changes the storytellers role from Shahrazad to a group of men travelling through the 7th century city of Merv Richard Burtons Arabian Nights are transformed into Iranian days Foster creates a comic structure for the stories with his rather Australian bickering couple the Shah and Shahrazad but the stories are imaginative adventures sometimes puzzling sometimes grotesque and often wondrous For example The Mine in the Moon imagines a world without women where boys grow up without maternal comfort The Tears of the Fish describes an orgy and castration ritual The Gilt Felt Yurt measures the loss of freedom in the creation of civilization and settlement In the course of the stories the Shah undergoes an education in spiritualism and sexual understanding A final section of the novel moves to the present day where a modern man undergoes a visionary experience in Ireland Reviewing the novel for Australian Book Review James Ley concluded There is simply no one remotely like him in contemporary Australian fiction He is so far ahead of everyone else that its not funny Except that it is funnyvery very funny

In 1964 Foster married his Orange High girlfriend Robin Bowers with whom he would have three children Samantha b 1968 Natalie b 1969 and Seth b 1973

In 1974 he left his wife and family to live with Gerda Busch the singer in the Canberra jazz band where he played drums They moved to the country town of Bundanoon where they married and had three children Antigone b 1975 Levi b 1976 and Zoe Foster Blake b 1980 Foster worked as a postman at Bundanoon for many years and his Dog Rock novels provide a comic version of the town

His daughter Zoe is also a writer and is married to comedian Hamish Blake

Plcido de Castro Acre
Plcido de Castro is a municipality located in the east of the Brazilian state of Acre on the border with Bolivia

The municipal seat is on the left bank of the Abun River which defines the boundary between Brazil and Bolivia
It is from Rio Branco by road or as the crow flies accessible to weekend tourists from the city via the AC40 highway
It has an area of  and is the 19th largest in area in Acre
The municipality is bounded to the north and northwest by the municipality of Senador Guiomard to the east by the municipality of Acrelndia to the south by Bolivia and to the west by the municipality of Capixaba
The municipality contains the Plcido de Castro Ecological Park a municipal conservation area that contains 113 genera of trees
An area that held large trees such as Brazil nut rubber cocoa and mahogany was destroyed by fire in 2005

The surrounding area has several large ancient earthworks termed geoglifos by regional archaeologists
An example is clearly visible in aerial photography at 

In the early 20th century the region of the present municipality was a place where fugitives from the law took refuge
Jos Plcido de Castro who was prefect of the Alto Acre department in 190607 recommended the need for a settlement to stabilise the situation
In 1922 a trading post was established serving extractors of nuts and rubber in the Abun River basin
The post was in a rubber tappers settlement named Pacatuba on the So Gabriel rubber estate which was soon renamed after Plcido de Castro a hero of the Acre War

The Plcido de Castro District is shown as part of the Rio Branco municipality in the divisions of 31 December 1936 and 1 July 1960
The town did not develop until the 1940s and 1950s with the opening of the present road that links the city of Rio Branco to the towns of Quinari Senador Guiomard and Plcido de Castro
The municipality of Plcido de Castro was created on 10 March 1963

The 2010 census gave the population as 17209 of which 8999 were men and 8210 women 12384 were literate
6787 were Roman Catholic and 5134 were Evangelical Christians
The Human Development Index as of 2010 was 0622
In 2015 there were 3260 elementary school pupils and 776 secondary school pupils
Estimated population as of 2016 was 18159

The municipality is the 8th largest in Acre by population with a population density of 887 inhabitants per square kilometre
The local economy is based on beef and dairy cattle saw mills furniture manufacture tourism agriculture and extraction particularly Brazil nuts
The neighbouring Bolivian village of Vila Montevidu had a free trade zone for imported goods that was much visited by Brazilians
The village was burned in a major fire in 2007 and was rebuilt on a nearby site with the new name of Vila Evo Morales
The name honours President Evo Morales of Bolivia who sent aid for reconstruction and was the first Bolivian president to visit the village

Porto Acre
Porto Acre is a municipality located in the northeast of the Brazilian state of Acre 
The economy is mainly based on agriculture As of 2010 the municipality had a population of 14806

Porto Acre is in the eastern part of the state of Acre to the north of the BR364 highway and Rio Branco
The municipal seat is on the left west bank of the Acre River a tributary of the Purus River that runs through the municipality from south to north
The town can be accessed by boat along the Acre River or by land along the AC010 highway which runs north from Rio Branco for 
The distance from Rio Branco as the crow flies is 
Porto Acre is limited to the north by the state of Amazonas to the west and south by the municipality of Bujari to the south by Rio Branco and to the east by the municipality of Senador Guiomard

In 1899 Acre belonged to Bolivia and the present municipal seat was named Puerto Alonso
That year Luis Glvez Rodrguez de Arias expelled the Bolivians and declared the Independent State of Acre
He renamed Puerto Alonso to Cidade do Acre and made it the headquarters of the new state
The state created a flag minted its own currency drafted a constitution appointed ministers and formed an army
However Galves was deposed and arrested after a few months and the Bolivians regained control

At the start of 1902 Jos Plcido de Castro accepted an invitation to lead a revolt against Bolivia
He took a boat up the Acre river ostensibly to conduct land surveys in the south but in practice carrying arms and ammunition 
He stopped off briefly in Puerto Alonso to meet the Bolivian governor Lino Romero and evaluate his future opponent
In the south he organised the rubber tappers and other inhabitants for the revolt
He then returned to Brazil bypassing Puerto Alonso to avoid alerting the Bolivians

Plcido captured Xapuri on 6 August 1902 and next day proclaimed that Acre was independent
On 14 October 1902 the rebels captured some of the outer defences of Puerto Alonso and the armed Bolivian launch Rio Afua which they renamed the Independencia
Plcido de Castro surrounded the town on 8 January 1903 and launched an attack on 15 January 1903 that soon petered out
His men started to dig zigzag trenches to the Bolivian lines
Eventually with his forces exhausted and almost out of ammunition Romero surrendered on 24 January 1903

The municipality of Porto Acre gained autonomy on 28 April 1992 when it was separated from the Rio Branco municipality
The first mayor and councillors took office of 1 January 1993
According to the 2010 census the municipality has a population of 14806
The municipality has an area of and a population density of 571 inhabitants per square kilometre
The local football team is Valncia Porto Acre

Porto Acres economy is based on extraction of rubber Brazil nut and wood processing smallscale livestock horticultural products and general commerce
The Acre River is still used for movement of goods and people
During the dry season its fertile banks are used to grow watermelon banana vegetables cassava and other food crops
There are nine settlement projects with a total area of  or 441 of the municipal area

Australian Film Commission
The Australian Film Commission AFC was an Australian government agency with a mandate to promote the creation and distribution of films in Australia as well as to preserve the countrys film history It also had a production arm responsible for production and commissioning of films for the Australian Government It was established by the Whitlam Government in 1975 as the successor to the Australian Film Development Corporation set up by the Gorton Government The AFC had offices in Sydney Melbourne Canberra and Brisbane

The AFC was funded in part by the national government and in part from its return on investments in film production as well as interest on film development loans It financially assisted film and television production and also produced films generally intended for government purposes through its production arm Film Australiapreviously known as the Commonwealth Film Unit A Film Australia feature film for children Let the Balloon Go was released in 1976

Conditional event algebra
A conditional event algebra CEA is an algebraic structure whose domain consists of logical objects described by statements of forms such as If A then B B given A and B in case A Unlike the standard Boolean algebra of events a CEA allows the defining of a probability function P which satisfies the equation PIf A then B  PA and B  PA over a usefully broad range of conditions

In standard probability theory one begins with a set  of outcomes or in alternate terminology a set of possible worlds and a set F of some not necessarily all subsets of  such that F is closed under the countably infinite versions of the operations of basic set theory union  intersection  and complementation   A member of F is called an event or alternatively a proposition and F the set of events is the domain of the algebra  is necessarily a member of F namely the trivial event Some outcome occurs

A probability function P assigns to each member of F a real number in such a way as to satisfy the following axioms

It follows that PE is always less than or equal to 1 The probability function is the basis for statements like PA  B  073 which means The probability that A but not B is 73

The statement The probability that if A then B is 24 means put intuitively that event B occurs in 24 of the outcomes where event A occurs The standard formal expression of this is PBA  024 where the conditional probability PBA equals by definition PA  B  PA

It is tempting to write instead PA  B  024 where A  B is the conditional event If A then B That is given events A and B one might posit an event A  B such that PA  B could be counted on to equal PBA One benefit of being able to refer to conditional events would be the opportunity to nest conditional event descriptions within larger constructions Then for instance one could write PA  B  C  051 meaning The probability that either A or else if B then C is 51

Unfortunately philosopher David Lewis showed that in orthodox probability theory only certain trivial Boolean algebras with very few elements contain for any given A and B an event X such that PX  PBA is true for any probability function P Later extended by others this result stands as a major obstacle to any talk about logical objects that can be the bearers of conditional probabilities

The classification of an algebra makes no reference to the nature of the objects in the domain being entirely a matter of the formal behavior of the operations on the domain However investigation of the properties of an algebra often proceeds by assuming the objects to have a particular character Thus the canonical Boolean algebra is as described above an algebra of subsets of a universe set What Lewis in effect showed is what can and cannot be done with an algebra whose members behave like members of such a set of subsets

Conditional event algebras circumvent the obstacle identified by Lewis by using a nonstandard domain of objects Instead of being members of a set F of subsets of some universe set  the canonical objects are normally higherlevel constructions of members of F The most natural construction and historically the first uses ordered pairs of members of F Other constructions use sets of members of F or infinite sequences of members of F

Specific types of CEA include the following listed in order of discovery

CEAs differ in their formal properties so that they cannot be considered a single axiomatically characterized class of algebra GoodmanNguyenvan Frassen algebras for example are Boolean while Calabrese algebras are nondistributive The latter however support the intuitively appealing identity A  B  C  A  B  C while the former do not

Takeda Skaku
Born in the Aizu domain Fukushima Prefecture Skaku grew up in the time of the Boshin War The second son of Takeda Skichi a samurai of the Takeda clan who worked his farm and taught at a local school in a Buddhist temple His mother Tomi Kurokochi was a daughter of Dengoro Kurokochi a Yari and Kenjutsu master It is believed that Skaku received his first martial arts training from his father who had a dojo on their property
Skichi was apparently expert in the use of both sword and spear and had once been a sumo wrestler of ozeki rank It is believed that Skaku was exposed to the teachings of Hzinry Takadaha and Onoha Ittry schools of spear and swordsmanship respectively

Skaku then left to go on a period of austere training where he travelled fought and trained at the schools of many teachers a not uncommon practise of the time Reputedly Skaku spent some time as a livein student of Kenkichi Sakakibara headmaster of the Jikishinkagery and considered to be one of the most famous and skilled swordsmen of the era

With the outlawing of the samurai class and the prohibition against carrying swords Haitrei Edict apparentally Sokaku decided to emphasize the empty handed jujutsu oriented techniques of his ancestors art These apparently were oshikiuchi or secret teachings of the Aizu clan up to that point These along with other skills he had acquired were combined to create an art which he christened first Daitry jjutsu and later Daitry Aikijjutsu

In about 1875 rumor reached Skaku that Saig Takamori had launched his rebellion in Satsuma against the forces of the new Meiji government He decided immediately that he would go to lend his support He made it as far as Kyushu but was unable to reach his destination so he returned to Osaka where he spent the next ten years as a guest in the Kyshin Meichiry dojo of swordsman Momonoi Shunzo

Skaku lived a somewhat itinerant life travelling the length and breadth of the country giving seminars in martial arts to military officers police officers and martial arts enthusiasts often of high social standing He left extensive records of those he taught in his eimeiroku and shareikoku  attendance and fee ledgers

Taking over the role of headmaster of the art was Skakus son Tokimune Takeda who established the Daitokan school in Hokkaid to promote the art and rechristened it Daitry Aiki Bud Tokimune is said to have contributed much of the teaching system which exists for the art today naming and classifying the techniques and further simplifying the weapons component of the system He emphasized the Ona ha Ittoryu portion of the weapons curriculum over other elements that Skaku taught to some advanced students

Sokakus highest ranking students were Hisa Takuma and Masao Tonedate both high executives of the Asahi newspaper in Osaka whose own students established the Takumakai and the Daibukan

Other important students of Skakus were Yukiyoshi Sagawa who some believe was the most talented of his early students Kodo Horikawa Kotaro whose students established the Kodokai and the Roppokai Ktar Yoshida Hosaku Matsuda and Tomekichi Yamamoto

His most famous student was the founder of aikido Morihei Ueshiba and it is the popularity of this modern martial arts form that is responsible for much of the interest in Daitry today

Hosaku Matsuda was taught by Skaku who in turn taught Yoshiji Okuyama who in turn founded the Hakkry Jujutsu school Okuyama taught Michiomi Nakano who later as Dshin S founder of Nippon Shorinji Kempo Choi YongSool the founder of Hapkido was adopted by Sokaku and trained with him as well

The influence of the teachings of Sokaku Takeda are readily discernible in the physical techniques of aikido Hakko Ryu Nippon Shorinji Kempo hapkido and judos goshin jutsu selfdefense kata via Kenji Tomiki today

Humanistic coefficient
A humanistic coefficient  is a conceptual object methodological principle or method of conducting social research wherein data analysis stresses the perceived import of analyzed experiences to their participants The term was coined by Polish sociologist Florian Znaniecki

Znaniecki coined the term in Polish in his Wstp do socjologii Introduction to Sociology 1922 and translated it into English as humanistic coefficient in his book The ObjectMatter of Sociology 1927

Grossly and simply speaking the humanistic coefficient is the difference between trying to describe or explain social facts as if they were purely physical phenomena or doing it instead by taking into account the culture of the folk or milieu in which those facts happen

In Znanieckis own words an observer of cultural life can understand the data observed only if taken with the humanistic coefficient only if he does not limit his observation to his own direct experience of the data but reconstructs the experience and the data in the social context of the people involved Elsewhere he wrote This essential character of cultural data we call the humanistic coefficient because such data as objects of the students theoretic reflection already belong to somebodys elses experience and are such as this active experience makes them

Piotr Sztompka defines the humanistic coefficient as a connection that exists between each social fact and actions and experiences of particular individuals and the resulting need for those facts to be studied from specific perspective that requires the research to place him or herself in the position of those individuals Elbieta Haas in turn defines it as the notion of the human collectives constructing and reconstructing of reality thus related to the concept of social constructionist

According to the concept of the humanistic coefficient all social facts are created by social actors and can only be understood from their perspective No social facts can exist without connection to some individuals although that connection does not have to necessarily be consciously perceived Thus the sociologist should study reality by trying to understand how others see the world not as an independent observer objectively in other words the scientist needs to understand the world of the subject Ken Plummer puts it curtly as the object of study is always linked to somebodys human meanings

While some have criticized the humanistic coefficient approach as too close to subjectivism Znaniecki himself saw is as antisubjectivist he noted that social facts like cultural systems can exist even if nobody perceives their existence He was also critical of any value coming from personal subjective observations arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described Both natural and social sciences operate within the bounds of the humanistic coefficient but the natural sciences may abstract the pheomena they analyze from it while the social sciences are methodologically obliged to account for it Thus Znaniecki argued that the difference between natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences but in the subject of what is being studied for Znaniecki natural sciences studied things and social sciences  cultural values He saw sociology as a nomothetic science that should be able to use a similar methodology as natural sciences

The humanistic coefficient concerns the ontology of culture but it also has an epistemological aspect as it describes how sociological concepts should be constructed in an environment where social facts investigated by the researchers can be accessed only through experiences and actions of the subjects he or she observes

The humanistic coefficient is a major element in the sociological theory of Znaniecki

Xapuri
Xapuri  is a municipality located in the southeast of the Brazilian state of Acre 
It was the scene of an early bloodless victory during the war to make Acre independent of Bolivia The town is known as the birthplace of the rubber tapper Dr Adib Domingos Jatene and the environmentalist Chico Mendes

Xapuri is at the point where the Xapuri River meets the Acre River
Its name is said to come from the Indian word Chapury meaning river meeting
Another explanation is that its name comes from the indigenous tribe of Xapury people
The town is about northwest of the BR317 highway which leads from Rio Branco to the east to Brasilia to the west It has broad streets and wooden houses
The area of the municipality is 
It is 12th largest in area in Acre
It is bounded by the municipality of Sena Madureira to the west Rio Branco to the north Capixaba to the east Epitaciolndia to the south and Brasilia to the southwest

The municipality contains part of the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve a sustainable use environmental unit created in 1990
The reserve is fairly well maintained apart from a few locations of deforestation but its surroundings are quite deforested compromising its buffer zone

Xapuri was born in 1883 shortly after Volta da Empreza todays Rio Branco was founded
The first Europeans came to the region in the first rubber boom a period of uncontrolled land grabbing and extraction of forest resources
The village of Xapuri became one of Acres main rubber trading posts and the region was an important producer of rubber and Brazil nuts
Until the Acre War of 190203 it was part of Bolivia although most of the new colonists were Brazilian
At the time of the Acre War the Bolivians called the post Mariscal Sucre

At the start of 1902 Jos Plcido de Castro accepted an invitation to lead a revolt against Bolivia
Although he argued for immediately attacking the garrison of 230 troops at Puerto Alonso now Porto Acre Plcido de Castro was persuaded to first take the outpost at Xapuri
He entered Xapuri with 33 men in the early morning of 6 August 1902 and captured the sleeping garrison without spilling blood
On 7 August 1902 he issued a manifesto proclaiming that Acre was independent
After further fighting the last Bolivian forces surrender at what is now Porto Acre on 24 January 1903

The village of Xapuri was officially elevated to the status of a town on 22 March 1904 by the prefect of Alto Acre Colonel Augusto da Cunha Matos
On 22 March 1905 it was elevated to the status of city by the interim prefect Captain Odilon Pratagi Brasiliense
Xapuri was officially made a municipality on 23 October 1912
Infrastructure was soon built including trading houses and schools
For many years Xapuri was known as the Little Princess of Acre Princesinha do Acre due to its great wealth from rubber

The city became famous after the 1988 assassination of the rubber tapper and environmentalist Chico Mendes who was born in Xapuri
His house has been preserved as one of the attractions of the town

The municipality of Xapuri has the 9th largest population in Acre
As of 2010 the population was 16091
The estimated population in 2016 was 17608
The population density of 2010 was 301 people per square kilometre

The town is an important Acre tourist destination for its monuments to the Acre War and the house of Chico Mendes and has an ecolodge at the Seringal Waterfall 
Apart from cattle ranching and subsistence farming there is a condom factory wood flooring factory and furniture workshops
There are several settlement projects for extraction of nuts and rubber subsistence agriculture and forestry
The people also raise livestock hunt and fish
The Xapuri I and II projects are trying to bring back extractors and farmers who had moved to the city and to promote recovery of areas of pasturage and slashandburn agriculture by replanting fruit trees and timber trees

Highpower field
A highpower field HPF when used in relation to microscopy references the area visible under the maximum magnification power of the objective being used Often this represents a 400fold magnification when referenced in scientific papers

The area provides a reference unit for example in reference ranges for urine tests

Used for grading of soft tissue tumors Grading usually on a scale of I to III is based
on the degree of differentiation the average number of
mitoses per highpower field cellularity pleomorphism

Volkspele
Volkspele is a South African folk dance tradition

Directly translated Volkspele means folkgames and can be translated to folkdance Folkdance was the brainchild of South African Dr SH Pellisier who was visiting Sweden in 1915 with a friend to become more proficient in carpentry After finishing their days work they met with other young people in their respective countries national dress to practise their folksinging and dancing The South Africans were the only ones left out as they did not have any traditional dances

Back in South Africa Pellisier translated four Swedish dances and taught them to pupils at the Afrikaans High School in Boshof where he was Deputy Headmaster During a Sunday School picnic on the farm Vuisfontein near Boshof on 22 February 1914 they performed the dances for the first time The picnic games became known as volkspele

With the help of the Reddingsdaadbond an organisation which was established to assist poor Afrikaners after the Anglo Boer War groups of dancers called laers were established throughout the country

Gettogethers called saamtrekke are usually organised where all the laers get together to sing and do folkdancing The folkdancers also present displays and have courses on different levels seniors people out of school and juniors learners in school for either a weekend or longer During the June school holidays there are also courses for grade 57 pupils known as the Judith Pellissierweek  named after the wife of Dr Pellissier grade 89 pupils known as the Vormingsweek  Formative and for grade 1012 pupils known as the Pellisierweek From time to time there are overseas tours or a folkdance group or two will tour with South African folkdancers in South Africa giving displays at various towns At these saamtrekke displays tours and courses the dress volkspeledrag is as the photos below show

Tours have been conducted to Europe Namibia The United States and Turkey with groups from Italy Germany Belgium and others touring South Africa

The dress originated from the formal dress the pioneers or Voortrekkers wore It is called national dress as in the European countries All folkdancers in South Africa must use the same style with only the colours differing Each laer has its own colours for the ladies dresses as well as for the mens waistcoats  these are embroidered with indigenous flower designs

Goldies theorem
In mathematics Goldies theorem is a basic structural result in ring theory proved by Alfred Goldie during the 1950s What is now termed a right Goldie ring is a ring R that has finite uniform dimension finite rank as a right module over itself and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of subsets of R 

Goldies theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients The structure of this ring of quotients is then completely determined by the ArtinWedderburn theorem

In particular Goldies theorem applies to semiprime right Noetherian rings since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on all right ideals This is sufficient to guarantee that a rightNoetherian ring is right Goldie The converse does not hold every right Ore domain is a right Goldie domain and hence so is every commutative integral domain

A consequence of Goldies theorem again due to Goldie is that every semiprime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of prime principal right ideal rings Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a right Ore domain

Khao Phing Kan
Khao Phing Kan   or Ko Khao Phing Kan   is an island in Thailand in Phang Nga Bay northeast of Phuket The islands are limestone karst towers and are a part of Ao Phang Nga National Park

About from the shores of Khao Phing Kan lies a tall islet called Ko Ta Pu   or Ko Tapu   Since 1974 when they were featured in the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun Khao Phing Kan and Ko Ta Pu have been popularly called James Bond Island

Khao Phing Kan means hills leaning against each other in Thai reflecting the connected nature of the islands Ko Ta Pu can be literally translated as crabs eye island and Ko Tapu can be translated as nail or spike island reflecting its shape With ko  meaning island and khao  meaning hill the terms ko khao and Ko Khao are frequently interchanged in the naming of the islands After appearing in the 1974 James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun Khao Phing Kan and sometimes Ko Ta Pu became widely referred to as James Bond Island especially in tourist guides and their original names are rarely used by locals

Before 1974 the island was a rarely visited indigenous area However it was chosen as one of the locations for the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun as the hideout for Bonds antagonist Francisco Scaramanga After the movie release it turned into a popular tourist destination Popularity and increased tourism left Khao Phing Kan with substantial litter

In 1981 the island became the most famous part of the newly established Ao Phang Nga Marine National Park Since 1998 it is forbidden for tourist boats to approach Ko Ta Pu This measure aims to stop erosion of the limestone rocks on and near the islet that might eventually result in the islands collapse

Khao Phing Kan consists of two forestcovered islands with steep shores They lie in the northwestern part of Phang Nga Bay from the mainland amid a group of a dozen of other islands Its western part is about in diameter whereas the eastern part is about long and wide and is elongated northwards The island has a few caves and two sandy beaches in the southwest and between the twin islands The former hosts the government office where every visitor has to pay a tax The latter is used as the port for the tourist boats arriving from the mainland and has several souvenir shops selling items like coral and shells and plasticencased butterflies scorpions and spiders Beaches and caves are regularly flooded with the tides which have an amplitude of  so access to some caves is only possible during low tide The Thai name for Khao Phing Kan reflects the particular shape of the island which appears as if a flat limestone cliff tumbled sideways and leaned on a similar rock in the centre of the island

Waters around the island are only few metres deep and are palegreen in colour The bottom is covered with silt brought to the Phang Nga Bay by several rivers from the north

Ko Ta Pu is a limestone rock about tall with the diameter increasing from about near the water level to about at the top It lies about to the west from the northern part of Khao Phing Kan

A local legend explains the formation of Ko Ta Pu as follows Once upon a time there lived a fisherman who used to bring home many fish every time he went to the sea However one day he could not catch any fish despite many attempts and only picked up a nail with his net He kept throwing the nail back into the sea and catching it again Furious he took his sword and cut the nail in half with all his strength Upon impact one half of the nail jumped up and speared into the sea forming Ko Ta Pu

A scientific version of the Ko Ta Pu formation says that in the Permian period the area was a barrier reef Then upon tectonic movements it ruptured and its parts were dispersed over the area and flooded by the rising ocean Wind waves water currents and tides gradually eroded the islands thus formed sometimes producing peculiar shapes such as Ko Ta Pu Tiderelated erosion is visible at the bottom
of the rock

In the James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun Francisco Scaramanga describes Ko Ta Pu as a mushroomshaped rock which houses two large solar panels that come up on top of Ko Ta Pu and lock on to the Sun

Ko Ta Pu is also featured in another James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies identified as in Vietnam and in the Italian film Quo Vado identified as in the Philippines

AiFak
AiFak  is a 2004 Thai drama film It is based on the SEA Write Awardwinning novel by Chart Korbjitti Khamphiphaksa The Judgment also the Englishlanguage title for the film

A young man Fak is a revered novice Buddhist monk and the entire village has turned out to the local temple to hear him preach a sermon Faks talk is interrupted a coughing fit by his widower father though and Fak struggles to maintain his focus Fak then decides he must put aside his aspirations for monkhood to take care of his father Then he is conscripted by lottery into the army He hopes that when he completes his national service he will return to the village be ordained as a monk and devote his life to religion

On his return home from the army the bus to his village breaks down During the stop Fak steps over to the side of the road near a lotus pond to urinate There among the lotus he sees a beautiful woman bathing fully clothed as is customary in Thailand Fak zips up and eventually arrives at home where he finds his father in a very happy state His fathers reason for being so happy is that he has remarried Faks stepmother then appears from behind a mosquito net its the woman from the lotus pond Her name is Somsong and though she is sweet and devoted there is something clearly wrong with her perhaps some type of mental illness

Though there are happy times with Fak joining his father at work as a janitor for the local school his reunion with his father is shortlived after his father becomes ill and dies Because Fak made a promise to his father that he would look after his stepmother Faks goal of returning to the monkhood must again be put aside

Though Fak is well liked in the village the villagers do not like Somsong and have labeled her crazy And after Faks fathers death the villagers start to treat Fak differently they believe he is having an affair with his stepmother Fak at first ignores the gossip but it becomes harder and harder to deny because of Somsongs behavior On one occasion during a likay performance at a village fair Fak is accosted by Somsong after she sees Fak talking with a young woman Somsong is suffering from delusions that she and Fak are married and she is jealous Somsong also has the unfortunate habit of shedding her clothes and running naked in public or simply lifting her dress and exposing herself During one of these episodes some villagers happen upon Fak just as hes chased the nude Somsong down and is attempting to cover her up But what the villagers think they are witnessing is Fak having sex with his stepmother Fak has been judged

Fak has taken his fathers old job as school janitor One day a dog thats thought to be rabid wanders onto the school grounds Fak is given the job of killing it He grabs a hoe and uses it to strike the animal hitting it with a glancing blow that only injures it and makes it angrier Fak eventually finishes the snarling dog off but it is a bloody task For a brief moment Fak is seen as a hero by the students and faculty and he feels a bit better about himself

Fak must prepare for his fathers cremation He invites the schools headmaster the village headman and others He orders 50 sandalwood blossoms for attendees to place on the burning casket But no one shows up for the ceremony except for the monks he engaged to chant over his father and the local undertaker

Fak makes friends with the undertaker a lowly person who is not well liked by the superstitious villagers because they believe he is unclean Even Fak didnt particularly like the man but after Fak tells him that he has never had sexual relations with Somsong the man believes him

After the cremation rite the undertaker offers Fak some rice whiskey Fak at first doesnt like the taste or the way it makes him feel But he has a few more drinks and starts enjoy himself Looking for relief from the pressure of taking care of his mentally ill stepmother and the harsh judgment of the villagers Fak turns to the bottle and becomes an alcoholic His downward spiral continues until he has angered the villagers and they turn on him and beat him leaving him to be assisted home by Somsong

Defending champion and number two seed John Part suffered a surprise third round defeat to Mark Dudbridge his first match of the 2004 campaign

The final became only the second ever and first PDC world final to go to a sudden death leg The first time it happened was when Phil Taylor beat Mike Gregory in the 1992 final Taylor was again involved and came out victorious against Kevin Painter However he had to fight from 41 down to win his 11th world title

The two losing semifinalists came from different ends of darts experience Fiftysixyearold Bob Anderson a World Champion 16 years earlier lost to Painter and Wayne Mardle was making his first PDC World Championship semifinal appearance Mardle lost to Taylor for the second year running following a third round defeat as an unseeded player in 2003

To accommodate the change in the number of entries into the competition to 48 the format of the World Championship was again changed 16 qualifiers would contest the first round with the eight winners going through to the second round to meet players ranked between 25 and 32 inclusive in the PDC These eight winners would go through to join the top 24 in the third round where the tournament proceeded from the last 32 to the Final

All eight first round matches would take place on the first day of the tournament as it opened up in Purfleet In the openIng match Richie Buckle showed excellent form in eliminated Jan van der Rassel 31 with an 8715 average Van der Rassel a tough competitor lost two sets by 32 so it could have been a totally different story Next man through was Erik Clarys a Belgian known for success at Lakeside he dispatched Dan Lauby 30 Lauby only averaging 63 and able to win two legs in the contest  In the afternoon there were also wins for Wayne Atwood 30 and Colin McGarry 30 over Toru Sano and Rory Orvis respectively

Arguably the best match of the first round came in the opening game in the evening Robbie Widdows known for his performances in the BDO played Henry ONeill in a five set thriller ONeill taking the fourth 32 and holding Widdows to 44 in the decider Experience told and Robbie took the final two legs to sneak through 64 in the final set Englands Simon Whatley the next man for Widdows

To follow that up we saw a superb recovery from Scotlands Alex Mackay against Barry Jouannet of Australia Jouannet dominating proceedings took the first two sets 32 31 to go twonil up McKay replied with two 31 sets of his own to level the match up at 22 and to go favourite Jouannet recovered from the setback however to go 22 in the decider and into the tiebreak However Mackays 8538 average would be enough to get him through 32 To finish the day Steve Smith and Steve Maish would go through beating Norman Madhoo Guyanas first ever dart qualifier 31 and Tony Payne known for his Embassy attempts 30 respectively

Players ranked 2532 in the World rankings came into play as the tournament began its second round Matches were still over best of 5 sets The afternoon session brought a succession of 30 scorelines for the qualifiers from yesterday Richie Buckle defeated Steve Brown and lost just four legs against the man who had been in the SemiFinals here a decade earlier Colin McGarry knocked out Mark Holden who would throw his darts away and retire after this 30 loss however Holden was suffering from Dartitis Wayne Atwood was at his best in eliminating Mick Manning 30 Manning lost the first two sets 30 before putting up resistance in the third set before losing it 32 Atwood averaged 8793 and moves into a match against two time finalist and number 3 seed Peter Manley in the third round The final match saw Mark Walsh knocked out 30 by Erik Clarys

The evening session followed the form book more however there was the prospect of lightning striking twice in the same place Alex McKay again recovered from behind to level the match at 22 with Lionel Sams The match of the round it proved to be as the pair served up a memorable contest Each of the opening 4 sets went 32 making the tiebreak inevitable Sams edged the fifth set by five legs to three to go through with an 8583 average Following this he proposed to his girlfriend Caroline live on Sky

Mark Dudbridge would go through 30 against Steven Smith however this didnt tell the full story as Smith took five legs and Mark took two deciding legs to go 20 up and the third by 31 to book his date against John Part the defending champion in the third round Simon Whatley would start off a great week for him in a 31 win over Robbie Widdows who didnt score as heavily as he had in the first round In the final match Big Cliff Lazarenko went out 31 to Steve Maish

7 third round matches as the top players entered the fray Matches had now been extended to the best of 7 sets so the players require 4 sets to go through

The 1st match saw to players with an excellent pedigree in the World Championship and not for the first time a tremendous fightback Dave Askew SemiFinalist in 2001 and 2002 took a 31 lead against Keith Deller However the 1983 world champion Deller fought back taking six of the next seven legs to level the match at 33 and set up a deciding set  Deller took it in the tiebreak winning the set 53 to go through However both players played short of the best and Deller could qualify with a 76 average The second match saw the number 3 seed Peter Manley pushed the entire way by Wayne Atwood Atwood led 10 21 and 32 in sets and was at one stage just one leg away from victory before Manley sneaked the sixth set 32 Experience began to tell and Manley qualified with a 31 set victory in the decider A 170 finish from Manley helping the 3rd seeds cause The final match of the afternoon saw the number 6 seed Dennis Smith go through 42 over Les Fitton however Fitton pushed the final set to the deciding leg having the chance to go to the seventh set but Smith would go through

Four matches took place in the evening in the first Erik Clarys run came to an end The 2 time former world championship finalist Ronnie Baxter taking the match 42 however Clarys had levelled up at 22 from 20 behind A 170 finish from Baxter began to put the pressure back on the Belgian as the match concluded Then Bob Anderson 16 years after his first world title began his push for a second title In tremendous form he took the first three sets losing just three legs in the process to go 30 up on the 11th seed Andy Jenkins Jenkins took the fourth set 31 and got to 22 in the fifth before Anderson prevailed to book his place in the fourth round with an 8469 average

The big shock of the day and the entire event so far came in the third match of the evening John Parts reign as Champion would come to an end as he lost 43 to Mark Dudbridge Dudbridge took the first two sets 32 and 31 to open up a 20 lead Part responded by showing glimpses of the form that beat Taylor a year ago to level the match up at 22 However Dudbridged nicked the fifth set by 32 to go 32 up and 1 leg away from the match Part again responded taking the sixth set 31 to level the match at 3 sets apiece

The seventh set went into the tiebreak when the pair became locked at 22 in legs 22 became 33 as the 2nd seed tried desperately to hold onto his crown However Dudbridge would take the next two legs to decide the match as he went through to the fourth round The drama of this match probably meant that another thriller was overlooked in Kevin Painters 43 win over Paul Williams Painter had gone 31 up playing great darts however Williams had levelled up at 33 Painter would take the decider 31 to go through to the fourth round with an 8862 average

Seven more matches as the third round continued at the Circus Tavern In the opening game of the afternoon session Steve Beaton the 1996 BDO World Champion knocked out Jamie Harvey 40 However 40 was a rough scoreline on Harvey as Beaton took each set bar the opening set in deciding legs to break Bravedarts heart and go through The next surprise in the World Championship came in the shape of the 1995 BDO World Champion Richie Burnett going out 43 to Simon Whatley Whatley holding his nerve in a tense sudden death leg taking the final set 65 to knock out the 13th seed Whatley now would face Roland Scholten or Lionel Sams in the fourth round The final match of the afternoon would see the first of the home players in action Colin Lloyd seeded 5 averaged 9861 to go through 41 against Peter Evison Lloyd had been particularly clinical Evison taking the opening set 32 but Lloyd would take the remaining four with the loss of just one leg

In the evening session Steve Maish would go out to the other local hero Dagenhams number 12 seed Wayne Mardle by four sets to two Mardle who pushed Taylor to eight sets in their third round classic a year ago would take the final two sets after Maish had held his own Mardle would now face Lloyd for a place in the quarterfinals Then followed arguably the biggest surprise of the day Roland Scholten would bow out 42 to Lionel Sams Sams however would be relieved to hold on after squandering a 3 set lead and managing to take the 6 set by 31 Had Scholten managed to level at 33 then surely he would have been favourite to win the match

The former world Champion Phil Taylor would open up his quest to become the champion for the 11th time by quickly disposing of Colin McGarry Taylor took the first two sets 30 and then the next two 31 to go through 40 dropping just two legs and averaging 9889  He would be now meeting old rival Dennis Priestley as the 16th seed went through with a tense 43 win over Richie Buckle

With the increased number of days play the tournament held two matches in the afternoon session on New Years Eve The first one saw a repeat of the 1993 world final however John Lowe was unable to repeat the result He had led 30 against Alan Warriner but Warriner quickly dropping down the rankings recovered to win the match 43 taking the final set with a 42 tie
break margin

The final match of the third round saw the number 8 seed eliminated Denis Ovens recovered from 20 and 31 down to level the match at 33 However Alex Roy would go through to the fourth round with a straight legs victory in the decider winning through to meet Warriner in the last 16

Following the traditional evening off for New Years Eve the World Championships started 2004 at the fourth round stage In the last 16 matches were still best of 7 sets and all eight last 16 matches would be played today Following the surprising results in the third round just nine of the 16 seeds were remaining following the last 32 matches

In the opening match of the day Simon Whatley continued his run with a 41 win over Lionel Sams Sams had taken the first set 32 but Whatley replied in kind and then took 9 of the next 12 legs to book his place in Fridays quarterfinal matches Also heading through was Peter Manley the highest remaining seed from the bottom half of the draw knocked out 1983 champion Keith Deller 42 however he had been made to work for his victory Another 7 set thriller would be served up as Warriner moved through against Alex Roy Warriner took the first six legs to go 2 sets up Roy followed by taking 6 of the next 8 legs to level the match at 22 The titfortat game continued as Warriner and Roy both took their next sets comfortably the seventh set going to Alan by 3 legs to 0

The 7th seed Ronnie Baxter was heading home he lost 42 to Kevin Painter who hoped to reach the SemiFinals for the second successive year Painter took 9 of the first 14 legs as he went 30 up Baxter pinched the next two sets by 3 legs to 2 to close the gap to 1 set However this took a good deal out of Baxter and Painter strolled the sixth set to go through with a 9138 average Bob Anderson would also be going through to the quarterfinals he was unstoppable in the early stages against Dennis Smith taking a 31 lead over the number 6 seed However Smith responded taking the next two sets with the loss of three legs to level the match at 3 sets all Like Baxter Smith seemed jaded and Anderson took the decider 30 to go through to a match with Peter Manley

In the Home players duel Wayne Mardle and Colin Lloyd produced the match of the round taking a 31 lead Lloyd seemed to be cruising towards the quarterfinals his best run in a major since the 2002 world championship However from 31 down Mardle found a second wind winning 9 of the last 11 legs to take him through to the quarterfinals his first World Championship quarterfinal in the PDC In the battle of the old and current Masters the top seed Taylor was given a stern test by Dennis Priestley In a match played in a friendly spirit Taylor bossed the first two sets before Priestley took the third Taylor would edge the last two sets by 3 legs to 2 to win 41 however a 128 leg count doesnt do justice to the scoreline  In the final match Parts conqueror Mark Dudbridge would go through a 41 winner over Steve Beaton

Friday was quarterfinals day and matches had been extended to the best of 9 sets the first men to reach 5 sets would now qualify for the last four

The amazing run of form for Bob Anderson continued Averaging just under 91 Anderson took the first two sets and when Manley levelled the scores took the next three to win the match 52 and go through to the SemiFinals In the other afternoon match it was the end of the road for Mark Dudbridge Kevin Painter clinically winning 51 to book his match against Anderson

In the evening session Simon Whatley would also be found out he could take just six legs as Wayne Mardle booked his first ever PDC semifinal with a 51 win His opponent would be Phil Taylor after The Power took the first three sets in the grudge match against Alan Warriner and went on to win by five sets to one averaging 9826

A week ago 48 players lined up now just four remained Matches in the SemiFinals had been extended to the best of 11 sets however neither match went close

In the first match it was the end of the road for the 56 year old Bob Anderson Kevin Painter took nine of the first 10 legs in opening up a three set lead against the man drained after impressive wins over Jenkins Smith and Manley Anderson recovered to 22 in both the 4th and 5th sets however he was unable to convert them into victories as Painter moved 50 up and within one of a place in the final Painter took the sixth set by 31 to go through to the final a 60 winner Painter averaged 9672 but Anderson could be proud of his run which had seen him eliminate three seeds and get within one match of a second world final an average of 8769 for the tournament for the elder statesman of the game

In the second semifinal Phil Taylor took control early on against Wayne Mardle who played well After 4 sets Taylor was 40 up however he had been fortunate as two sets had been won in deciders Mardle got on the board in the fifth set by 32 and at 22 in the 6th was close to closing the gap to two sets Taylor pinched the 6th however to go 51 up Mardle replied by taking the 7th set but it delayed the inevitable Taylor taking the match 62 with a 10002 average

The final saw Phil Taylor up against Kevin Painter over the best of 13 sets If the 2003 final had been a classic this one lived up to its reputation Painter took the opening two sets in deciding legs to go 20 up At 22 in the third Painter had a chance to go 30 up but Taylor closed the gap However Painter took the next two sets 31 and 32 meaning that like John Part a year ago he led Taylor 41 after five sets at 22 in the sixth set Painter had his chances to lead 51 However Taylor recovered the sixth set and at the half way point the scoreline was 42 to Painter

The 6th set possibly changed things in the context of the match Painter who could arguably have been 60 up by this point against the 10time former world champion now began to struggle and Taylor took the seventh set threenil to close the gap to just the one set Painter held onto the lead by pinching the 8th set in a deciding leg to go 53 up However Taylor put on a spurt that saw him take 9 of the next 12 legs and to go in front by 6 sets to 5

Painter responded brilliantly taking the twelfth set 31 to level the match up at 66 The match entered the tiebreak in the 13th set and became the first PDC World Final to go to a sudden death leg as Painter and Taylor got level at 55 after almost four hours since the match began Painter who had thrown first in the set and twice was faced with a threedart outshot to win the title while leading 21 and 32 pulled his dart at the bullseye and Taylor hit the outerbull to throw first in the deciding leg Taylor opened up the leg with just 45 however Painter couldnt capitalise and was left on 316 after nine darts He again rallied setting up another threedart finish as Taylor eyed Double top Taylor missed at Double top then he missed at Double Ten and with unbearable tension hit the Double five to secure his 11th world title He then announced his retirement but changed his mind four days later

2003 PDC World Darts Championship
The 2003 Ladbrokescom World Darts Championship was the tenth World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it split from the British Darts Organisation in 1993 The tournament took place between 27 December 2002 and 4 January 2003 at the Circus Tavern Purfleet England Ladbrokes who sponsored the 1996 event with their Vernons brand took over sponsorship of the event from Skol

The field at the televised stages expanded for the first time since 1999 An extra qualifying round was introduced increasing the total number of players from 32 to 40 John Part defeated the defending champion and number one seed Phil Taylor in the final to end two incredible runs by Taylor  eight successive World titles and 44 successive victories at the Circus Tavern

This was Parts second world championship having also won the 1994 BDO Championship the first tournament after the split


All matches are the best of 7 sets

Highest threedart checkout 170 Roland Scholten Les Fitton

Tournament 180s scored 277 in 818 legs

Most 180s scored individual 27 John Part 22 Phil Taylor 18 Richie Burnett
This table shows the number of players by country in the World Championship the total number including the 1st round

Steve Brown the 1994 World Championship Semifinalist would become the first man through to the second draw with a 42 win over David Platt Platt a wildcard who had qualified via a competition in the People Newspaper  one of the tournaments key partners didnt disgrace himself at all and when leading 20 it looked good that he would move onto meet Phil Taylor in the second round However Browns experience told when he levelled the scores and would move through the next two sets to win

Australian Simon Whitlock would also be in round two following a 42 win over Paul Williams Having trailed 21 Whitlock won nine of the final 14 legs to book a date with number 6 seed and 2002 Finalist Peter Manley in round 2 Shayne Burgess the former world no3 who had recovered after a disastrous run of form in 2001 and 2002 including a 100 loss to Taylor in the World Matchplay 2002 would also move on to the second round following a 42 win over Arjan Moen who had been toetotoe at 22

Wayne Mardle the new boy to the PDC circuit having been in the quarterfinals and Semifinals of the BDO event would also begin clinically dropping 2 legs as he swept aside American Ray Carver by 4 sets to 0

Also going into round 2 on the first day in Purfleet was Reg Harding one of the perennial qualifiers who never seems to get beyond the opening round  this time he did just Mark Robinson took a commanding 30 lead against Harding before the Englishman fought back sneaking the sixth set 32 to draw level at 33 The decider would go all the way as Harding moved on to a match with 14th seed Kevin Painter in the second round Mark Holden would also go through in the 7th set beating Leeds Dave Smtih 31 in the deciding set

The First round would conclude with two matches today before the second round started Bob Anderson winner of the World Title in 1988 would be in terrific form as he lost just four legs in a 40 win over Al Hedman to move easily into round 2 and a match with 7th seed Colin Lloyd Mick Manning unlucky not to reach the last 16 in 2001 when he lost a sudden death leg to Dave Askew would take the final last 32 place in a 42 win over Lee Palfreyman

The Second round then opened up  matches still best of 7 sets  best of 5 legs Dennis Smith seeded 8th moving straight into the third round with a 41 win over former champion and four time beaten finalist at the Circus Tavern Dennis Priestley whose ranking had seriously deteriorated in the previous year since his first round exit as fifth seed twelve months ago  Priestley took the first set 32 but only took three other legs as Smiffy moved quickly onto a match with either 9th seed Denis Ovens or Alex Roy

Mark Holdens hopes of the title ended today with a 41 loss to Bravedart Jamie Harvey from Scotland Harvey seeded 15th would now face 2nd seed John Part or Cliff Lazarenko in the third round and hopes of a return to the quarterfinals of 2001 were still alive

Wayne Mardle produced a comeback at the Circus Tavern against 16th seed Peter Evison Mardle took the first set 31 but then proceeded to lose 9 of 13 legs as Evison moved on to take a 31 lead after four sets Mardle then won six legs in a row including checkouts of 115 and 144 saw Mardle get back on terms as the match moved into the deciding set Evison took the first but folded as Mardle took three legs on the bounce for a total of 9 in 10 as he moved to the third round stage on his debut at the Circus The winner of the next match between Taylor and Brown being Waynes opponent

Top seed Phil Taylor began his campaign for an 11th World Championship Title and a 9th in a row with a 41 win over Steve Brown Taylor had an average of 103 and took 6 of the first seven legs to go 20 up Brown recovered with a 30 set win to close the gap to 21 but they were to be his final legs Taylor took 6 more on the bounce to move into round 3 and a match with Mardle in the last 16

Six more third round places up for grabs as the first weekend concluded Denis Ovens would be the first man to move into the third round on Sunday with a 41 win over Alex Roy Ovens built a 30 lead but lost the fourth set Ovens took set five 31 to win 41 winning the match with a 157 checkout Dennis Smith in the third round for The Heat

Its rotten to play bad here Those were the words of John Lowe as the 13th seed was soon dispatched from the World Championship 41 by Les Fitton who led Phil Taylor in 2001 Fitton was brilliant in taking control of the scrappy sets and barely allowing Lowe shots at doubles to win legs Fitton would win 14 legs to Lowes 8 as he moved on to a match with either Alan Warriner or Rod Harrington

The man most people tipped to be the only threat to Taylor 2nd seed John Part would start his World Championship here with a 41 over Cliff Lazarenko Lazarenko 50 years old and with the support of much of the crowd fell 30 down before taking the fourth 32 Part won the 5th to progress to a match with Jamie Harvey though wasnt happy with his form

Rod Harringtons ranking had slipped worse than Dennis Priestleys and when the draw for the second round was made both he and Alan Warriner could curse their misfortune to draw each other early Two years ago this was a potential quarterfinal this year one wouldnt make it beyond the New Year The Iceman seeded fourth took a 20 lead before Harrington took set three to close the gap Warriner moved 31 ahead with a 30 set win before Harrington took the fifth However the home crowd were to be disappointed as Warriner moved on to round two by winning set six 32 for a 42 victory

Dave Askew had been to both the 2001 and 2002 Semifinals before losing 60 to Phil Taylor In the 2003 World Championship he began his campaign with a nervy 43 win over 1996 BDO World Champion Steve Beaton Askew led 10 trailed 21 led 32 before Beaton hauled himself level with askew at 3 sets each Askew took the 7th set 31 to move into the third round and a date with either Roland Scholten or Shayne Burgess

It would indeed be Scholten Seeded 5 Scholten took the first set 32 against Shayne Burgess Bulldog levelled up by winning the second set 31 However it was one way traffic from there Scholten winning 9 legs in a row to move through by four sets to one

The second round concluded today as the tournament moved towards its break for New Years Eve 7th seed Colin Lloyd one of the other Home players from Essex was given the fright of his life following a nervy 43 win over Bob Anderson who had recovered from 31 down to level at 33 and in the end Lloyd would be relieved to see the final double nailed as he won through to face Chris Mason who beat 10th seed Andy Jenkins 42 in a tight game early on before Mason twice a BDO semifinalist won through

Mick Manning also went out 41 to the number 3 seed Ronnie Baxter Hopeful that he could go one step further than his 1999 and 2000 World Championship final losses 65 to Barneveld and 60 to Hankey in the BDO and become the 2003 World Champion Baxter will now be linking up with 14th seed Kevin Painter who went through 41 against Reg Harding

The final third round pairing was Richie Burnett against Keith Dellar After six sets it was 33 Burnett won the deciding set 31 to win the match 43

6th seed Peter Manley was blown away 41 by Simon Whitlock of Australia Whitlock coolly under pressure took the first three sets in deciding legs to go 30 up when it could have been 30 Manley or 21 Manley sneaked home in the fourth to close the gap to 31 but he never looked like a winner a clearly shellshocked Whitlock taking the 5th set 30 to win 41

Following the traditional New Years Eve break the World Championships resumed in 2003 at the third round stage Matches now had been extended to best of 9 sets so the first man to five goes through to the quarterfinals

First man through to the quarterfinals today was Roland Scholen who swept past 12th seed Dave Askew by 5 sets to nil His opponent in the next round would be Alan Warriner who had a real battle with Les Fitton Fitton led 42 before Warriner levelled at 44 The set went 22 so the tiebreaker came into operation 33 and 44 before Warriner squeezed home 64 Had it been 55 then the sudden death leg would have taken place for the second time in the 2003 event

Dennis Smith would also be through the 2000 semifinalist sweeping home 51 against Denis Ovens in what was a cruel scoreline for The Heat as four of the six sets went 32 and the other pair 31 Smith would now meet Taylor or Mardle

The first of many classics between the pair was upon us

A 152 checkout from Mardle in the first leg set the tone for a strange game but a classic match  6 legs in a row from the Power saw him go 20 up and at 22 in the third set could have gone 30 up Mardle did win that set to close the gap Taylor edged the fourth 32 to go 31 in front before Mardle edged sets five and six 32 to level the scores at 33 However Taylor took the seventh and eighth sets 31 and to his and wife Yvones clear relief he was in the quarterfinals

Joining him would be number 2 seed John Part who had a tough time against Jamie Harvey of Scotland Harvey led 3 sets to 2 before Part recovered to win the final three sets and keep alive the possibility of a Final with Taylor on Sunday Parts opponent would be Chris Mason who ended the Essex crowds hopes of a home world Champion Chris in honest was ruthless taking 5 sets in a row after Lloyd had gone onenil up

Simon Whitlocks Purfleet adventure ended with a 53 loss to 11th seed Richie Burnett who should have won with more to spare as he quickly went 41 up Whitlock closed the gap to 43 but the Welshman took set eight 30 to set up a tie with 14th seed Kevin Painter who shocked Ronnie Baxter 53

A week ago 40 players lined up now eight remained QuarterFinals were still best of 9 sets and the first man to five would take a spot in the Semifinals on Saturday

John Part kept his hope of a Final with Taylor alive following a highquality 50 drubbing of Chris Mason Part made no mistake on dealing swiftly with Mason and dropped just four legs winning 15 as he moved into the last four 14th seed and surprise package Kevin Painter would be his opponent after The Artist brushed aside Richie Burnett to move to the Semifinals two more matches for the masterpiece  Four sets in a row from Painter to win 52 against Burnett who said hed had a terrible season

Part wasnt the only one desperate to meet Taylor 4th seed Alan Warriner claimed a 52 win over Roland Scholten and then stormed out of his Sky Sports interview to tell Taylor who was practising if you beat Smiffy I will sort you out

Warriner would get his chance though just for the second time this week Taylor had been extended and had to use his experience of getting through the tough matches in previous years to beat Dennis Smith 53 Smith led 32 and when 43 behind was 22 in legs Taylor seeded 1st again looked relieved to be through

Three of the top four seeds played on semifinals night Matches were extended to the Best of 11 sets so 6 sets and youre into the final

The first match was Part against Painter The first three sets went 22 and Part took a 2 sets to 1 lead it was just 87 in legs Painter won the fourth 31 before they shared 2 threetwo sets to make it 33 The leg count now 1514 to Painter showing how tight the match was Part won the seventh set 32 but Painter won the eight set 30 to level again

Part would sneak the final two sets 32 to win 64 In the end Painter could count himself unlucky as he took the most legs 2421 but still lost 64 The buildup to the Taylor v Warriner Semifinal was massive with Sky living on the storm out that Warriner could beat Taylor In the end it was a damp squib Taylor soon went 20 up in 6 straight legs Warriner won the third 31 but Taylor took the fourth 30 and the fifth 32 to go 41 up Taylor then won the sixth and seventh sets 30 Taylor won 61 and 195 in legs

The final would again be the best of 13 sets The last time these two had met Part had squeezed home and Taylor breezed through the night before It had led to a 70 for Taylor conceding three legs

Any inclinations of a match like that were soon ended as Part nailed a 121 checkout for the opening leg then hit double four and double ten to take the opening set 30 At 22 in set two Taylor missed double seven enabling Part to take this set too Taylor took the first leg of set three but Part nailed the next three legs to go three sets up

A 122 checkout from Taylor helped him to take his first set of the match but Part soon restored his threeset advantage Then Taylor stepped up a gear taking 12 of the next 14 legs and all of a sudden The Power had a 5 sets to 4 lead

Part however recovered brilliantly and took the tenth set 31 then edged the eleventh 32 to move within just one set of victory Taylor though fought back to take the twelfth set 31 forcing a deciding set

First blood in the decider went to Part with a 72 checkout before he missed double 15 for a 110 finish that would put him just one leg away from the title However Taylor missed double 16 thus giving Part another opportunity to make it 20 which he took It meant Taylor needed to take a minimum of four legs if Part wasnt to win another

Taylor closed the gap to 21 with a 98 checkout before in the fourth leg he needed to hit 121 to force a tiebreak He hit 17 and treble 18 before narrowly missing the bull It left Part with three darts for a 77 finish and the title Under enormous pressure he hit 19 18 and finally double top to end Taylors runs of eight successive World titles and 44 matches unbeaten at the Circus and take his second world championship in all after a truly thrilling final

Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox are the names of a pair of large statues of the American folk hero Paul Bunyan and his ox located in Bemidji Minnesota This roadside attraction has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1988 Much like the architecture found in such structures as the Benewah Milk Bottle the Teapot Dome Service Station or the comparably colossal Dinosaur Park sculptures in South Dakota it served to attract the attention of motorists passing by and coincided with the dramatic rise in the popularity of automobiles

The statues have been hailed by the Kodak Company as the second most photographed statues in the United States behind only Mount Rushmore in South Dakota

The city of Bemidji is located in a vast woodland and lake region As early as the 1890s the town saw a modest tourist trade When rail connections came to Bemidji in 1898 promoters began the development of lakeshore sites for cottages hotels and resorts Most of these resorts catered to hunters and anglers In the 1920s the rise in automobile popularity contributed to a significant boom in Bemidjis tourist industry but it along with the rest of the economy suffered during the Great Depression Enter Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox

As a means of stimulating tourism in Bemidji a number of local civic organizations sponsored a winter carnival meant to hype the citys resources for winter sports Due to Bemidjis once prominent status as a logging and lumbering center the celebrations focused on Paul Bunyan the largerthan life lumberjack who is an American folk hero On January 14 1937 the carnival opened with Earl L Grinols Sr the carnival king The onset of the carnival brought the unveiling of two giant statues one of Bunyan and the other of his giant blue ox Babe the pair would serve as carnival mascots Babe was brought into town on a Grinols Implement  Fuel Co truck arranged so that its exhaust exited through Babes nostrils

In March 2006 the Rotary Club of Bemidji raised 53000 and along with a 68000 federal grant set about to repair some damage to the statues In addition the money was to be used in maintenance with the majority slated for stabilizing the ground beneath the statues to lessen shifting in freezing temperatures The work also focused on a crack in Babe from the neck to the hindquarters which continued to widen despite yearly fixes by the city with caulk and blue paint

In October of 2013 local organizers ran the first Bemidji Blue Ox Marathon and planned the course to run past the statues

Paul Bunyan is approximately tall and measures across at his base From toe to heel Paul Bunyan measures  Babe the Blue Ox is about tall and across at the front hooves From nose to tail Babe measures about

Military history of South Africa
The military history of South Africa chronicles a vast time period and complex events from the dawn of history until the present time It covers civil wars and wars of aggression and of selfdefence both within South Africa and against it It includes the history of battles fought in the territories of modern South Africa in neighbouring territories in both world wars and in modern international conflicts

The arrival of the permanent settlements of the Dutch East India Company at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652 brought them face to face with the local people such as the Khoikhoi called Hottentots by the Dutch the San Bushmen and some Bantu peoples of South Africa While the Dutch traded with the Khoikhoi nevertheless serious disputes broke out over land ownership and livestock This resulted in attacks and counterattacks by both sides which were known as the KhoikhoiDutch Wars The First KhoikhoiDutch War took place in 1659 the second in 1673 and the third in 16741677

During 1664 tensions between England and the Netherlands rose with rumours of war being imminent  that same year Commander Zacharius Wagenaer was instructed to build a pentagonal castle out of stone at  On 26 April 1679 the five bastions were built The Castle of Good Hope is a fortification which was built on the original coastline of Table Bay and now because of land reclamation seems nearer the centre of Cape Town South Africa Built by the VOC between 1666 and 1679 the Castle is the oldest building in South Africa The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape but today houses the Castle Military Museum and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments

The Battle of Muizenberg was a small but significant battle for the future destiny of South Africa which took place at Muizenberg near Cape Town South Africa in 1795 it led to the capture of the Cape Colony by the United Kingdom A fleet of seven Royal Navy ships  five thirdrates Monarch 74 Victorious 74 Arrogant 74 America 64 and Stately 64 with the 16gun sloops Echo and Rattlesnake  under ViceAdmiral Elphinstone anchored in Simons Bay at the Cape of Good Hope in June 1795 having left England on 1 March Their commander suggested to the Dutch governor that he place the Cape Colony under the protection of the British monarch  in effect that he hand the colony over to Britain  which was refused Simons Town was occupied on 14 June by a force of 350 Royal Marines and 450 men of the 78th Highlanders before the defenders could burn the town Following skirmishes on 1 and 2 September a final general attempt to recapture the camp was prepared by the Dutch for the 3rd but at this point the British reinforcements arrived and the Dutch withdrew A British advance on Cape Town with the new reinforcements began on the 14th on the 16th the colony capitulated

The British assumed control of the Cape of Good Hope for the next seven years The Cape was returned to the restored Dutch government known as the Batavian Government in 1804 In 1806 the British returned and after again defeating the Dutch at the Battle of Blaauwberg stayed in control for more than 100 years

The Xhosa Wars also known as the Kaffir Wars or Cape Frontier Wars were a series of nine wars between parts of the Xhosa people and European settlers with their Xhosa allies from 1779 and 1879 in what is now the Eastern Cape in South Africa The wars were responsible for the Xhosa peoples loss of most of their land and the incorporation of its people into Europeancontrolled territories

The NdwandweZulu War of 18171819 was a war fought between the expanding Zulu kingdom and the Ndwandwe tribe in South Africa Shaka revolutionised traditional ways of fighting by introducing the assegai a spear with a short shaft and broad blade used as a closequarters stabbing weapon Under Shakas rule losing an assegai was punishable by death So it was never thrown like a javelin He also organised warriors into disciplined units known as Impis that fought in close formation behind large cowhide shields In the Battle of Gqokli Hill in 1819 his troops and tactics prevailed over the superior numbers of the Ndwandwe people who failed to destroy the Zulu in their first encounter

The Ndwandwe and the Zulus met again in combat at the Battle of Mhlatuze River in 1820 The Zulu tactics again prevailed pressing their attack when the Ndwandwe army was divided during the crossing of the Mhlatuze River Zulu warriors arrived at the Ndwande King Zwides headquarters near presentday Nongoma before news of the defeat and approached the camp singing Ndwandwe victory songs to gain entry Zwide fled with some of his offspring including Madzanga Most of the Ndwandwe abandoned their lands and migrated north and eastward This was the start of the Mfecane a catastrophic bloody migration of many different tribes in the area initially escaping the Zulus but themselves causing their own havoc after adopting Zulu tactics in war Shaka was the ultimate victor and his more peaceful descendants still live today throughout Zululand with customs and a way of life that can be easily traced to Shakas day

Mfecane Zulu also known as the Difaqane or Lifaqane Sesotho is an African expression which means something like the crushing or scattering It describes a period of widespread chaos and disturbance in southern Africa during the period between 1815 and about 1835

The Mfecane resulted from the rise to power of Shaka the Zulu king and military leader who conquered the Nguni peoples between the Tugela and Pongola rivers in the beginning of the 19th century and created a militaristic kingdom in the region The Mfecane also led to the formation and consolidation of other groups  such as the Matabele the Mfengu and the Makololo  and the creation of states such as the modern Lesotho

The Battle of Italeni in what is now KwaZuluNatal South Africa in early 1838 between the Voortrekkers and the Zulus during the period of the Great Trek resulted in the Zulu armies repulsing the Voortrekkers On 9 April near the Babanango Mountain Range a large Zulu impi army appeared consisting of approximately 8000 warriors The Voortrekker commandos returned to their camp on 12 April Boer general Piet Uys formed a raiding party of fifteen volunteers including his son Dirkie Uys During subsequent fighting Uys his son the Malan brothers as well as five of the volunteers were killed and the Voortrekkers were forced to retreat It has been speculated that without the lessons learnt as a result of the Battle of Italeni  such as fighting from the shelter of oxwagons whenever possible and choosing the place of battle rather than being enticed into unfavourable terrain  the Voortrekkers would not have succeeded in finally beating the Zulus at the Battle of Blood River eight months later

The Battle of Blood River  was fought on 16 December 1838 on the banks of the Blood River Bloedrivier in what is today KwaZuluNatal South Africa In the aftermath of the Weenen massacre a group of about 470 Voortrekkers led by Andries Pretorius defended a laager circle of ox wagons against Zulu impis ruled by King Dingane and led by Dambuza Nzobo and Ndlela kaSompisi numbering between 10 and 20 thousand The Zulus repeatedly and unsuccessfully attacked the laager until Pretorius ordered a group of horse riders to leave the encampment and engage the Zulus Partly due to the fact that the Voortrekkers used rifles and at least one light cannon against the Zulus spears as well as the good location and motivation of the Voortrekkers only three Voortrekkers were wounded and none perished that contrasted against the more than 3000 Zulu warriors who died The Voortrekkers credited God as the reason why they had won the battle as they had made a covenant asking for protection beforehand

The AngloZulu War was fought in 1879 between Britain and the Zulus and signalled the end of the Zulus as an independent nation It was precipitated by Sir Bartle Frere High Commissioner for Southern Africa who manufactured a casus belli and prepared an invasion without the approval of Her Majestys government

At the Battle of Isandlwana 22 January 1879 the Zulu overwhelmed and wiped out 1400 British soldiers This battle is considered to be one of the greatest disasters in British colonial history Isandlwana forced the policy makers in London to rally to the support of the prowar contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulu The first invasion of Zululand ended with the catastrophe of Isandlwana where along with heavy casualties the main centre column lost all supplies transport and ammunition and the British would be forced to halt their advances elsewhere while a new invasion was prepared At Rorkes Drift 2223 January 1879 139 British soldiers successfully defended the station against an intense assault by four to five thousand Zulu warriors

The Battle of Intombe was fought on 12 March 1879 between British and Zulu forces The Siege of Eshowe took place during a threepronged attack on the Impis of Cetshwayo at Ulundi The Battle of Gingindlovu uMgungundlovu was fought between a British relief column sent to break the Siege of Eshowe and the Impis of Cetshwayo on 2 April 1879 The battle restored the British commanders confidence in their army and their ability to defeat Zulu With the last resistance removed they were able to advance and relieve Eshowe The Battle of Hlobane was a total disaster for the British 15 officers and 110 men were killed a further 8 wounded and 100 native soldiers died The Battle of Kambula took place in 1879 when a Zulu army attacked the British camp at Kambula resulting in a massive Zulu defeat The Battle of Ulundi took place at the Zulu capital of Ulundi on 4 July 1879 and proved to be the decisive battle that finally broke the military power of the Zulu nation

The First Boer War also known as the First AngloBoer War or the Transvaal War was fought from 16 December 1880 until 23 March 1881 and was the first clash between the British and the South African Republic ZAR Boers It was precipitated by Sir Theophilus Shepstone who annexed the South African Republic Transvaal Republic for the British in 1877 The British consolidated their power over most of the colonies of South Africa in 1879 after the AngloZulu War and attempted to impose an unpopular system of confederation on the region The Boers protested and in December 1880 they revolted
The battles of Bronkhorstspruit Laings Nek Schuinshoogte and Majuba Hill proved disastrous for the British where they found themselves outmaneuvered and outperformed by the highly mobile and skilled Boer marksmen With the British commanderinchief of Natal George Pomeroy Colley killed at Majuba and British garrisons under siege across the entire Transvaal the British were unwilling to further involve themselves in a war which was already seen as lost As a result William Gladstones British government signed a truce on 6 March and in the final peace treaty on 23 March 1881 gave the Boers selfgovernment in the South African Republic Transvaal under a theoretical British oversight

The Jameson Raid 29 December 1895  2 January 1896 was a raid on Paul Krugers Transvaal Republic carried out by Leander Starr Jameson and his Rhodesian and Bechuanaland policemen over the New Year weekend of 189596 It was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers known as Uitlanders or in English Foreigners in the Transvaal but failed to do so Though the raid was ineffective and no uprising took place it did much to bring about the Second Boer War and the Second Matabele War

The affair brought AngloBoer relations to a dangerous low and the ill feeling was heightened by the Kruger telegram from the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II It congratulated Paul Kruger for defeating the raid as well as appearing to recognise the Boer republic and offer support The emperor was already perceived as antiBritish and a naval arms race had started between Germany and Britain Consequently the telegram alarmed and angered the British

The Second Boer War also known as the Second AngloBoer War the Second Freedom War Afrikaans and referred to as the South African War in modern times took place from 11 October 1899  31 May 1902 The war was fought between Great Britain and the two independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic referred to as the Transvaal by the British After a protracted hardfought war the two independent republics lost and were absorbed into the British Empire

In all the war had cost around 75000 lives  22000 British soldiers 7792 battle casualties the rest through disease 60007000 Boer Commandos 2000028000 Boer civilians mostly women and children due to disease in concentration camps and an estimated 20000 black Africans Boer allies who died in their own separate concentration camps The last of the Boer forces surrendered in May 1902 and the war ended with the Treaty of Vereeniging in the same month The war resulted in the creation of the Transvaal Colony which in 1910 was incorporated into the Union of South Africa The treaty ended the existence of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State as Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire

The Boers referred to the two wars as the Freedom Wars Those Boers who wanted to continue the fight were known as bittereinders or irreconcilables and at the end of the war a number like Deneys Reitz chose exile rather than sign an undertaking that they would abide by the peace terms Over the following decade many returned to South Africa and never signed the undertaking Some like Reitz eventually reconciled themselves to the new status quo but others waited for a suitable opportunity to restart the old quarrel At the start of World War I the bittereinders and their allies took part in a revolt known as the Maritz Rebellion

The Union of South Africa which came into being in 1910 tied closely to the British Empire joined Great Britain and the allies against the German Empire Both Prime Minister Louis Botha and Defence Minister Jan Smuts both former Second Boer War generals who had fought against the British then but who now became active and respected members of the Imperial War Cabinet See Jan Smuts during World War I

The Union Defence Force was part of significant military operations against Germany In spite of Boer resistance at home the Afrikanerled government of Louis Botha unhestitatingly joined the side of the Allies of World War I and fought alongside its armies The South African Government agreed to the withdrawal of British Army units so that they were free to join the European war and laid plans to invade German SouthWest Africa Elements of the South African army refused to fight against the Germans and along with other opponents of the Government rose in open revolt The government declared martial law on 14 October 1914 and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the Maritz Rebellion The leading Boer rebels got off lightly with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines See World War I and the Maritz Rebellion

The Union Defence Force saw action in a number of places


More than 146000 whites 83000 blacks and 2500 people of mixed race Coloureds and Asians served in South African military units during the war including 43000 in German SouthWest Africa and 30000 on the Western Front An estimated 3000 South Africans also joined the Royal Flying Corps The total South African casualties during the war was about 18600 with over 12452 killed  more than 4600 in the European theatre alone
The Commonwealth War Graves commission has records of 9457 known South African War dead during World War I 

There is no question that South Africa greatly assisted the Allies and Great Britain in particular in capturing the two German colonies of German South West Africa and German East Africa as well as in battles in Western Europe and the Middle East South Africas ports and harbours such as at Cape Town Durban and Simons Town were also important reststops refuellingstations and served as strategic assets to the British Royal Navy during the war helping to keep the vital sea lanes to the British Raj open

On the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary While it was closely allied with Great Britain being a coequal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king the South African Prime Minister on 1 September 1939 was none other than Barry Hertzog the leader of the proAfrikaner antiBritish National party that had joined in a unity government as the United Party

Hertzogs problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany The PolishBritish Common Defence Pact obligated Britain and in turn its dominions to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis After Hitlers forces attacked Poland in the morning of 1 September 1939 Britain declared war on Germany within a few days A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britains side led by the proAllied proBritish Afrikaner and former Prime Minister Jan Smuts and General against thencurrent Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa neutral if not proAxis

On 4 September 1939 the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzogs stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favour of Smuts Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africas global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope

Smuts took severe action against the proNazi South African Ossewabrandwag movement they were caught committing acts of sabotage and jailed its leaders for the duration of the war One of them John Vorster was to become future Prime Minister of South Africa See Jan Smuts during World War II

Prime Minister Jan Smuts was the only important nonBritish general whose advice was constantly sought by Britains wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war On 28 May 1941 Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army becoming the first South African to hold that rank Ultimately Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment to the King and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic Afrikaners leading to his eventual downfall whereas most Englishspeaking whites and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him See Jan Smuts during World War II

South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theatres of war South Africas contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops airmen and material for the North African campaign the Desert War and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa Numerous volunteers also flew for the Royal Air Force See South African Army in World War II South African Air Force in World War II South African Navy in World War II


Of the 334000 men volunteered for fulltime service in the South African Army during the war including some 211000 whites 77000 blacks and 46000 coloureds and Asians nearly 9000 were killed in action

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has records of 11023 known South African war dead during World War II

However not all South Africans supported the war effort The AngloBoer war had ended only thirty five years earlier and to some siding with the enemy was considered disloyal and unpatriotic These sentiments gave rise to The Ossewabrandwag Oxwagon Sentinel originally created as a cultural organisation on the Centenary of the Great Trek becoming more militant and openly opposing South African entry into the war on side of the British The organisation created a paramilitary group called Stormjaers storm chasers modelled on the Nazi SA or Sturmabteilung Storm Division and which was linked to the German Intelligence Abwehr and the German Foreign Office Dienstelle Ribbentrop via Dr Luitpold Werz  the former German Consul in Pretoria The Stormjaers carried out a number of sabotage attacks against the Smuts government and actively tried to intimidate and discourage volunteers from joining the army recruitment programs

In the Korean War the 2 Squadron The Flying Cheetahs took part as South Africas contribution It won many American decorations including the honour of a United States Presidential Unit Citation in 1952

Some sources list 35 deaths from 2 Squadron

The Simonstown Agreement was a naval cooperation agreement between the United Kingdom and South Africa signed 30 June 1955 Under the agreement the Royal Navy gave up its naval base at Simonstown South Africa and transferred command of the South African Navy to the government of South Africa In return South Africa promised the use of the Simonstown base to Royal Navy ships

US Intelligence believed that Israel participated in South African nuclear research projects and supplied advanced nonnuclear weapons technology to South Africa during the 1970s while South Africa was developing its own atomic bombs
According to David Albright writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Faced with sanctions South Africa began to organize clandestine procurement networks in Europe and the United States and it began a long secret collaboration with Israel although he goes on to say A common question is whether Israel provided South Africa with weapons design assistance although available evidence argues against significant cooperation According to the Nuclear Threat Initiative in 1977 Israel traded 30grams of tritium in exchange for 50 tons of South African uranium and in the mid80s assisted with the development of the RSA3 ballistic missile Also in 1977 according to foreign press reports it was suspected that South Africa signed a pact with Israel that included the transfer of military technology and the manufacture of at least six atom bombs

Chris McGreal has claimed that Israel provided expertise and technology that was central to South Africas development of its nuclear bombs In 2000 Dieter Gerhardt Soviet spy and a former commodore in the South African Navy claimed that Israel agreed in 1974 to arm eight Jericho II missiles with special warheads for South Africa


Between 1966 and 1989 South Africa waged a long and bitter counterinsurgency campaign against the Peoples Liberation Army of Namibia PLAN in SouthWest Africa PLAN was backed by the Soviet Union and a number of Warsaw Pact member states as well as several sympathetic newly independent African governments It also received considerable combat support from the Peoples Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola FAPLA and a sizeable contingent of Cuban military advisors In response South Africa underwent a massive military expansion to combat the PLAN threat which included the formation of several elite special forces units such as Koevoet 32 Battalion and the Reconnaissance Commando Regiment South African troops raided neighbouring states to strike at PLAN forward operating bases which occasionally entailed clashes with FAPLA and the Zambian Defence Force This largely undeclared conflict became known as the South African Border War during the late 1970s

SADF expeditionary forces targeted guerrilla bases refugees and rural infrastructure in Angola and Zambia depending initially on border raids patrols and air strikes to keep PLAN at bay This was eventually extended to a permanent SADF military presence throughout southern Angola with the objective of forcing PLAN bases to relocate further and further north While this strategy was successful it resulted in the parallel expansion of FAPLA with Soviet assistance to meet what Luanda perceived as a direct South African threat to Angolan sovereignty FAPLA and the SADF clashed continuously between 1981 and 1984 and again from 1987 to 1988 culminating in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale

The South African Border War was closely linked to the Angolan Civil War South African expeditionary units had openly invaded Angola in 1975 during Operation Savannah an illfated attempt to support two rival Angolan factions the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola UNITA and the National Liberation Front of Angola FNLA during the civil war The SADF was forced to withdraw under overwhelming pressure from thousands of Cuban combat troops When South Africa began intensifying its campaign against PLAN in the 1980s it reasserted its alliance with UNITA and took the opportunity to bolster that movement with training and captured PLAN weaponry

The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale proved to be a major turning point for both conflicts as it resulted in the Angolan Tripartite Accord in which Cuba pledged to withdraw its troops from Angola while South Africa withdrew from SouthWest Africa SouthWest Africa received independence as the Republic of Namibia in 1990

South Africa has produced a variety of significant weapons vehicles and planes for its own uses as well as for international export Some have been established weapons produced under licence and in other instances South Africa has innovated and manufactured its own weapons and vehicles The predominant manufacturer of weapons is Denel

During the 1960s and 1970s Armscor produced a great deal of South Africas armament as South Africa was under UN sanctions It was during this time that Armscor contracted with Gerald Bulls Space Research Corporation for advanced 155mm howitzer designs which it eventually produced used and exported to countries such as Iraq

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s it was common for antiapartheid political movements to form military wings such as Umkhonto we Sizwe MK which was created by the African National Congress and the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army APLA of the PanAfricanist Congress These functioned as de facto guerrilla armies carrying out acts of sabotage and waging a limited rural insurgency The guerrillas occasionally clashed with each other as their respective political organs jockeyed for internal influence

Though fought on a much smaller scale than the South African Border War the SADFs operations against MK and APLA mirrored several important aspects of that conflict Much like PLAN for example MK often sought sanctuary in states adjacent to South Africas borders The SADF retaliated with targeted assassinations of MK personnel on foreign soil and a combination of air strikes and special forces raids on MK bases in Zambia Mozambique Botswana and Lesotho

Both MK and APLA were disbanded and integrated with the South African National Defence Force SANDF following the abolition of apartheid

The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging AWB  Afrikaner Resistance Movement  was formed in 1973 in Heidelberg Transvaal a town southeast of Johannesburg It is a political and paramilitary group in South Africa and was under the leadership of Eugne TerreBlanche They are committed to the restoration of an independent Afrikaner republic or Boerestaat within South Africa In their heyday the period of transition in the early 1990s they received much publicity both in South Africa and abroad as an extremist white supremacist group

During the Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa the AWB stormed the venue the Kempton Park World Trade Centre breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car The invaders took over the main conference hall threatening delegates and painting slogans on the walls and left again after a short period
In 1994 before the advent of majority rule the AWB again gained international notoriety in its attempt to defend the dictatorial government of Lucas Mangope in the homeland of Bophuthatswana who opposed the upcoming elections and the dissolution of his homeland The AWB along with a contingent of about 90 Afrikaner Volksfront militiamen entered the capital of Mmabatho on 10 and 11 March
TerreBlanche was sentenced for the attempted murder of security guard Paul Motshabi but he only served three years In June 2004 he was released from prison Terreblanche claimed that while in prison he rediscovered God and has dropped some of his more violent and racist policies He preached reconciliation as prescribed by God in his later years TerreBlanche was murdered on his farm on 3 April 2010

The South African National Defence Force SANDF is the name of the presentday armed forces of South Africa The military as it exists today was created in 1994 following South Africas first postapartheid national elections and the adoption of a new constitution It replaced the South African Defence Force SADF and included personnel and equipment from the SADF and the former Homelands forces Transkei Venda Bophuthatswana and Ciskei as well as personnel from the former guerrilla forces of some of the political parties involved in South Africa such as the African National Congresss Umkhonto we Sizwe the Pan Africanist Congresss APLA and the SelfProtection Units of the Inkatha Freedom Party IFP

As of 2004 the integration process was considered complete with the integrated personnel having been incorporated into a slightly modified structure very similar to that of the SADF with the latters structure and equipment for the most part being retained

The commander of the SANDF is appointed by the President from one of the armed services The current commander is General Solly Shoke He in turn is accountable to the Minister of Defence currently Nosiviwe Noluthando MapisaNqakula

Some of the Traditional South African Regiments have been serving the country for over a hundred and fifty years under various iterations of political systems and different governments

The South African Department of Defences Strategic Defence Acquisition known as the Arms Deal aimed to modernise its defence equipment which included the purchase of corvettes submarines light utility helicopters leadin fighter trainers and advanced light fighter aircraft This saw the SANDF being provided with modern equipment

Recent peacekeeping actions on the behalf of the South African military include the South African intervention in Lesotho in order to restore the democratically elected government after a coup as well as extensive contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi An operation to Sudan has recently begun and is scheduled to be increased to Brigade strength

Issues that face the SANDF include a severe shortage of pilots and naval combat officers due to the replacement of white officers from the former SADF with appointments from the old liberation forces and emigration The loss of trained personnel and the decommissioning of much needed equipment due to funding issues high HIVrates amongst personnel and the fact that SANDF infantry soldiers are some of the oldest in the world all raise questions regarding the current fighting efficiency of the SANDF Some of these issues are being addressed with the introduction of the Military Skills Development MSD programme as well as aggressive recruitment and training by the Reserve Force Regiments

Recently the SANDF has been involved in combat in both the Central African Republic Bangui as well as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo FIB The performance of the SANDF soldiers in combat in these two theatres has gone a long way towards silencing critics of the combat effectiveness of the actual soldiers but has refocused the debate on that of the political leadership as well as the procurement and recruitment issues that still abound

Four armed services make up the forces of the SANDF

Rodderberg
The Rodderberg is an extinct volcano in the east of the municipality of Wachtberg near Bonn Germany The last eruption was 250000years ago

It is situated just above the Rhinevalley Together with the Drachenfels directly opposite the Rodderberg narrows the Rhinevalley This gorge portion is the southern limit of the lowlandbay of Cologne

The Rodderberg offers views to the Siebengebirge the Rhinevalley and up to the Cologne Cathedral about 50km away

The Rodderberg detonated in a phreatomagmatic eruption about 250000years ago This happened when the magmatic plume reached the groundwater level of the Rhine about 50m higher than today After the explosion the crater was filled with water that formed a maar of about 90m depth In the last 250000years this feature filled with dust and soil until it was filled up to todays level

At present all that is left of the old Volcano is just a small hill which has a shallow craterous form on its surface  if one doesnt know that it is a volcano you would not see it

History of Pocklington
The town of Pocklington in the East Riding of Yorkshire England has a recorded written history that goes back around 1500 years and archaeological evidence shows settlement at the site as long as 2500 years ago This gives it a longer history of settlement than larger contemporary settlements in the region and country such as York and even London During this time it has experienced plague several invasions the loss of its railway and its marginalisation to a backwater under the Romans Nevertheless Pocklington has prospered where other market towns have failed It has always been the commercial and civic centre for the district and was at one point the second largest settlement in Yorkshire It is the focal point of an area which has seen significant events through the centuries many influencing English history

Pocklington gets its name via the Old English Poclintun from the Anglian settlement of Pocels or Pocelas people and the Old English word tun meaning farm or settlement A D Mills The Popular Dictionary of English PlaceNames but though the towns name can only be traced back to around 650AD the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1000 years or more to the Bronze Age

It is not known exactly when there was first a settlement at Pocklington  archaeologists have found Iron Age remains in and around the town and many Bronze Age burials and other finds have been discovered in the neighbourhood More recently in 2016 builders uncovered an earlier Bronze Age settlement dating to around 800BC

In 1937 wooden planks belonging to an ancient boat were discovered by a local man in nearby Ferriby Originally estimated to date from 1300BC newer estimates using radiocarbon dating have placed the boats between the years 1890BC to 1700BC

Certainly the Wolds area as a whole was a very attractive location for settlements to ancient man who preferred to stay clear of the poorly drained and often flooded neighbouring vales  before the draining of a lot of land in the medieval era the flat land to the west and south of Pocklington was very marshy

Archaeologists have experienced problems in recovering early remains and artefacts from the area intact because of the damage and disruption caused by centuries of arable land use  one skeleton discovered in 2005 was intact apart from its skull which had been sheared off and crushed by a plough

Ptolemy relates that the Parisii an ancient Briton tribe with branches in France and after which Paris itself is named inhabited a large part of what is now the East Riding of Yorkshire in the late Iron Age 50BC Ptolemy Geography They were probably displaced to Britain by population movements on the continent It is possible that Pocklington was settled by the Parisii as early as the 5thcenturyBC but certainly by the time the Parisii participated in the general rising of Vercingetorix against Julius Caesar in 52BC there is strong evidence that their regional capital was based at Pocklington itself

Archeology has also discovered a substantial late Iron Age settlement of roundhouses in nearby Hayton

It is during the era of the Roman occupation that Pocklington suffered something of a reversal in its development It was eclipsed by York as the prominent settlement within the Yorkshire region with the City of York effectively beginning its life during this era and swiftly eclipsing Pocklignton in size and importance Despite Pocklingtons existing status and size at the time York was favoured as the site of the Roman city Eboracum in around 71AD It is thought to have been selected whilst Pocklington was ignored because of its better water access River Ouse accessible via Humber estuary and because it was a naturally crossing point on a plain of routes from all directions

Despite Ermine Street the primary Roman arterial road north from London running close by Pocklington the town was not garrisoned by Roman forces A legionary barracks and important Roman town were constructed in York which was for several years the home of the Roman Imperial Court and effectively the centre of administration for the Roman Empire but Pocklington likely remained a Romaninfluenced but little altered Iron Age settlement There is archaeological evidence for some signs of Romanization cultural in Pocklington including a Romanstyle bathhouse

The Roman name for Pocklington is not known but it is thought that Pocklington might be the presently unlocated Delgovicia meaning out of the way place or literally backwater However Millington and Malton are competing candidates for this placename also By the time Ptolemy wrote his Geography in approximately 140AD he made no mention of Pocklington but instead referred to the capital of the RomanoBritish Parisi as being located in Petuaria near modernday Brough Given that the Parisi themselves were nonliterate and Ptolemy was writing at some remove it is difficult now to know whether their capital shifted from Pocklington to Brough or whether it was always at Pocklington or always at Brough

Around this time the Roman authorities raised an irregular auxiliary unit from the area known as the Company of Newcomers Collingwood  Wright The Roman Inscriptions of Britain

There is also evidence of a Roman villa just outside Pocklington and although it is not known who occupied it is suspected to have been a RomanoBritish chief

In 2004 diggers excavating the site near Pocklington unearthed fragments of a human skeleton which almost certainly dated back to Roman times A quantity of Roman era pottery dating back to between 70AD and 410AD has also been uncovered scattered across the same field

It is known that at least as early as the 4thcentury large tracts of land in the Pocklington area and the Wolds were granted to Germanic Foederati  continental warlords possibly of the Alemanni who were given areas of farmland in return for military service It is not known to what extent this influx replaced or mingled with the earlier inhabitants

It was some time before 650AD that Pocklington gained its current name meaning farmstead belonging to Pocelas people It is not known what name Pocklington was known by before that date

It is reputed that the ancient kingdom of Deira has its capital nearby It is likely that the missionary Paulinus established the first Christian church in Pocklington on his way from Goodmanham to found York Minster Certainly the Sotheby Cross dating from the late 14thcentury in the churchyard at All Saints Church has the inscription Paulinus here preached and celebrated AD627

The Great Heathen Army of the Vikings captured much of the area in 866 and in 876 their remnants settled permanently in parts of the Yorkshire countryside Viking kings ruled this area known to historians as The Viking Kingdom of Jorvik for almost a century In 954 the last Viking king Eric Bloodaxe was expelled and his kingdom was incorporated in the newly consolidated AngloSaxon state

Many English towns are able to find mention of themselves in the Domesday Book William the Conquerors catalogue of the country Even before the Norman Conquest however records of Pocklington are found in taxation census of Anglo Saxon kings

Pocklington steadily evolved from Anglo Saxon times as the centre of the surrounding agricultural area Before the Norman conquest when King Harolds brotherinlaw Earl Morcar was Lord of the Manor it was a prosperous settlement

The Battle of Stamford Bridge was fought just 4 miles from Pocklington and was the first of two major battles in that year for control of the country the other being the Battle of Hastings The former marked the end of Viking rule in England and the latter ushered in a period of Norman rule

After the Norman conquest the manor at Pocklington became a royal manor  with the Percy family as the Kings overlords  and under this royal patronage Pocklington continued to prosper Pocklington was recorded in the Domesday Book as Poclinton and given its current size it is surprising to note that at the time of Domesday 1086 it is recorded as being the second largest settlement in Yorkshire after York itself showing clearly that it had bounced back from its marginalisation in Roman Britain

Pocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact it was a local centre for the trading of wool and that it lay on the main road to York an important national centre for the export of wool to the Continent Wool was Englands principal export in the Middle Ages

A weekly market and regular fairs in the town were held by Royal Charter in 1245 Regular fairs continued until the early 1900s

The towns All Saints Church is the only survivor from the Middle Ages Known as the Cathedral of the Wolds it dates from the late 12th to early 15thcenturies Although containing some fragments of the earlier Norman church its foundations go back further to the original Saxon era The clerestory is 13thcentury and the tower is 15th

Parish records show that the Black Death the bubonic plague struck Pocklington hard in 1350 a year after its first outbreak in London and the south coast

Pocklington School was founded in 1514 as the Guild of the Parish Church by senior churchmen and politician John Dolman His family became Lords of the Manor in the 14thcentury

In 1400 Pocklington was one of 30 East Riding of Yorkshire settlements which could be termed market towns By 1750 there were just 10 and Pocklington was one Over the next 150 years the town trebled in size with a host of new trades joining existing agricultural brewing and milling interests

Pocklington has one of the few Cromwellian charters in the country The town charter was granted on 8 September 1656 one of the few during Oliver Cromwells 11 years

Pocklington also lays claim to being the last place in England to hold a witch burning In 1630 the parish register for that year records Old Wife Green burnt in Market for being a witch

In 1848 a cache of more than 500 coins from 1500 to 1700 was found on the edge of town

And 19 years later the towns most notorious resident Isabella Bilington aged 32 was sentenced to death at York Assizes for crucifying her mother at Pocklington After the killing she burnt a calf and a cock as a sacrifice Her husband too was hanged as an accomplice

William Wilberforce wrote his first public letter against the slave trade while at Pocklington School from 177176 and went on to be the driving force behind the abolition of slavery in the early 19thcentury This is celebrated by the broken linked chain in the present town coat of arms

John Wesley the founder of Methodism was a frequent visitor to Pocklington in the late 18thcentury and is among several notable churchmen bishops and titular archbishops born or educated in the town A Wesleyan Methodist Church survives in use in Pocklington to this day

Entertainment also earned the town notoriety The celebrated Flying Man of Pocklington Thomas Pelling attempted in 1733 to travel along a rope between the church and the Star Inn in the Market Square He crashed to his death fracturing his skull against the wall of the church following a misunderstanding with men working the windlass He is buried where he fell at the east end of the church where a plaque celebrates his memory

In 1759 a Pocklington brewer called Timothy Overland received a piece of land on the York to Beverley road on the southern fringe of Pocklington and built the Pocklington New Inn By 1778 the establishment was a prosperous Coach House at the height of the coaching era The building is still in the same use today as the Pocklington Motel

By this time the seat of the Lord of the Manor had transferred to Kilnwick Percy Hall The present house was built in 1784 although there had been a hall there for many centuries Unfortunately a large section of it fell into disrepair and was pulled down during the 1940s The remainder has belatedly been classed as a Grade II listed Georgian mansion

Steady further growth continued during the 19thcentury which saw much of the town completely rebuilt

In 1814 an act of parliament was passed for making a navigable canal from East Cottingwith to Street Bridge about a mile from Pocklington An early draft of this Parliamentary act was recently discovered in the attic of a Pocklington house By 1818 the Pocklington Canal linked Pocklington to the River Derwent It fell into disuse with the decline of Britains canals but has been continuously resurrected by the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society since 1971 and the old mill house is now classed as a Grade II listed water mill of historic interest most of the mill mechanism still exists

In 1821 the entire parish contained 2163 inhabitants of which 1962 were of the township of Pocklington itself

In 1868 Pocklingtons inhabitants are described as being for the most part employed in agricultural pursuits and in ropemaking brickmaking brewing and malting There are besides corn mills iron foundries and agricultural implement manufactories which materially contribute to the industrial wealth of the town

In 1890 extensive repairs and alterations were made to All Saints Church and in a foreshadowing of modern interest in time capsules a message detailing the work was sealed in a glass bottle along with an 1890 newspaper and buried underneath the plith of the medieval Sotheby Cross Unearthed accidentally during repairs in 2005 the sealed message and a copy of the 1890 newspaper were reburied in the same spot along with a contemporary copy of the Pocklington Post

The group of five airfields based in and around Pocklington played an active role in the Second World War Pocklington Airfield was completed in April 1941 The first operational unit to occupy Pocklington was the Canadian No 405 Squadron with Wellington aircraft but in 1942 the RAFs 102 Ceylon Squadron took over the airfield flying night sorties to bomb targets in France They still hold an annual reunion in Pocklington It was disbanded on 20 October 1954

During the Second World War a few houses in Pocklington were subject to bombing after their street was mistaken for the airfield

Those serving on HMS Volage also keep close ties with the town that adopted them during the war sending letters and parcels The association with Pocklington continues with a new housing estate being named Volage Court in recognition of the links with HMS Volage

Pocklington used to be served by a railway connection but this was closed in the Beeching Report era of the 1960s Some existing lengths of trackway can be seen behind the old railway station now used as the sports hall for Pocklington School There has been some talk of bringing the railway line back to Pocklington but there has been substantial development along the original line after the land was sold off and the original route is no longer practical There are serious doubts also as to the financial feasibility of reopening the line

Pocklington experienced a rapid expansion in the final two decades of the 20thcentury with large amounts of green land being ceded to new housing development to meet the demands of both lower housing occupancy rates a trend common across the country and also demand for commuter belt housing for the cities of York and Leeds

Throughout its long history Pocklington has faced difficult times like recession wartime and the closing of the railway but each time the town has overcome and gone on to develop further

East Yi West Xia
East Yi West Xia  is an obsolete theory about the origin of prehistory culture in current China which says that the culture of Shang dynasty was established by two ethnic groups namely that the Western part of the Shang dynasty was developed by Xia ethnic group and the eastern part of Shang dynasty was developed by Yi ethnic group

This theory was suggested by future linguist Fu Sinian in his thesis 1933 It was further expanded by Liang Siyong who suggested that the newly discovered Yangshao culture was established by the Xia in the west and the Longshan culture by the Yi peoples of the east For Chinese and Western historians this hypothesis became the prevailing theory to interpret Chinese prehistory and remained so until about 1960

Further archaeological discoveries made the theory obsolete In 1950s it became clear that the Yinxu culture was preceded by the Erligang culture in Zhongyuan In addition the gap between the Erligang culture and the Longshan culture was joined by the Erlitou culture which was named after the Erlitou site discovered in 1959 Chinese scholars identify the Erligang and Erlitou cultures as the sites of the Shang and Xia Dynasties respectively although the archaeological boundary between the two dynasties was still debatable In 1983 the ruin of Yanshi Shang City was discovered and identified as the Erligang culture The ruin very close to the Erlitou site suggests that the Erlitou and Erligang cultures were dominated by people with different cultural background

In Shandong the Shandong Longshan culture was replaced by the Yueshi culture around 2000 BC The sites of the Yueshi culture show complementary distribution with those of the Erligang culture which expanded eastward from Zhongyuan It proved that the Shang people did not originated in the east

Though largely modified by further research Fu Sinians theory entered the history as a landmark in Chinese historiography It essentially questioned ethnic homogeneity sometimes postulated as the route of Chinese civilization This contributed to the concept of the dialogical development of cultures

Conocarpus lancifolius
Conocarpus lancifolius one of two species in the genus Conocarpus is a tree in the family Combretaceae native to coastal and riverine areas of Somalia Djibouti and Yemen It is found throughout the Horn of Africa the Arabian peninsula and South Asia

The tree has no common name in English In Somali it is called qalab in Arabic the name is damas It is also commonly found in residential compounds in Dubai

The trees wood is dense and suitable for charcoal Goats use the young trees and shoots as fodder although the leaves contain tannin Because of its high salt tolerance and relative drought tolerance the tree is sometimes planted as a pioneer species in reafforestation projects in its native habitat The tree has a symmetrical growth habit and can easily be shaped into a variety of different forms It can be shaped into short and tall hedges and is effective for creating a visual or a noise barrier With suitable plant spacing it can also be grown as a hardy singlestemmed tree which is good for shade The tree has been extensively used in Karachi for landscaping along roads and by homeowners as a tall hedging tree for screening purposes The tree thrives exceptionally well in the hot and dry climate of the city

Hoboken Four
The Hoboken Four was a musical quartet formed in 1935 uniting a trio of ItalianAmerican musicians who called themselves the 3 Flashes with aspiring singer Frank Sinatra The trio had been based in Hoboken New Jersey before meeting Sinatra in 1934 after which Sinatra drove them and their instruments to gigs outside the city and occasionally performed with them Following their winning performance on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour on September 8 1935 the newlyformed quartet embarked on a sevenmonth tour of the central and western United States and Canada with one of Major Bowes touring companies Tensions between the quartet members escalated however to the point that Sinatra was regularly beaten by the other members and he quit the tour halfway through He returned to Hoboken to pursue a solo career while the rest of the group disbanded after the tour ended

The original trio was composed of three Italian Americans who were childhood friends on Sixth Street in Hoboken New Jersey James Jimmy Skelly Petrozelli Patrick Patty Prince Principe and Fred Freddie Tamby Tamburro They worked as truck drivers and sang and danced as a group They had a regular weekend set at the Rustic Cabin a roadhouse located on US Route 9W near Alpine New Jersey about from Hoboken

In 1934 the 19yearold Frank Sinatra attached himself to the group offering to drive them and their instruments to gigs outside Hoboken in his sports car According to Tamburro Frank hung around us like we were gods or something We took him along for one simple reason Frankieboy had a car He used to chauffeur us around Sinatra also acted as their unofficial manager renting the four of them to schools and club bands with himself as the featured singer for a small additional fee Sinatra had larger ambitions than being a manager or driver he wanted to sing on stage and performing with the 3 Flashes was the break he sought

In September 1935 the 3 Flashes decided to audition for the Major Bowes Amateur Hour a radio show that encouraged listeners to vote for their favorite act either by calling the station or sending a postcard The act that gained the most votes won the opportunity to go on a road tour with one of Major Bowes touring companies Sinatra also decided to audition as a solo singer While the trio and the singer were accepted separately Major Bowes felt it wouldnt do to promote two acts from the same town and put them together as a quartet which he renamed the Hoboken Four According to another version of the story it was Sinatras mother Dolly who persuaded the trio to accept Sinatra as a permanent member

Appearing on the September 8 1935 program broadcast from the Capitol Theater in New York City the quartet was introduced by Major Bowes as singing and dancing fools When asked to introduce themselves each of the 3 Flashes cited their places of work when they were not out of work When it was Sinatras turn Tamburro joked This feller here has never worked at all Sinatra said Im Frank Were looking for a job How about it Everyone thats ever heard us likes us We think were pretty good

The group sang Shine by the Mills Brothers and Sinatra performed Night and Day by Cole Porter The group won the contest hands down it was claimed that over 40000 calls were received the biggest response in the programs history The following month the group appeared in two short films produced by Major Bowes The Nightclub and The Big Minstrel Act In the latter film the singers wore blackface The shorts aired at Radio City Music Hall

The Hoboken Four returned to compete several times on the Major Bowes Amateur Hour calling themselves by different names each time including the Seacaucus Cockamamies the Bayonne Bacalas the Jive Four and the Jolly Jersey Gypsies of Song They won each contest During his live performance at the Sands in 1966 Sinatra said that Major Bowes had to change the name to fool other contenders and the audience from realizing it was the same winning group competing against a fresh pack of amateurs Sinatra often joked about the dozens of names his group was given and how Major Bowes kept rigging the show for them to win

In the winter of 19351936 the Hoboken Four embarked on a sevenmonth bus and train tour of vaudeville theaters in the central and western United States and Canada with one of Major Bowes touring companies Each member received 50 per week plus meals which was more money than any of them had ever earned before They performed 35 shows per week in 39 states Songs that were added to their repertoire included The Way You Look Tonight and A Fine Romance

The grind of constant traveling and lodging in substandard accommodations generated tension among the quartet members At one stop Sinatra either started giggling on stage or cracked a joke about Tamburro on stage and Tamburro decked him after the show Sinatras talent and selfconfidence were evident to everyone in the touring company as well as his ability to attract female fans and Tamburro and Petrozelli began taking out their frustrations by beating up Sinatra from time to time Before the end of 1935 Sinatra had had enough He quit the tour and returned home to Hoboken

The original 3 Flashes continued with the tour as the Hoboken Trio but soon decided to call it quits themselves Petrozelli and Principe found jobs in Keansburg New Jersey while Tamburro went back to being a truck driver with an occasional singing gig

Islanding
Islanding is the condition in which a distributed generator DG continues to power a location even though electrical grid power is no longer present Islanding can be dangerous to utility workers who may not realize that a circuit is still powered and it may prevent automatic reconnection of devices Additionally without strict frequency control the balance between load and generation in the islanded circuit is going to be violated leading to abnormal frequencies and voltages For those reasons distributed generators must detect islanding and immediately disconnect from the circuit this is referred to as antiislanding

A common example of islanding is a distribution feeder that has solar panels attached to it In the case of a power outage the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as irradiance is sufficient In this case the circuit detached by the outage becomes an island For this reason solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have some sort of automatic antiislanding circuitry

Some designs commonly known as a microgrid allow for intentional islanding In case of an outage a microgrid controller disconnects the local circuit from the grid on a dedicated switch and forces the distributed generators to power the entire local load

In the context of nuclear power plants islanding is an exceptional mode of operation of a nuclear reactor In this mode the power plant is disconnected from the grid and cooling systems especially the pumps are powered using only the power generated by the reactor itself For some reactor types islanding is part of the normal procedure when the power plant disconnects from the grid in order to quickly recover electricity production When islanding fails emergency systems such as diesel generators take over For instance French nuclear power plants are conducting islanding tests every 4 years The Chernobyl disaster is a failed islanding test

Electrical inverters are devices that convert direct current DC to alternating current AC Gridinteractive inverters have the additional requirement that they produce AC power that matches the existing power presented on the grid In particular a gridinteractive inverter must match the voltage frequency and phase of the power line it connects to There are numerous technical requirements to the accuracy of this tracking

Consider the case of a house with an array of solar panels on the roof Inverters attached to the panels convert the varying DC current provided by the panels into AC power that matches the grid supply If the grid is disconnected the voltage on the grid line might be expected to drop to zero a clear indication of a service interruption However consider the case when the houses load exactly matches the output of the panels at the instant of the grid interruption In this case the panels can continue supplying power which is used up by the houses load In this case there is no obvious indication that an interruption has occurred

Normally even when the load and production are exactly matched the socalled balanced condition the failure of the grid will result in several additional transient signals being generated For instance there will almost always be a brief decrease in line voltage which will signal a potential fault condition However such events can also be caused by normal operation like the starting of a large electric motor

Methods that detect islanding without a large number of false positives is the subject of considerable research Each method has some threshold that needs to be crossed before a condition is considered to be a signal of grid interruption which leads to a nondetection zone NDZ the range of conditions where a real grid failure will be filtered out For this reason before field deployment gridinteractive inverters are typically tested by reproducing at their output terminals specific grid conditions and evaluating the effectiveness of the islanding methods in detecting islanding conditions 

Given the activity in the field and the large variety of methods that have been developed to detect islanding it is important to consider whether or not the problem actually demands the amount of effort being expended Generally speaking the reasons for antiislanding are given as in no particular order


The first issue has been widely dismissed by many in the power industry Line workers are already constantly exposed to unexpectedly live wires in the course of normal events ie is a house blacked out because it has no power or because they pulled the main breaker inside Normal operating procedures under hotline rules or deadline rules require line workers to test for power as a matter of course and it has been calculated that active islands would add a negligible risk However other emergency workers may not have time to do a line check and these issues have been extensively explored using riskanalysis tools A UKbased study concluded that The risk of electric shock associated with islanding of PV systems under worstcase PV penetration scenarios to both network operators and customers is typically 10 per year

The second possibility is also considered extremely remote In addition to thresholds that are designed to operate quickly islanding detection systems also have absolute thresholds that will trip long before conditions are reached that could cause enduser equipment damage It is generally the last two issues that cause the most concern among utilities Reclosers are commonly used to divide up the grid into smaller sections that will automatically and quickly reenergize the branch as soon as the fault condition a tree branch on lines for instance clears There is some concern that the reclosers may not reenergize in the case of an island or that the rapid cycling they cause might interfere with the ability of the DG system to match the grid again after the fault clears

If an islanding issue does exist it appears to be limited to certain types of generators A 2004 Canadian report concluded that synchronous generators installations like microhydro were the main concern These systems may have considerable mechanical inertia that will provide a useful signal For inverter based systems the report largely dismissed the problem Antiislanding technology for inverter based DG systems is much better developed and published risk assessments suggest that the current technology and standards provide adequate protection while penetration of DG into the distribution system remains relatively low The report also noted that views on the importance 
of this issue tend to be very polarized with utilities generally considering the possibility of occurrence and its impacts while those supporting DG systems generally use a risk based approach and the very low probabilities of an island forming

An example of such an approach one that strengthens the case that islanding is largely a nonissue is a major realworld islanding experiment that was carried out in the Netherlands in 1999 Although based on thencurrent antiislanding system typically the most basic voltage jump detection methods the testing clearly demonstrated that islands could not last longer than 60 seconds Moreover the theoretical predictions were true the chance of a balance condition existing were on the order of 10 a year and that the chance that the grid would disconnect at that point in time was even less As an island can only form when both conditions are true they concluded that the Probability of encountering an islanding is virtually zero

Nevertheless utility companies have continued to use islanding as a reason to delay or refuse the implementation of distributed generation systems In Ontario Hydro One recently introduced interconnection guidelines that refused connection if the total distributed generation capacity on a branch was 7 of the maximum yearly peak power At the same time California sets a limit of 15 only for review allowing connections up to 30 and is actively considering moving the reviewonly limit to 50

The issue can be hotly political In Ontario a number of potential customers taking advantage of a new Feedin tariff program were refused connection only after building their systems This was a problem particularly in rural areas where numerous farmers were able to set up small 10 kWp systems under the capacity exempt microFIT program only to find that Hydro One had implemented a new capacity regulation after the fact in many cases after the systems had been installed

Detecting an islanding condition is the subject of considerable research In general these can be classified into passive methods which look for transient events on the grid and active methods which probe the grid by sending signals of some sort from the inverter or the grid distribution point There are also methods that the utility can use to detect the conditions that would cause the inverterbased methods to fail and deliberately upset those conditions in order to make the inverters switch off A Sandia Labs Report covers many of these methodologies both inuse and future developments These methods are summarized below

Passive methods include any system that attempts to detect transient changes on the grid and use that information as the basis as a probabilistic determination of whether or not the grid has failed or some other condition has resulted in a temporary change

According to Ohms law the voltage in an electrical circuit is a function of electric current the supply of electrons and the applied load resistance In the case of a grid interruption the current being supplied by the local source is unlikely to match the load so perfectly as to be able to maintain a constant voltage A system that periodically samples voltage and looks for sudden changes can be used to detect a fault condition

Underover voltage detection is normally trivial to implement in gridinteractive inverters because the basic function of the inverter is to match the grid conditions including voltage That means that all gridinteractive inverters by necessity have the circuitry needed to detect the changes All that is needed is an algorithm to detect sudden changes However sudden changes in voltage are a common occurrence on the grid as loads are attached and removed so a threshold must be used to avoid false disconnections

The range of conditions that result in nondetection with this method may be large and these systems are generally used along with other detection systems

The frequency of the power being delivered to the grid is a function of the supply one that the inverters carefully match When the grid source is lost the frequency of the power would fall to the natural resonant frequency of the circuits in the island Looking for changes in this frequency like voltage is easy to implement using already required functionality and for this reason almost all inverters also look for fault conditions using this method as well

Unlike changes in voltage it is generally considered highly unlikely that a random circuit would naturally have a natural frequency the same as the grid power However many devices deliberately synchronize to the grid frequency like televisions Motors in particular may be able to provide a signal that is within the NDZ for some time as they wind down The combination of voltage and frequency shifts still results in a NDZ that is not considered adequate by all

In order to decrease the time in which an island is detected rate of change of frequency has been adopted as a detection method The rate of change of frequency is given by the following expression

formula1

where formula2 is the system frequency formula3 is the time formula4 is the power imbalance formula5 formula6 is the system capacity and formula7 is the system inertia

Should the rate of change of frequency or ROCOF value be greater than a certain value the embedded generation will be disconnected from the network

Loads generally have power factors that are not perfect meaning that they do not accept the voltage from the grid perfectly but impede it slightly Gridtie inverters by definition have power factors of 1 This can lead to changes in phase when the grid fails which can be used to detect islanding

Inverters generally track the phase of the grid signal using a phase locked loop PLL of some sort The PLL stays in sync with the grid signal by tracking when the signal crosses zero volts Between those events the system is essentially drawing a sineshaped output varying the current output to the circuit to produce the proper voltage waveform When the grid disconnects the power factor suddenly changes from the grids 1 to the loads 1 As the circuit is still providing a current that would produce a smooth voltage output given the known loads this condition will result in a sudden change in voltage By the time the waveform is completed and returns to zero the signal will be out of phase

The main advantage to this approach is that the shift in phase will occur even if the load exactly matches the supply in terms of Ohms law  the NDZ is based on power factors of the island which are very rarely 1 The downside is that many common events like motors starting also cause phase jumps as new impedances are added to the circuit This forces the system to use relatively large thresholds reducing its effectiveness

Even with noisy sources like motors the total harmonic distortion THD of a gridconnected circuit is generally unmeasurable due to the essentially infinite capacity of the grid that filters these events out Inverters on the other hand generally have much larger distortions as much as 5 THD This is a function of their construction some THD is a natural sideeffect of the switchedmode power supply circuits most inverters are based on

Thus when the grid disconnects the THD of the local circuit will naturally increase to that of the inverters themselves This provides a very secure method of detecting islanding because there are generally no other sources of THD that would match that of the inverter Additionally interactions within the inverters themselves notably the transformers have nonlinear effects that produce unique 2nd and 3rd harmonics that are easily measurable

The drawback of this approach is that some loads may filter out the distortion in the same way that the inverter attempts to If this filtering effect is strong enough it may reduce the THD below the threshold needed to trigger detection Systems without a transformer on the inside of the disconnect point will make detection more difficult However the largest problem is that modern inverters attempt to lower the THD as much as possible in some cases to unmeasurable limits

Active methods generally attempt to detect a grid failure by injecting small signals into the line and then detecting whether or not the signal changes

This method is an active islanding detection method which can be used by threephase electronically coupled distributed generation DG units The method is based on injecting a negativesequence current through the voltagesourced converter VSC controller and detecting and quantifying the corresponding negativesequence voltage at the point of common coupling PCC of the VSC by means of a unified threephase signal processor UTSP The UTSP system is an enhanced phaselocked loop PLL which provides a high degree of immunity to noise and thus enables islanding detection based on injecting a small negativesequence current The negativesequence current is injected by a negativesequence controller which is adopted as the complementary of the conventional VSC current controller The negativesequence current injection method detects an islanding event within 60 ms 35 cycles under UL1741 test conditions requires 2 to 3 negativesequence current injection for islanding detection can correctly detect an islanding event for the grid short circuit ratio of 2 or higher and is insensitive to variations of the load parameters of UL1741 test system 
Impedance Measurement attempts to measure the overall impedance of the circuit being fed by the inverter It does this by slightly forcing the current amplitude through the AC cycle presenting too much current at a given time Normally this would have no effect on the measured voltage as the grid is an effectively infinitely stiff voltage source In the event of a disconnection even the small forcing would result in a noticeable change in voltage allowing detection of the island

The main advantage of this method is that it has a vanishingly small NDZ for any given single inverter However the inverse is also the main weakness of this method in the case of multiple inverters each one would be forcing a slightly different signal into the line hiding the effects on any one inverter It is possible to address this problem by communication between the inverters to ensure they all force on the same schedule but in a nonhomogeneous install multiple installations on a single branch this becomes difficult or impossible in practice Additionally the method only works if the grid is effectively infinite and in practice many realworld grid connections do not sufficiently meet this criterion

Although the methodology is similar to Impedance Measurement this method also known as harmonic amplitude jump is actually closer to Harmonics Detection In this case the inverter deliberately introduces harmonics at a given frequency and as in the case of Impedance Measurement expects the signal from the grid to overwhelm it until the grid fails Like Harmonics Detection the signal may be filtered out by realworld circuits

This is one of the newest methods of islanding detection and in theory one of the best It is based on forcing the phase of the inverters output to be slightly misaligned with the grid with the expectation that the grid will overwhelm this signal The system relies on the actions of a finely tuned phaselocked loop to become unstable when the grid signal is missing in this case the PLL attempts to adjust the signal back to itself which is tuned to continue to drift In the case of grid failure the system will quickly drift away from the design frequency eventually causing the inverter to shut down

The major advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented using circuitry that is already present in the inverter The main disadvantage is that it requires the inverter to always be slightly out of time with the grid a lowered power factor Generally speaking the system has a vanishingly small NDZ and will quickly disconnect but it is known that there are some loads that will react to offset the detection

Frequency bias forces a slightly offfrequency signal into the grid but fixes this at the end of every cycle by jumping back into phase when the voltage passes zero This creates a signal similar to Slip Mode but the power factor remains closer to that of the grids and resets itself every cycle Moreover the signal is less likely to be filtered out by known loads The main disadvantage is that every inverter would have to agree to shift the signal back to zero at the same point on the cycle say as the voltage crosses back to zero otherwise different inverters will force the signal in different directions and filter it out

There are numerous possible variations to this basic scheme The Frequency Jump version also known as the zebra method inserts forcing only on a specific number of cycles in a set pattern This dramatically reduces the chance that external circuits may filter the signal out This advantage disappears with multiple inverters unless some way of synchronizing the patterns is used

The utility also has a variety of methods available to it to force systems offline in the event of a failure

Most small generator connections require a mechanical disconnect switch so at a minimum the utility could send a repairman to pull them all For very large sources one might simply install a dedicated telephone hotline that can be used to have an operator manually shut down the generator In either case the reaction time is likely to be on the order of minutes or hours

Manual disconnection could be automated through the use of signals sent though the grid or on secondary means For instance power line carrier communications could be installed in all inverters periodically checking for signals from the utility and disconnecting either on command or if the signal disappears for a fixed time Such a system would be highly reliable but expensive to implement

As the utility can be reasonably assured that they will always have a method for discovering a fault whether that be automated or simply looking at the recloser it is possible for the utility to use this information and transmit it down the line This can be used to force the tripping of properly equipped DG systems by deliberately opening a series of recloser in the grid to force the DG system to be isolated in a way that forces it out of the NDZ This method can be guaranteed to work but requires the grid to be equipped with automated recloser systems and external communications systems that guarantee the signal will make it through to the reclosers

A related concept is to deliberately force a section of the grid into a condition that will guarantee the DG systems will disconnect This is similar to the transfertrip method but uses active systems at the headend of the utility as opposed to relying on the topology of the network

A simple example is a large bank of capacitors that are added to a branch left charged up and normally disconnected by a switch In the event of a failure the capacitors are switched into the branch by the utility after a short delay This can be easily accomplished through automatic means at the point of distribution The capacitors can only supply current for a brief period ensuring that the start or end of the pulse they deliver will cause enough of a change to trip the inverters

There appears to be no NDZ for this method of antiislanding Its main disadvantage is cost the capacitor bank has to be large enough to cause changes in voltage that will be detected and this is a function of the amount of load on the branch In theory very large banks would be needed an expense the utility is unlikely to look on favourably

Antiislanding protection can be improved through the use of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA systems already widely used in the utility market For instance an alarm could sound if the SCADA system detects voltage on a line where a failure is known to be in progress This does not affect the antiislanding systems but may allow any of the systems noted above to be quickly implemented

Rolf de Mar
Rolf de Mar 9 May 1888  28 April 1964 sometimes called Rolf de Mare was a Swedish art collector and leader of the Ballets Sudois in Paris in 192025 In 1933 he founded the worlds first museum for dance in Paris

Rolf de Mar was born in Stockholm in 1888 as the son of diplomat Henrik de Mar and sculptor Ellen Roosval von Hallwyl In 1913 he made friends with postimpressionist painter Nils von Dardel who was not particularly well off but imaginative and talented while de Mar was enthusiastic and had money 

In 1918 through Dardel de Mar met Jean Brlin and de Mar became lover and protector of the Swedish dancer

Together with Dardel he created in 1920 the Ballets Sudois at the Thtre des Champslyses in Paris of which Brlin was first dancer and choreographer In the autumn of 1924 Giorgio de Chirico curated the scenography and costumes for Pirandellos La Giara

Brlin died in 1930 and in 1933 de Mar founded Les Archives internationales de la Danse AID in Paris in his memory the worlds first museum and research institute for dance The Archive became a famous centre for studies in dance and visitors came from all over the world to see exhibitions or to study in its vast library The dance center also published its own magazine and books arranged lecture demonstrations in the building which de Mar had constructed for his dance centre

After the World War the archives had grown too large for a private person to maintain de Mar closed his business in Paris and donated parts of the collections  some 6000 books engravings and other items all concerned mainly with Western dance  to the French government which placed them at the museum and library of the Paris Opera However the museum declined to accept two substantial elements of de Mars collection firstly material from the Ballets Sudois and secondly the fruits of his expedition of exploration to Indonesia in 1936  the first to have been undertaken with the purpose of documenting dance

Therefore the collection from the Swedish Ballet in Paris and the nonEuropean collections were brought by de Mar to Stockholm to form the Dance Museum which he opened in 1953 in the basement of the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm On his death he made the Dance Museum the sole heir to his fortune and this enabled the museum to make further acquisitions

After dissolving the Ballets Suedois in 1925 de Mar made no attempt to revive its works The various concrete collectibles de Mar amassed and that exist today as the bedrock of Stockholms Dance Museum illuminate our picture of him as archivist and art collector all the while they question his role as a connoisseur of a theater based on the art of dancing Throughout his life Rolf de Mar was also a distinguished art collector In the early 1960s he made an important donation of modernist art to the Moderna Museet Rolf de Mar died of a stroke in Barcelona in 1964

The Heart of the Matter film
The Heart of the Matter is a 1953 British film based on the 1948 book of the same name by Graham Greene It was directed by George More OFerrall for London Films It was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival

Trevor Howard plays Scobie a senior policeman in British Sierra Leone He is unhappily married to Louise played by Elizabeth Allan While she is away he begins a love affair with Helen played by Maria Schell However Scobies Catholic faith leaves him tormented with guilt The film also features Denholm Elliott Peter Finch Grard Oury George Coulouris and Michael Hordern

It contains no original score but instead features indigenous music from Sierra Leone in West Africa where location filming took place The interiors were filmed at Shepperton Studios in London The black and white cinematography was by Jack Hildyard

Scobie Deputy Commissioner of the Sierra Leone Police in Freetown during the Second World War is unhappily married to fellowCatholic Louise and both mourn their only daughter Despite his having been a police officer in the country for 15 years when the Police Commissioner announces he is to retire Scobie is not chosen to replace him but rather a younger man is being sent out from England

On a search of a visiting Portuguese ship the neutral vessel Esperana he finds an envelope addressed to Germany When he confiscates it the captain begs him to do nothing because the letter is to his daughter Feeling pity Scobie burns it His wife keeps begging him to let her go to South Africa but they cannot afford the fare Eventually he accepts a loan from Yusef a suspected smuggler to send her away by sea

Called up country because a local District Commissioner is in trouble he finds the man has committed suicide because of his debts to smugglers While he is there survivors of a ship torpedoed by the Germans are brought ashore by the Vichy police of neighbouring French Guinea One he notices is Helen a very young widow who reminds him of his dead daughter Back in Freetown he finds she has been given a hut near his house and after he pays her a visit the two start an affair When he learns that Louise is coming back on the next voyage of the Esperana he writes Helen a note It never reaches her because it is intercepted by a servant in Yusefs pay

Yusef then tells Scobie that he must give a packet of contraband diamonds to the captain of the Esperana or face ruin Complying he returns home and at a party to welcome Helen to the district he learns that Louise will shortly return home and that they will be unable to continue their affair Louise then forces Scobie to attend mass and take communion which damns him because he had not confessed his sins of adultery and corruption Unable to keep the woman he loves and liable to lose his job at any moment he prepares to commit suicide but instead is distracted by a violent altercation between some criminals and is fatally injured in the skirmish dying in his servants arms

The main difference between the film and the book is in the ending which is almost equally bleak but reversed from Greenes original story In the book Scobies servant is killed apparently an act of revenge by Yusef here played by Grard Oury Scobie commits suicide In the film Scobie intends to kill himself but is interrupted by a fight breaking out He intervenes and is shot The servant Earl Cameron does not die but instead Scobie dies in his servants arms

European settlement began in the Tintaldra in 1837 with the arrival of squatters looking for fresh grass and water for cattle The town began to form around 1854 as unlucky prospectors began to look for land to farm though of insufficient size to justify a Post Office until 1 January 1867

Its location as a crossing point over the Murray River and its associated customs house led to a boom period in the late 19th century Federation and the development of other river crossings into New South Wales led to a slow decline Soldier settlers moved to the area after World War I Much of Tintaldra was burnt to the ground in the Black Friday bushfires of 13 January 1939

Tintaldras economy is based around agriculture and tourism The Tintaldra store constructed in 1864 with rough hewn River Red Gum beams and rafters and walls made from vertical slats of Stringybark timber is still standing today Nearby BurrowaPine Mountain National Park is a popular place for bushwalking and camping

Browns thinking on the decline of sovereignty and the hollowing out of democracy has found popular and journalistic audiences with discussions of her work appearing in The New York Times The Washington Post and The Guardian Brown has appeared in documentary films including The Value of the Humanities 2014 and What is Democracy directed by Astra Taylor 2018

Together with Michel Feher Brown is coeditor of the Zone Books series Near Futures and its digital supplement Near Futures Online

Brown has established new paradigms in critical legal studies and feminist theory She has produced a body of work drawing from Karl Marxs critique of capitalism and its relation to religion and secularism Friedrich Nietzsches usefulness for thinking about power and the ruses of morality Max Weber on the modern organization of power psychoanalysis and its implications for political identification Michel Foucaults work on governmentality and neoliberalism as well as other contemporary continental philosophers Bringing these resources together with her own thinking on a range of topics Browns work aims to diagnose modern and contemporary formations of political power and to discern the threats to democracy entailed by such formations

In this work Brown asks how a sense of woundedness can become the basis for individual and collective forms of identity From outlawing hate speech to banning pornography Brown argues wellintentioned attempts at protection can legitimize the state while harming subjects by codifying their identities as helpless or in need of continuous governmental regulation While breaking ground in political theory this work also represents one of Browns key interventions in feminist and queer theory The book offers a novel account of legal and political power as constitutive of norms of sexuality and gender Through the concept of wounded attachments Brown contends that psychic injury may accompany and sustain racial ethnic and gender categories particularly in relation to state law and discursive formations In this and other works Brown has criticized representatives of second wave feminism such as Catharine MacKinnon for reinscribing the category of woman as an essentialized identity premised on injury

This book comprises a series of essays on contemporary political issues from the problem of moralism in politics to the legacies of past injustices in the present Throughout her thematically overlapping chapters Brown asks What happens to left and liberal political orientations when faith in progress is broken when both the sovereign individual and sovereign states seem tenuous when desire seems as likely to seek punishment as freedom when all political conviction is revealed as contingent and subjective Much of this book takes history and liberalism themselves as objects of theoretical reflection and sites of contestation Drawing on a range of thinkers such as Freud Marx Nietzsche Spinoza Benjamin and Derrida Brown rethinks the disorientation and possibility inherent to contemporary democracy

This work consists of seven articles responding to particular occasions each of which mimic in certain ways the experience of the political realm one is challenged to think here now about a problem that is set and framed by someone else and to do so before a particular audience or in dialogue with others not of ones own choosing Each individual essay begins with a specific problem what is the relationship between love loyalty and dissent in contemporary American political life how did neoliberal rationality become a form of governmentality what are the main problems of womens studies programs and so on According to Brown the essays do not aim to definitively answer the given questions but to critically interrogate the framing and naming practices challenge the dogmas including those of the Left and of feminism and discern the constitutive powers shaping the problem at hand

In this book Brown subverts the usual and widely accepted notion that tolerance is one of the most remarkable achievements of Western modernity She suggests that tolerance or toleration cannot be perceived as the complete opposite to violence At times it can also be used to justify violence Brown argues that tolerance primarily operates as a discourse of subject construction and a mode of governmentality that addresses or confirms asymmetric relations between different groups each of which must then tolerate other groups and categories or be tolerated by the dominant groups and categories

To substantiate her thesis Brown examines the tolerance discourse of figures like George W Bush Jimmy Carter Samuel Huntington Susan Okin Michael Ignatieff Bernard Lewis and Seyla Benhabib and argues that tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant it is always a certain expression of domination even as it offers protection or incorporation to the less powerful Among those influenced by Browns thinking on this subject are Joan Wallach Scott and Slavoj iek whose respective works The Politics of the Veil 2007 and Violence Six Sideways Reflections 2007 draw heavily on Browns account of tolerance discourse

In a debate with Rainer Forst at the ICI in Berlin Brown addressed this problematic again later published as a coauthored book The Power of Tolerance 2014 Here Brown argues against primarily moral or normative approaches to power and discourse and warns against the dangers of uncritically celebrating the liberal ideal of tolerance as frequently happens in Western notions of historical civilizational or moral progress

Published exclusively in French Les habits neufs de la politique mondiale The New Clothes of World Politics argues that the following political fact is irreversible liberal democracy as a global social and historical modality of statecraft is dying The two movements delivering such blows neoliberalism and neoconservatism feature both resonances and disonances Brown argues that whilst the former acts as a political rationality a mode of general regulation of behavior the latter is both necessary to its survival and parasitic of its survival As a form of governmentality that redefines freedom neoliberalism will moralize politics limiting its scope this is the function of neoconservatism

This book examines the revival of wallbuilding under shifting conditions of global capitalism Brown not only problematizes the assumed functions of walls such as the prevention of crime migration smuggling and so on She also argues that walling has taken on new a significance due to its symbolic function in an increasingly globalized and precarious world of financial capital As individual identity as well as nationstate sovereignty are threatened walls become objects invested with individual and collective desire Anxious efforts to shore up national identity are thus projected onto borders as well as new material structures that would appear to secure them The book was reprinted with a new preface by the author following the 2016 election of Donald Trump

Browns study begins by engaging and revising key arguments in Foucaults The Birth of Biopolitics with the aim of analyzing different ways that democracy is being hollowed out by neoliberal rationality She describes neoliberalism as a thoroughgoing attack on the most foundational ideas and practices of democracy The individual chapters of the book examine the effects of neoliberalization on higher education law governance the basic principles of liberal democratic institutions as well as radical democratic imaginaries

Brown treats neoliberalism as a governing rationality through which everything is economized and in a very specific way human beings become market actors and nothing but every field of activity is seen as a market and every entity whether public or private whether person business or state is governed as a firm To address such threats Brown argues democracy must be reinvigorated not only as an object of theoretical inquiry but also as a site of political struggle

Browns latest book is forthcoming with Columbia University Press in 2019

A prominent public intellectual in the United States Brown has written and spoken about issues of free speech public education political protest LGBTQ issues sexual assault Donald Trump conservatism neoliberalism and other matters of national and international concern

For decades Brown has been active in efforts to resist measures toward the privatization of the University of California system In her capacity as cochair of the Berkeley Faculty Association she raised awareness organized marches and spoke publicly about the privatization of public education She has been critical of the universitys decision to cut costs by utilizing lecturers rather than hiring tenure and tenure track professors Relatedly she has voiced concern over the perils of the UCs proposed online education programs

Brown has criticized university administration for their response to sexual assault I think many faculty feel there are repeat harassers on our faculty who are never charged  Graduate students gave up on careers and these perpetrators were allowed to continue and that was wrongnever should have happened she said

At the 99 Mile March to Sacramento she addressed her criticism to more general trends We are marching to draw attention to the plight of public education in California and to implore Californians to reinvest in it For all its resources innovation and wealth California has sunk to nearly the bottom of the nation in per student spending and our public higher education system once the envy of the world is in real peril Brown supported Occupy Wall Street as part of the UC faculty council claiming that We understand this to be part of what the movement stands for We are delighted by the protests and consider our campaign to be at one with it

Brown is a native of California and lives in Berkeley with her wife Judith Butler and son

<doc id="7739305" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739305" title="Models of abnormality">
Models of abnormality
Models of abnormality are general hypotheses as to the nature of psychological abnormalities The four main models to explain psychological abnormality are the biological behavioural cognitive and psychodynamic models They all attempt to explain the causes and treatments for all psychological illnesses and all from a different approach

The biological model of abnormality the only model not based on psychological principles is based on the assumptions that if the brain neuroanatomy and related biochemicals are all physical entities and work together to mediate psychological processes then treating any mental abnormality must be physicalbiological Part of this theory stems from much research into the major neurotransmitter serotonin which seems to show that major psychological illnesses such as bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa are caused by abnormally reduced levels of Serotonin in the brain1 The model also suggests that psychological illness could and should be treated like any physical illness being caused by chemical imbalance microbes or physical stress and hence can be treated with surgery or drugs Electroconvulsive therapy has also proved to be a successful shortterm treatment for depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder and related illnesses although the reasons for its success are almost completely unknown There is also evidence for a genetic factor in causing psychological illness23 The main cures for psychological illness under this model electroconvulsive therapy drugs and surgery at times can have very good results in restoring normality as biology has been shown to play some sort of role in psychological illness However they can also have consequences whether biology is responsible or not as drugs always have a chance of causing allergic reactions or addiction Electrotherapy can cause unnecessary stress and surgery can dull the personality as the part of the brain responsible for emotion hypothalamus is often altered or even completely removed

A diagnosis of mental illness implies that a person is in no way responsible for the abnormality of functioning and as such is not to blame The concept of no blame is generally thought to be more humane and likely to elicit a much more sympathetic response from others

However Zarate 1972 pointed out that even more than physical illness mental illness is something that people fear  largely because it is something they do not understand In general people do not know how to respond to someone diagnosed as mentally ill There may also be fears that the persons behaviour might be unpredictable or potentially dangerous Therefore sympathy is more likely to give way to avoidance of the person which in turn leads to the person feeling shunned
A huge amount of research has been carried out within the framework of the medical model and this has greatly increased our understanding of the possible biological factors underpinning psychological disorders However much of the evidence is inconclusive and findings can be difficult to interpret For example in family studies it is difficult to disentangle the effects of genetics from the effects of environment It can also be difficult to establish cause and effect For example raised levels of dopamine may be a consequence rather than a cause of schizophrenia

Many psychologists criticise psychiatry for focusing its attention primarily on symptoms and for assuming that relieving symptoms with drugs cures the problem Unfortunately in many cases when the drug treatment is ceased the symptoms recur This suggests that drugs are not addressing the true cause of the problem

The behavioural model to abnormality assumes that all maladaptive behaviour is essentially acquired through ones environment Therefore psychiatrists practising the beliefs of this model would be to prioritise changing the behaviour over identifying the cause of the dysfunctional behaviour The main solution to psychological illness under this model is aversion therapy where the stimulus that provokes the dysfunctional behaviour is coupled with a second stimulus with aims to produce a new reaction to the first stimulus based on the experiences of the second Also systematic desensitisation can be used especially where phobias are involved by using the phobia that currently causes the dysfunctional behaviour and coupling it with a phobia that produces a more intense reaction This is meant to make the first phobia seem less fearsome etc as it has been put in comparison with the second phobia This model seems to have been quite successful where phobias and compulsive disorders are concerned but it doesnt focus on the cause of the illness or problem and so risks recurrence of the problem

The behavioural model overcomes the ethical issues raised by the medical model of labelling someone as ill or abnormal Instead the model concentrates on behaviour and whether it is adaptive or maladaptive The model also allows individual and cultural differences to be taken into account Provided the behaviour is presenting no problems to the individual or to other people then there is no need to regard the behaviour as a mental disorder Those who support the psychodynamic model however claim the behavioural model focuses only on symptoms and ignores the causes of abnormal behaviour They claim that the symptoms are merely the tip of the iceberg  the outward expression of deeper underlying emotional problems Whenever symptoms are treated without any attempt to ascertain the deeper underlying problems then the problem will only manifest itself in another way through different symptoms This is known as symptom substitution Behaviourists reject this criticism and claim that we need not look beyond the behavioural symptoms as the symptoms are the disorder Thus there is nothing to be gained from searching for internal causes either psychological or physical Behaviourists point to the success of behavioural therapies in treating certain disorders Others note the effects of such treatments are not always long lasting Another criticism of the behavioural model are the ethical issues it raises Some claim the therapies are dehumanising and unethical For example aversion therapy has been imposed on people without consent

The cognitive model of abnormality focuses on the cognitive distortions or the dysfunctions in the thought processes and the cognitive deficiencies particularly the absence of sufficient thinking and planning This model holds that these variables are the cause of many psychological disorders and that psychologists following this outlook explain abnormality in terms of irrational and negative thinking with the main position that thinking determines all behaviour 

The cognitive model of abnormality is one of the dominant forces in academic psychology beginning in the 1970s and its appeal is partly attributed to the way it emphasizes the evaluation of internal mental processes such as perception attention memory and problemsolving The process allows psychologists to explain the development of mental disorders and the link between cognition and brain function especially to develop therapeutic techniques and interventions 

When it comes to the treatment of abnormal behavior or mental disorder the cognitive model is quite similar to the behavioural model but with the main difference that instead of teaching the patient to behave differently it teaches the patient to think differently It is hoped that if the patients feelings and emotions towards something are influenced to change it will induce external behavioural change Though similar in ways to the behavioural model psychiatrists of this model use differing methods for cures One key assumption in cognitive therapy is that treatment should include helping people restructure their thoughts so that they think more positively about themselves their life and their future 

One of the main treatments is rational emotive therapy RET which is based on the principle that an activating emotional event will cause a change in thoughts toward that situation even if it is an illogical thought So with this therapy it is the psychiatrists job to question and change the irrational thoughts It is similar to the behavioural model where its success is concerned as it has also proved to be quite successful in the treatment of compulsive disorders and phobias Although it does not deal with the cause of the problem directly it does attempt to change the situation more broadly than the behavioural model Due to their respective characteristics and similarities there are instances when psychologists combine cognitive and behavioural models to treat mental disorders

The psychodynamic model is the fourth psychological model of abnormality and is based on the work of Sigmund Freud It is based on the principles that psychological illnesses come about from repressed emotions and thoughts from experiences in the past usually childhood and as a result of this repression alternative behaviour replaces what is being repressed The patient is believed to be cured when they can admit that which is currently being repressed 4 The main cure for illnesses under this model is free association where the patient is free to speak while the psychiatrist notes down and tries to interpret where the trouble areas are This model can be successful especially where the patient feels comfortable to speak freely and about issues that are relevant to a cure

Rouen duck
The Rouen is a heavyweight breed of domesticated duck raised primarily for decoration exhibition or as general purpose ducks since they are not prolific egg layers Rouen ducks are frequently used for meat The breed originated in France sometime before the 19th century

The plumage coloring of both the Rouen drake and the Rouen duck are nearly identical to that of the Mallard drake and Mallard duck The Mallard color pattern is referred to as gray Males have green heads white collars black tail coverts and dark ashy brown tail feathers a gray body and a deep claret breast The female Rouen hens are a consistent shade of mahogany brown with a brown crown and tan eyestripes extending from bill to the back of the eyes Another feature of the female color pattern is the distinct detailed penciling found on feathers of the head neck body body most of the wing and tail Rouen females can be much darker brown than Mallard females Both sexes also have blue speculum feathers However Rouen speculum feathers are brighter in color and larger in size than that of the Mallard Adult Rouen ducks are typically significantly larger than Mallard ducks The Rouen duckling is identical to the Mallard duckling in terms of plumage coloring In North America two distinct types are bred the common or productionbred variety that is larger than a Mallard but has a typical duck conformation and the much larger and squarer standardbred variety The production variety normally weighs 68lbs 2736kg while the standardbred weighs 912lb 4154kg

Rouen ducklings can be distinguished from wild mallard ducklings by the presence of a second stripe which runs across their face just under their eye whereas mallard ducklings have only one stripe which runs across their eye

The breed was first raised in France but it was not until it reached England in the 19th century that it was refined into the breed recognized as the Rouen today The French version resembled a larger than average Mallard but by selective breeding the British developed the exhibitiontype Rouen The final product was a bird with a deep long keel boatshaped profile enormous appearance and refined markings especially the penciling on the female It was used chiefly as a roasting bird though it produced 35 to 125 eggs a year there were other breeds which were more reliable egglayers with higher production The eggs are typically white but can have blue and green tints Exhibitiontyped Rouen ducks have been known to crush their eggs if allowed to set due to their massive frames In 1861 Mrs Beeton said of it

The origin of the name is not known When they arrived in England they were variously called Rhne after the region in southwestcentral France Rohan after the cardinal of that name Roan for the mixture of colours and Rouen after the northern French town with Rouen eventually being adopted in both England and France In France they are called Rouen Fonc dark as opposed to Rouen Clair which are lighter in colour

In 1850 the first Rouens were introduced to the United States by D W Lincoln of Worcester Massachusetts and used as general farm ducks until becoming popular as show birds They were included in the Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874 and since then have won many titles often having the most entries in the heavyweight class and doing well in competition with other breeds

Camila OGorman
Maria Camila OGorman Ximnez 18271828  18 August 1848 was a 19th century Argentine socialite executed over a scandal involving her relationship with a Roman Catholic priest She was 20 years old and eight months pregnant when she and Father Ladislao Gutirrez faced a firing squad

Camila was born in Merced Buenos Aires the youngest daughter of Adolfo OGorman y Perichn Vandeuil and his wife Joaquina Ximnez Pinto She was the secondtolast of six children in an upperclass family of mixed Irish French and Spanish descent Typical of powerful families in Argentinas postcolonial era two of her brothers went on to pursue reputable careers One as an ordained priest of the Jesuit Order and the other as a police officer and the eventual founder of the Buenos Aires Police Academy

She was also the granddaughter of Ana Prichon de OGorman 17761847 renowned lover of the Viceroy of the La Plata Santiago de Liniers First Count of Buenos Aires As the first British invasion occurred Liniers was part of the defence of Buenos Aires For heroic actions in defence of the city Santiago de Liniers was appointed Military Governor of Buenos Aires and Perichon de OGorman became the unofficial first lady Her importance and power led to accusations intended to discredit her including allegations that she was a spy for the French or the English After Liniers died in 1810 she retired to a quieter life with her sons and died peacefully in 1847 at the age of 72

In 1847 Argentina was governed by Juan Manuel de Rosas a General of the Argentine Army and a politician Rosas governed the Argentine Confederation by decree from 182952 Camila was considered a pillar of polite society a close friend and confidante of Rosas daughter Manuelita and a frequent guest at the Governors Residence In her late teens Camila was introduced to Father Ladislao Gutirrez a Jesuit priest who had attended seminary with her brother 

At the time the Society of Jesus was the only institution within Argentinas Catholic Church which continued to speak out against Rosas police state tactics This led Rosas to later banish the Jesuits from Argentina Father Gutirrez came from a similar background his uncle was the Provincial Governor of Tucumn  Father Gutirrez had been assigned as the parish priest of Nuestra Seora del Socorro Our Lady of Relief and was frequently invited to the OGorman familys estate They soon began a clandestine affair

They escaped in December 1847 and settled in Goya Corrientes Province where they set up the towns first school and posed as a married couple under false names Corrientes was at the time under the control of Benjamn Virasoro a warlord hostile to Rosas As the scandal broke Adolfo OGorman sent a letter to Rosas accusing Gutierrez of having seduced Camila under the guise of religion Adolfo described himself and his family as heartbroken and pleaded that his daughter be rescued from the man he accused of having kidnapped her

Rosas exiled political opponents and future President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento declared that Rosas was responsible for the moral corruption of Argentine womanhood Camila and Ladislao were recognised by an Irish priest Fr Michael Gannon Among others Father Anthony Fahy and lawyer Dalmacio Vlez Sarsfield demanded an exemplary punishment of the wayward daughter that was also giving the industrious and wellregarded Irish community a bad name 

The couple was abducted from Corrientes Province and returned to Buenos Aires Camila claimed she had initiated her relationship with Gutierrez and insisted on their elopement angrily denying rumors that she had been raped From Buenos Aires Rosas had given strict orders  the fugitives were to be sent to the prison of Santos Lugares today San Andrs General San Martn Buenos Aires Province in separate carriages  as indicated by Foreign Relations Minister Felipe Arana in his warrant of arrest

Before reaching their final destination Camila wrote to Manuelita Rosas with the hope that she might persuade her father into granting clemency Manuelita replied to her friends letter promising to help Manuelita optimistically furnished a cell in a nearby Convent with a piano and books However Rosas denied his daughters pleas and replied that this case needs a show of my undisputed power as the moral values and sacred religious norms of a whole society are at stake At the time Rosas had removed the administration of justice from the courts and taken it upon himself As per protocol he signed a decree ordering the executions

Immediately after arriving to the prison according to Canon Law Father Castellanos the prison chaplain visited Camilas cell and baptised her unborn baby This consisted of Camila drinking holy water and placing consecrated ashes on her forehead The next morning 18 August 1848 OGorman and Gutirrez were taken to the courtyard tied to chairs and blindfolded Rosas accepted full responsibility for the execution and said nobody had made any plea on behalf of the couple overlooking the pleas of his own daughter Manuelita Many documents have survived including a letter from Adolfo OGorman to Rosas demanding exemplary punishment for the most atrocious and unheard of event in this country

A book published in 1883 many years after the event by Antonino Reyes who had served Rosas for 14 years and was his aidedecamp secretary Sergeant Major and Chief of Police at Santos Lugares Prison Reyes was so moved that he decided not to witness the executions and out of compassion ordered both bodies to be placed in the same coffin Only then did he write to Rosas and inform him that his orders had been carried out In the aftermath of their deaths both friends and enemies of Rosas claimed to be appalled by the cruel and senseless execution including Sarmiento and his fellow Unitarios and wrote about it using terms such as the beautiful girl the doomed couple and the repression of love Camila was 20 years old and eight months pregnant with an illegitimate child Father Gutirrez was 24 years old

<doc id="7739419" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7739419" title="Control track">
Control track
A control track is a track that runs along an outside edge of a standard analog videotape including VHS The control track encodes a series of pulses each pulse corresponding to the beginning of each frame This allows the video tape player to synchronize its scan speed and tape speed to the speed of the recording Thus the recorded control track defines the speed of playback eg SP LP EP etc and it is also what drives the relative counter clock that most VCRs have

The control track is used to finetune the tape speed during playback so that the high speed rotating heads remained exactly on their helical tracks rather than somewhere between two adjacent tracks known as tracking Since good tracking depends on precise distances between the rotating drum and the fixed controlaudio head reading the linear tracks which usually varies by a couple of micrometers between machines due to manufacturing tolerances most VCRs offer tracking adjustment either manual or automatic to correct such mismatches

The control track is also used to hold index marks which were normally written at the beginning of each recording session and can be found using the VCRs index search function this will fastwind forward or backward to the nth specified index mark and resume playback from there At times higherend VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks  so that for example they coincide with the actual start of the television program  but this feature later became hard to find

By the late 1990s some highend VCRs offered more sophisticated indexing For example Panasonics Tape Library system assigned an ID number to each cassette and logged recording information channel date time and optional program title entered by the user both on the cassette and in the VCRs memory for up to 900 recordings 600 with titles

A gap in the control track signal of a videotape usually causes a flaw during playback as the player may lose tracking as soon as the track drops out This usually leads to a gap in video and audio since theres no information as to what speed the media is recorded at the VCRs counter will freeze and upon reacquiring the control track the video sync will be momentarily lost

Problems with control track signals are almost always caused by a gap in recording eg a recording was resumed beyond rather than at the point where recording was previously stopped A control track error can also be caused by a dropout  a defect in the magnetic particles on a tape  but this is very uncommon as the control track is immune to all but the most severe tape damage

A discontinuous control track was and still is especially problematic for analog videotape editing Each gap in the control track no matter how brief destroys synchronization and continuity which can make a segment of a recorded video difficult or impossible to use for editing

The acronym LOCT pronounced locked used by many video professionals can mean Loss Of Control Track andor Loss Of Continuous Timecode Though either type of loss can pose similar problems and both issues are sometimes directly related control track and timecode are two different things see timecode

Control track problems cannot be repaired You can duplicate the tape to restore control track continuity but this will not fix visual and audible glitches caused by gaps in the original control track and the video itself will suffer quality degradation due to generation loss

For this reason many video professionals would prestripe every analog videotape to be used in the field or studio beforehand to help ensure good control track throughout This was done by prerecording black to the entire videotape Prestriping also facilitated spotchecking for dropouts on the video portion of the tape usually seen as brief white horizontal dashes before use

Christiana Mariana von Ziegler
Christiana Mariana von Ziegler 28 June 1695  1 May 1760 was a German poet and writer She is best known for the texts of nine cantatas which Johann Sebastian Bach composed after Easter of 1725

Christiana Mariana Romanus was born in Leipzig where her father served as mayor in 1701 She began her literary career after the death of her second husband Captain von Ziegler in 1722 She returned to Leipzig where she lived in the family home the Romanushaus with her mother Her father had received a longterm prison sentence for financial irregularities Despite the difficult family circumstances the house became a literary and musical salon Johann Christoph Gottsched encouraged her poetic activity She became the first woman member of Gottscheds literary society the Deutsche Gesellschaft

In 1741 she married for the third time and her literary activity ceased

She died in Frankfurt an der Oder

Bach moved to Leipzig in 1723 to take up the post of Thomaskantor In this role he set about composing a large number of cantatas for performance in the citys churches There is some uncertainty about who was writing Bachs libretti in his first couple of years in Leipzig 
Whoever his original librettist was Bach appears to have been looking for a new librettist in 1724 and this may be when he met Ziegler
The nine cantatas set by Bach to texts by Ziegler are


The question arises why Bach turned to other librettists There were still texts by Ziegler unset She published a cyle of cantata texts in 1728 the texts set by Bach and others not set by him
John Eliot Gardiner suggests that the relationship between the two may have been strained by Bachs habit of amending her texts to suit his purposes There also seem to be some examples of lack of communication when Bach sets Zieglers words by adapting music he had composed earlier as for example in Er rufet seinen Schafen mit Namen BWV 175

Synch roll
A synch roll or sync roll is a phenomenon that occurs when the synchronization between the recording head and the video encoded on the tape is lost and gradually resynchronized It usually occurs when there is a gap drop out or misalignment of the videotape control track that is used to tell the VCR or VTR where the beginning of each frame begins When the control track suddenly reappears the head may already be in the middle of reading a frame of video in which case the speed adjusts to synchronize with the video on the tape causing a vertical rolling or scrolling of the picture on the television

Henk Feldmeijer
Johannes Hendrik Feldmeijer Assen 30 November 1910  near Raalte 22 February 1945 was a Dutch National Socialist politician and a member of the NSB

He was born in Assen on 30 November 1910 as Johannes Hendrik Veldmeijer In 1915 his familys name was changed to Feldmeijer He used only his middle name making him Henk Feldmeijer He graduated from high school in 1928 with top grades in every subject and started studying mathematics and physics He interrupted his education to perform national service in 1931 During this period he met a leader of the recently established Stormtroopers of the National Socialist Movement NSB He was inspired by the ideas of this movement to become member number 479 in 1932 As one of the first 1000 members he had direct access to the movements leader Anton Mussert He made many speeches in and around Groningen about the need of a strong leader Mussert and against democracy His speaking talents were quickly recognized and he got a paid position in the propaganda department He made many journeys to Nazi Germany during which he had meetings with SS members he also visited Scandinavia and Mussolinis Italy After failing his exams in 1935 he broke off his education and became a fulltime employee of the NSB stationed in Utrecht Because of his membership in the NSB he was fired as a reserveofficer of the army in 1935

Feldmeijer belonged to the volkisch group in the NSB just like Meinoud Rost van Tonningen This group tried to cultivate the Germanic part of Dutch history and promoted a racist and antisemitic view Feldmeijer had many secret contacts in German SS circles of which his NSB superiors were not aware The Volkisch group in the NSB caused a radicalisation of the partys viewpoints They idealised the lives of the Germanic forefathers of the Dutch people and the proponents of these theories performed much research on these ideas 

In 1937 Feldmeijer became an important member of the organisation Der Vaderen Erfdeel Heritage of our forefathers renamed Volksche Werkgemeenschap Volkisch working community in 1940 This group performed the research for the Volkisch group in the NSB The Dutch people had to learn to realise that their culture was a Germanic culture an important step in the direction of the SS way of thinking Feldmeijer was strongly attracted to the SS ideology but had to keep his ties with this organisation a secret as the NSB did not fully appreciate this 

In the autumn of 1937 he was forced to leave the headquarters of the NSB in Utrecht because of a conflict with the NSB leader Anton Mussert and was made the district leader of Salland In August 1939 Rost van Tonningen appointed him as commander of the Mussert guards Feldmeijer based the organisation of this paramilitary group of several hundred men on the SS organisation in Germany In 1939 he made several trips to Berlin to advise the Germans on the Dutch language transmissions of RadioBremen On 3 May 1940 the Dutch government imprisoned him in Fort Ooltgensplaat where he shared a cell with Rost van Tonningen He was later transported to France via Belgium and on 30 May 1940 he was liberated by German troops in Calais On 2 June 1940 Feldmeijer and Rost van Tonningen arrived back in Den Haag That same night Rost van Tonningen was invited to a meeting with Heinrich Himmler and Artur SeyssInquart to discuss the nazification of the Netherlands and the establishment of a Dutch SS A few days later Rost van Tonningen introduced Feldmeijer to Hanns Albin Rauter the German head of the Dutch occupied territories police who was impressed with the vigour and charisma of the young Dutchman

Feldmeijer was tasked with establishing and commanding the Nederlandsche SS Mussert had opposed the creation of the SS in the Netherlands but German pressure had made him agree to its establishment De Nederlandsche SS had a maximum membership of 4000 on 1 November 1942 It always had a double standard as it was seen as part of the NSB and at the same time part of the German SS In theory it was under the leadership of Anton Mussert but in reality Feldmeijer reported to Himmler and his representative in the Netherlands Hanns Albin Rauter Feldmeijer stimulated his members to contribute actively to the German war effort he himself served at the front twice AprilMay 1941 as a gunner in the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler in Yugoslavia and Greece and June 1942  March 1943 as Flak commander in SSDivision Wiking at the Eastern Front in Southern Russia In March 1943 he was promoted to Standartenfhrer in the Allgemeine SS and in March 1944 after completion of an officer training course he was promoted to Hauptsturmfhrer in the WaffenSS He was decorated with the Iron Cross 2nd Class the Sturmabzeichen and the Verwundetenabzeichen in black

Feldmeijer had many conflicts with other members of the NSB because of his strong dedication to the SS The SS wanted a complete integration of the Netherlands in the Greater German Reich On the other hand Mussert wanted a German League of Nations with Germany as a leading member of the European union of states The German occupation authorities saw in Feldmeijer a willing tool to keep Musserts ambitions in check The conflict between the SS and the NSB came to a boil in May 1943 and while Feldmeijer and Mussert made a public appearance together to show their good relations in practice all ties between the NSB and the German SS were severed

Feldmeijer supported the retaliatory measures taken against the resistance actions against NSB members He was a member of the SonderkommandoFeldmeijer between September 1943 and September 1944 and executed at least 20 people for resistance activities in an operation named Silbertanne Aktion Other prominent members of the commando were Heinrich Boere and Klaas Carel Faber and his brother In February 1945 he was appointed to command a battalion of the Landstorm Nederland 

While driving to his position at the front his car was strafed by an Allied fighter plane and Feldmeijer was killed He was buried in Haren several days later Himmler sent Rauter a telegram after hearing of the death of Feldmeijer

I am very sad over the death of Feldmeijer Please convey my condolences to his wife Feldmeijer was the future of Holland in my eyes Dont bother to offer my condolences to Mister Mussert as he never knew what kind of man he had in Feldmeijer

Trent Knobel
Trent Knobel born 23 May 1980 is a former Australian rules footballer in the Australian Football League

Knobel a ruckman originally from the Gold Coast was recruited to the AFL in his home state with the Brisbane Lions onto their rookie list He made his debut in 2000 after a rookie elevation After getting his chance in Round 14 Knobel held his spot for much of the season and played in two finals matches

After a disappointing 2001 season and with the Lions having an abundance of ruck stocks Keating McLaren McDonald Macdonald among others they traded him to St Kilda 

After fairly limited seasons with the Saints in 2002 and 2003 his 2004 season was much improved playing all 24 games and becoming the Saints number one ruckman Despite his crash and bash ruckwork and tally of 460 hitouts for the year he was criticised for his lack of around the ground work averaging just 6 disposals in 2004

This led to him being traded in the 2005 preseason draft to the Richmond Football Club In 2005 he missed 3 games late in the year with a hamstring injury but performed better around the ground

In 2006 Knobel played just 3 games and found it hard for selection due to the form of AllAustralian ruckman Troy Simmonds Due to ongoing injury concerns Knobel was unable to play a senior game in 2007 and announced his retirement from AFL football on 28 August 2007

After his AFL retirement Trent Knobel decided to come out of retirement to join AFLQ club Labrador Tigers after rejecting offer from AFLQ power house Southport Sharks and Broadbeach Cats

Wigner Dmatrix
The Wigner Dmatrix is a unitary matrix in an irreducible representation of the groups SU2 and SO3 The complex conjugate of the Dmatrix is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian of spherical and symmetric rigid rotors The matrix was introduced in 1927 by Eugene Wigner stands for Darstellung which means representation in German

Let be generators of the Lie algebra of SU2 and SO3 In quantum mechanics these three operators are the components of a vector operator known as angular momentum Examples
are the angular momentum of an electron
in an atom electronic spin and the angular momentum of a rigid rotor 

In all cases the three operators satisfy the following commutation relations
where i is the purely imaginary number and Plancks constant has been set equal to one The Casimir operator 
commutes with all generators of the Lie algebra Hence it may be diagonalized together with  This defines the spherical basis used here

That is in this basis there is a complete set of kets with
where  0 12 1 32 2 for SU2 and  0 1 2  for SO3 In both cases m

A 3dimensional rotation operator can be written as
where    are Euler angles characterized by the keywords zyz convention righthanded frame righthand screw rule active interpretation

The Wigner Dmatrix is a unitary square matrix of dimension 2j  1 in this spherical basis with elements
where
is an element of the orthogonal Wigners small dmatrix

That is in this basis formula7 is diagonal like the  matrix factor but unlike the above  factor

Wigner gave the following expression
The sum over s is over such values that the factorials are nonnegative

Note The dmatrix elements defined here are real In the oftenused zxz convention of Euler angles the factor formula9 in this formula is replaced by formula10 causing half of the functions to be purely imaginary The realness of the dmatrix elements is one of the reasons that the zyz convention used in this article is usually preferred in quantum mechanical applications

The dmatrix elements are related to Jacobi polynomials formula11 with nonnegative formula12 and formula13 Let 

Then with formula16 the relation is

where formula18

The complex conjugate of the Dmatrix satisfies a number of differential properties
that can be formulated concisely by introducing the following operators with formula19
which have quantum mechanical meaning they are spacefixed rigid rotor angular momentum operators

Further
which have quantum mechanical meaning they are bodyfixed rigid rotor angular momentum operators

The operators satisfy the commutation relations
and the corresponding relations with the indices permuted cyclically 
The formula23 satisfy anomalous commutation relations 
have a minus sign on the right hand side
The two sets mutually commute
and the total operators squared are equal

Their explicit form is

The operators formula27 act on the first row index of the Dmatrix
and

The operators formula23 act on the second column index of the Dmatrix
and because of the anomalous commutation relation the raisinglowering operators
are defined with reversed signs

Finally

In other words the rows and columns of the complex conjugate Wigner Dmatrix span 
irreducible representations of the isomorphic Lie algebras generated by formula34 and formula35

An important property of the Wigner Dmatrix follows from the commutation of 
formula36 with the time reversal operator 
formula37
or
Here we used that formula37 is antiunitary hence the complex conjugation after moving
formula41 from ket to bra formula42 and formula43

The Wigner Dmatrix elements formula44 form a set
of orthogonal functions of the Euler angles formula45 formula46 and formula47
This is a special case of the Schur orthogonality relations

Crucially by the PeterWeyl theorem they further form a complete set

The group characters for SU2 only depend on the rotation angle  being class functions so then independent of the axes of rotation
and consequently satisfy simpler orthogonality relations through the Haar measure of the group
The completeness relation worked out in the same reference 395 is 
whence for   0 

The set of Kronecker product matrices
forms a reducible matrix representation of the groups SO3 and SU2 Reduction into irreducible components is by the following equation
The symbol formula55 is a
ClebschGordan coefficient

For integer values of formula56 the Dmatrix elements with second index equal to zero are proportional
to spherical harmonics and associated Legendre polynomials normalized to unity and with Condon and Shortley phase convention
This implies the following relationship for the dmatrix

A rotation of spherical harmonics formula59 then is effectively a composition of two rotations 

When both indices are set to zero the Wigner Dmatrix elements are given by ordinary Legendre polynomials

In the present convention of Euler angles formula45 is 
a longitudinal angle and formula63 is a colatitudinal angle spherical polar angles
in the physical definition of such angles This is one of the reasons that the zyz
convention is used frequently in molecular physics
From the timereversal property of the Wigner Dmatrix follows immediately
There exists a more general relationship to the spinweighted spherical harmonics

for j  32 

for j  2 

Wigner dmatrix elements with swapped lower indices are found with the relation

Burn Baby Burn song
Burn Baby Burn is a song by Ash released as the second single from the Free All Angels album on 2 April 2001 reaching number 13 on the UK Singles Chart and number 20 in Ireland It was released as a single CD released on 2CD formats the second of which being an enhanced CD and as a 7 vinyl and was also released for the first time on DVD format The song can also be found on the Intergalactic Sonic 7s hits collection

Burn Baby Burn was originally written for NuClear Sounds but did not make the cut However Mark Hamilton liked the riff and encouraged Wheeler to rewrite parts of the song namely the chorus

Originally the track was titled This Is Slow Suicide then simply Slow Suicide but was changed at the last minute to Burn Baby Burn to avoid radio censorship

Burn Baby Burn was the first ever song played on the BBCs 6 Music station

For release in America the song was remixed and features a new midsong breakdown during the final bridge which reflects the bands live arrangement Burn Baby Burn has been consistently in the bands set since the songs release As such it appears on the Tokyo Blitz live DVD

Burn Baby Burn was also released as a DVD The DVD featured the single acoustic versions of the 1995 single Girl from Mars the Free All Angels track Someday and Chinese New Year  later released as a bside to Polaris and was the first episode of Ashs road movies Entitled Episode 1 Road Movie it lasted 20 minutes and starred the bands usual rockstar antics ensuring a Parental Guidance sticker for the DVD The DVD was limited edition and only 8000 were produced

The track was released in a promo EP form in many countries In Australia it starred all of the bsides from the 2CDs released for Burn Baby Burn as well as the song itself

The video for Burn Baby Burn is directed by Jeff Thomas It stars the band performing the song while basketball players play around them and cheerleaders dance The video was shot in Selsdon High School and starred carefully selected cheerleaders and the London Towers basketball team Ash claim it to be one of their favourite videos and one of the most enjoyable they have shot The cheerleaders in the video also performed with the band on Top of the Pops

Both of the CD1 bsides were recorded for BBC Radio 1s Evening Sessions 13th Floor is a fastpaced number left over from the Free All Angels sessions that also appears on the Cosmic Debris bsides collection

The second CD1 bside Only In Dreams is a cover of the final song of Weezers selftitled debut album known as The Blue Album It is one of Ashs longest songs at just under 8 minutes

Thinking About You appears on the CD2 version of Burn Baby Burn as well as on Cosmic Debris A soft acoustic song its somewhat of a fan favourite due to its heartstring pulling lyrics telling of a faraway love

Finally the last bside is a remix of Free All Angels track Submission written by drummer Rick McMurray

Unity Day Russia
Unity Day also called Day of Peoples Unity or National Unity Day  Den narodnogo yedinstva is a national holiday in Russia held on November 4 October 22 Old Style It commemorates the popular uprising which expelled Polish occupation forces from Moscow in November 1612 and more generally the end of the Time of Troubles and turning point of the PolishMuscovite War 16051618

The days name alludes to the idea that all classes of Russian society united to preserve Russian statehood when there was neither a tsar nor a patriarch to guide them In 1613 tsar Mikhail Romanov instituted a holiday named Day of Moscows Liberation from Polish Invaders It was celebrated in the Russian Empire until 1917 when it was replaced with a commemoration of the Russian Revolution Unity Day was reinstituted by the Russian Federation in 2005 when the events of the year 1612 have been celebrated instead of those of 1917 every November 4 since The day is also the feast day of the Russian Orthodox icon of Our Lady of Kazan

According to a poll in 2007 only 23 percent of Russians know the name of the holiday up from 8 percent in 2005 22 percent identified the holiday as the Day of Accord and Reconciliation the name of the holiday on November 7 during the 1990s Only 4 percent knew that the holiday commemorates the liberation of Moscow from Polish invaders down from 5 percent in 2005

President Vladimir Putin reestablished the holiday in order to replace the commemoration of the October Revolution known as the Day of Great October Socialist Revolution during Soviet period and as the Day of Accord and Conciliation in postSoviet times which formerly took place on November 7 His decision angered some sections of the public particularly the Communist Party who continued with celebrations on November 7 Putins predecessor Boris Yeltsin took a limited action of changing the name of the holiday by completely removing it Putin initiated a controversy that continues today

The center of the first of the revived tradition was Nizhny Novgorod where monument to Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky and Vladimir Putin laid flowers The Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus Alexy II was also in attendance Activities in Moscow included two processions and a Russian March Religious processions occurred with local heads of administration in attendance Fundraisers were held in Tula a district art festival occurred for children with disabilities and in Kaluga veterans and orphans were given local confectionery products

A Russian Marc took place despite bans in cities such as Moscow A ninetyminute show involving more than a thousand actors was staged in Nizhny Novgorod

1612 Vladimir Khotinenkos historical film dramatizing the event the holiday commemorates was released on November 1 Thirtynine events were held in Moscow alone Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky and presented the Pushkin Medal at a reception in the Moscow Kremlin for the preservation of Russian spiritual heritage and promotion of the Russian language

President Dmitry Medvedev laid flowers at the monument to Minin and Pozharsky and organized a reception in the Grand Kremlin Palace In Revolution Square 7000 attended a meeting devoted to the Day of National Unity Activists of the youth movement Nashi called for a day of under the covers  10000 young people gathered on Vasilevsky Descent Square to sew a patchwork of thousands into the socalled blanket the world There was a free rock festival Call aimed at combating negative phenomena among young people such as drugs

A celebration was held of the consecration of the restored gate icon of St Nicholas Mozhaiskogo on the Nikolskaya Tower of the Moscow Kremlin with the participation of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus Kirill I

Nizhny Novgorod was once again the center of the celebration The organization of the regional government allocated a holiday budget of 15200000 rubles Here a sculpture 30 meters in length and about 5 meters in height was erected with the image of Kozma Minin

Maria was married at the age of 17 or 18 to a local landowner who served as a district judge The marriage was unhappy Marias husband was originally wealthy but lost his money gambling and going on sprees They eventually separated but only after Maria had given birth to her only son

She moved to Saint Petersburg around 1830 Several years later she began writing to support herself and her child and to pay off some of her husbands debts Her first story appeared in 1837 and she published works regularly until her death Her first success came with the twovolume 
story collection Evenings on the Karpovka 18381839 Her twovolume collection Tales 1840 was wellreceived as was her Sketches of Southern France and Nice 1844 Some of Zhukovas stories are historical and some are set abroad with nonRussian characters a common feature of Russian fiction in the Romantic period

Hickleton and Thurnscoe Halt railway station
Hickleton and Thurnscoe Halt was a small railway station on the Hull and Barnsley Railway line between Wrangbrook Junction and WathuponDearne The halt was built to serve the mining villages of Hickleton and Thurnscoe near Barnsley South Yorkshire and was situated in the centre of Thurnscoe at the point where the line crosses over the main Barnsley road Hickleton village was situated over away

The station was situated south of Moorhouse and South Elmsall and consisted of a single wooden platform with a single storey Double Pavilion style wooden station building The platform surface was of gravel and the station opened on 28 August 1902 and closed along with the others on the line on 6 April 1929 

The line was controlled by two standard HB style signal boxes named Hickleton Station and Hickleton Colliery

Immediately south of the station was the entrance to Hickleton Main Colliery where the HB shared sidings with the Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway line

The film is set in the Ming dynasty during the Wanli Emperor Gu Jinfu a eunuch from the spy agency Eastern Depot leads a team to retrieve the Chrysanthemum Manual a martial arts manual which was stolen from the imperial palace They track down and attack Lin Zhennan Lin Zhennan encounters Linghu Chong and Yue Lingshan two students from the Mount Hua Sect and asks them to inform his son Lin Pingzhi where the manual is hidden

While making their way to rendezvous with their Mount Hua Sect fellows Linghu Chong and Yue Lingshan chance upon Liu Zhengfeng who is planning to retire from the jianghu martial artists community with his friend Qu Yang Just then Zuo Lengshan who works for Eastern Depot shows up with his men and tries to arrest Linghu Chong and Qu Yang Linghu Chong and the others manage to escape but Liu and Qu are seriously wounded in the process Before committing suicide Liu and Qu perform Xiaoao Jianghu a musical piece they composed together and pass their instruments and the score to Linghu Chong

Linghu Chong encounters the reclusive swordsman Feng Qingyang and learns the skill Nine Swords of Dugu from him He also finds out that his gentlemanly teacher Yue Buqun who leads the Mount Hua Sect is actually a powerhungry hypocrite In the meantime Gu Jinfus henchman Ouyang Quan impersonates Lin Pingzhi who is dead and infiltrates the Mount Hua Sect He tricks Linghu Chong into revealing the whereabouts of the Sunflower Manual and then poisons him Linghu Chong is saved by Ren Yingying and Lan Fenghuang from the Sun Moon Holy Cult They combine forces to defeat and kill Zuo Lengshan and his men

Around the same time Yue Buqun Ouyang Quan Gu Jinfu and the others have arrived at the location where the Sunflower Manual is hidden and are fighting over the manual Linghu Chong shows up kills Gu Jinfu exposes Yue Buquns treachery and defeats him He decides to spend the rest of his life roaming the jianghu with his friends

Technical textile
A technical textile is a textile product manufactured for nonaesthetic purposes where function is the primary criterion Technical textiles include textiles for automotive applications medical textiles eg implants geotextiles reinforcement of embankments agrotextiles textiles for crop protection and protective clothing eg heat and radiation protection for fire fighter clothing molten metal protection for welders stab protection and bulletproof vests and spacesuits

The sector is large growing and supports a vast array of other industries The global growth rate of technical textiles is about 4 per year which is greater than the growth rate of home and apparel textiles which are growing at a rate of 1 per year Currently technical textile materials are most widely used in filter clothing furniture hygiene medicals and construction material

Technical textiles can be divided into many categories depending on their end use The classification system developed by Techtextil Messe Frankfurt Exhibition GmbH is widely used in Europe North America and Asia Techtextil specifies 12 application areas Agrotech Buildtech Clothtech Geotech Hometech Indutech Medtech Mobiltech Oekotech Packtech Protech and Sporttech Architech Architectural textile Military textilesAutotech Automobile textiles Smartech Smart Textiles Wearable computers  These are sometimes spelled Agrotex Buildtex Clothtex Geotex Hometex Indutex Medtex Mobiltex Oekotex Ecotex Packtex Protex and Sportex

Textiles used in Agriculture are termed as agro textiles They are used for crop protection fertilisation  The essential properties required are strength elongation stiffness and biodegradation resistance to sunlight and resistance to toxic environment All these properties help with the growth and harvesting of crops and other foodstuffs There is a growing interest in using materials which gradually degrade

Some of the examples of Agro textiles are

Construction textiles are used in construction concrete reinforcement faade foundation systems interior construction insulations proofing materials air conditioning noise prevention visual protection protection against the sun building safety

An interesting and aesthetic appealing application is the use of textile membranes for roof construction This area is also referred to as textile architecture PVC coated high tenacity PES teflon coated glass fibre fabrics or silicone coated PES are used for their low creep properties Splendid examples of such construction are found in football stadia airports and hotels

Technical textiles for clothing applications Especially in the finishing process where fabric is treated under pressure and high temperature the technical textile supports the fabric for smooth processing This is usually the blend of polyester modal viscose nylon etc

These are used in reinforcement of embankments or in construction work The fabrics in geo textiles are permeable fabrics and are used with soils having ability to separate filter protect or drain The application areas include civil engineering earth and road construction dam engineering soil sealing and in drainage systems The fabric used in it must have good strength durability low moisture absorption and thickness Mostly nonwoven and woven fabrics are used in it Synthetic fibers like glass polypropylene and acrylic fibers are used to prevent cracking of the concrete plastic and other building materials Polypropylene and polyester are used in geo textiles and dryliquid filtration due to their compatibility

Textiles used in a domestic environment  interior decoration and furniture carpeting protection against the sun cushion materials fireproofing pillows floor and wall coverings textile reinforced structuresfittings

In the contract market such as for large area buildings ships caravans busses  fire retardant materials are used Fire retardant properties are obtained either through the use of inherent fire retardant fibres such as modacryl or through the application of a coating with fire retardant additives bromide of phosphorus compounds

Textiles used for chemical and electrical applications and textiles related to mechanical engineering Silkscreen printing filtration plasma screens propulsion technology liftingconveying equipment soundproofing elements melting processes roller covers grinding technology insulations seals fuel cell

Technical textiles for Lifting applications Used in process of lifting heavy goods The textile produced is strongly woven with High tenacity yarns and the fabric is treated with heat and high temperature controlling its elongations This is usually made of High tenacity polyester and Nylon however HMPE yarns as Dyneema are also used

These textiles are used in the construction of automobiles railways ships aircraft and spacecraft Examples are Truck covers PVC coated PES fabrics car trunk coverings often needle felts lashing belts for cargo tie downs seat covers knitted materials seat belts nonwovens for cabin air filtration also covered in indutech airbags parachutes boats inflatable air balloons

These textiles are used in automobiles ships and aircraft Many coated and reinforced textiles are used in materials for engines such as air ducts timing belts air filters nonwovens for engine sound isolation A number of materials are also used in the interior of cars The most obvious are seat covers safety belts and airbags but one can find textiles also for the sealing Nylon gives strength and its bursting strength being high is used as air bags in cars

Carbon composites are mostly used in the manufacture of aeroplane parts while carbon fibre is used for making higher end tyres High tensile polyester is used for making air balloons

New applications for textiles in environmental protection applications  floor sealing erosion protection air cleaning prevention of water pollution water cleaning waste treatmentrecycling depositing area construction product extraction domestic water sewerage plants

Packaging silos containers bags lashing straps canvas covers marquee tents

The main target of the technical protective fabrics is to improve people safety in their workplaces A technical protective fabric can save a workers life thats why most of them are mainly used to manufacture PPE personal protective equipment 
The demand of these fabrics is growing around the world thank to the sensibilitization of the society requiring more safety at work There are some organizations around the world ASTM and ISO which describe the requirements and regulations to fulfill by a fabric to be considered as a technical protective fabric
The aim of a technical protective fabric isnt fashion they are designed to have extra values in protection against some hazards

Nowadays it can be found in the market technical fabrics which protect of 

These fabrics are made of different kind of fibers because every blend apports different technical characteristics to the fabric


Shoes sports equipment flying and sailing sports climbing angling cycling winter and summer sports indoor sport it can vary from anything including sports bags

For industrial applications and in power transmission technical textiles are used in conveyor belts Carcass is a fabric inside the conveyor belt which is responsible for the strength and stretch properties of the belt This carcass is made with layers of woven fabrics bonded together

It has been heard that soon textiles will be merged with electronics in all areas In future wearable computers would be launched these will not be like advance wrist watches etc they will contain IC s in fabric to develop fabric keyboards and other wearable computer devices These types of products are known as Interactive electronic textiles IET Research to support IET development is being conducted in many universities Growing consumer interest in mobile electronic devices will initiate the demand for IET products

Ulmus Exoniensis
Ulmus Exoniensis the Exeter Elm was discovered near Exeter England in 1826 and propagated by the Ford  Please nursery in that city Traditionally believed to be a cultivar of the Wych Elm U glabra its fastigiate shape when young upwardcurving tracery small samarae and leaves late leafflush and late leaffall taken with its southwest England provenance suggest a link with the Cornish Elm which shares these characteristics

The tree initially has an upright columnar form but later develops a large rounded crown and occasionally reaches 17m in height Older specimens may develop pendulous branches Exeter Elm is chiefly distinguished by its contorted leaves  11cm long by 8cm broad rounder than the type wych and with more laciniate margins which occasionally wrap around the branchlets and remain thus well into winter Exoniensis is often pollarded to produce a denser fanshaped crown see main picture 
Chevalier noted 1942 that Ulmus montana fastigiata Exeter Elm was one of four European cultivars found by researchers in The Netherlands to have significant resistance to the earlier strain of Dutch elm disease prevalent in the 1920s and 30s the others being Monumentalis  Berardii and Vegeta The four were rated less resistant than U foliacea clone 23 from Spain later cultivated as Christine Buisman Exoniensis possesses a moderate resistance to the more virulent strain of Dutch elm disease and consequently often featured in the Dutch elm breeding programme in association with the Field Elm U minor and Himalayan Elm U wallichiana

Once commonly planted in the UK and parts of western Europe Exoniensis is also known to have been marketed in Poland in the 19th century by the Ulrich nursery Warsaw and remains in commerce there The Spth nursery of Berlin cultivated the tree as U montana fastigiata U exoniensis  from the early 20th century It is possible that three trees supplied by the Spth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 as U montana fastigiata were Exeter Elm old specimens of which survive in Edinburgh it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city In Sweden Exoniensis is sometimes pruned from an early age to form a tidy coneshaped tree called locally pyramidalm  pyramid elm  also one of Spths names for Exoniensis It is found in Australia at the Ballarat Botanical Gardens where it is listed on the Significant Tree Register of the National Trust An Ulmus plumosa a synonym of Exoniensis in continental Europe of elegant and pyramidal shape and dark green foliage appeared in the 1902 catalogue of the Bobbink and Atkins nursery Rutherford New Jersey
Bean 1936 noted a large old specimen 12 feet in girth in the garden of the Old Vicarage Bitton Gloucestershire A 180yearold specimen in Hamburg has attained a height of 28m and a trunk diameter of 145m The UK TROBI Champion tree is in Scotland at Baxter Gardens Dundee measuring 15m high by 103cm dbh in 2004 The cultivar is represented in ire by a tree at Birr Castle Mount Palmer County Offaly with a dbh of 29cm when measured in 2002

Clusius Columella Dodoens Lobel Plantyn Nanguen   Wanoux   The cultivar Columella features the same rough rounded contorted leaves the result of a recessive gene inherited from the Exeter Elm 

Exoniensis also indirectly featured in the Italian elm breeding programme as an ancestor of Plantyn which was crossed with clones of the Siberian Elm Ulmus pumila to produce the cultivars Arno Plinio and San Zanobi

Semiprime ring
In ring theory a branch of mathematics semiprime ideals and semiprime rings are generalizations of prime ideals and prime rings In commutative algebra semiprime ideals are also called radical ideals

For example in the ring of integers the semiprime ideals are the zero ideal along with those ideals of the form formula1 where n is a squarefree integer So formula2 is a semiprime ideal of the integers because 30  2  3  5 with no repeated prime factors but formula3 is not because 12  2  3 with a repeated prime factor

The class of semiprime rings includes semiprimitive rings prime rings and reduced rings

Most definitions and assertions in this article appear in and 

For a commutative ring R a proper ideal A is a semiprime ideal if A satisfies either of the following equivalent conditions

The latter condition that the complement is closed under powers is analogous to the fact that complements of prime ideals are closed under multiplication

As with prime ideals this is extended to noncommutative rings idealwise The following conditions are equivalent definitions for a semiprime ideal A in a ring R

Here again there is a noncommutative analogue of prime ideals as complements of msystems A nonempty subset S of a ring R is called an nsystem if for any s in S there exists an r in R such that srs is in S With this notion an additional equivalent point may be added to the above list


The ring R is called a semiprime ring if the zero ideal is a semiprime ideal In the commutative case this is equivalent to R being a reduced ring since R has no nonzero nilpotent elements In the noncommutative case the ring merely has no nonzero nilpotent right ideals So while a reduced ring is always semiprime the converse is not true

To begin with it is clear that prime ideals are semiprime and that for commutative rings a semiprime primary ideal is prime

While the intersection of prime ideals is not usually prime it is a semiprime ideal Shortly it will be shown that the converse is also true that every semiprime ideal is the intersection of a family of prime ideals

For any ideal B in a ring R we can form the following sets

The set formula5 is the definition of the radical of B and is clearly a semiprime ideal containing B and in fact is the smallest semiprime ideal containing B The inclusion above is sometimes proper in the general case but for commutative rings it becomes an equality

With this definition an ideal A is semiprime if and only if formula6 At this point it is also apparent that every semiprime ideal is in fact the intersection of a family of prime ideals Moreover this shows that the intersection of any two semiprime ideals is again semiprime

By definition R is semiprime if and only if formula7 that is the intersection of all prime ideals is zero This ideal formula8 is also denoted by formula9 and also called Baers lower nilradical or the BaerMccoy radical or the prime radical of R

A right Goldie ring is a ring that has finite uniform dimension also called finite rank as a right module over itself and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of its subsets Goldies theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients The ArtinWedderburn theorem then completely determines the structure of this ring of quotients

Rauter first met Adolf Hitler in 1929 and joined the National Socialist cause in Austria His forays in Austria forced him to flee to Germany in 1933 where he became part of the NSDAP department for Austria He joined the SA and was active in planning illegal NSDAP activities in Austria In 1935 he left the SA to become a member of the SS Until 1940 he was the Leader of the SS Southeast department in Breslau

In May 1940 he was appointed Generalkommissar fr das Sicherheitswesen General Commissioner for Security and Hherer SSund Polizeifhrer Higher SS and Police leader for the occupied Netherlands In his position as police commander and highest ranking SS leader in the Netherlands Rauter was responsible for the deportation of 110000 Dutch Jews to the Nazi concentration camps 6000 survived and the repression of the Dutch resistance He had 300000 Dutchmen deported to Germany for forced labour His first victims to die were those killed during the armed break up of the February strike on 26 February 1941 accounting for 9 dead that day he also immediately declared a state of emergency and ordered summary executions

He was the chief promoter of terror through summary arrests and internment in the Netherlands The SS set up a concentration camp named Herzogenbusch after the city of sHertogenbosch but located in the neighboring town of Vught that gave the camp its name Kamp Vught In total this camp detained 31000 people of whom some 735 were killed Also his SS manned a socalled polizeiliches Durchgangslager or police transit camp near Amersfoort known as Kamp Amersfoort in fact also a concentration camp where some 35000 people were detained and maltreated and 650 people Dutch and Russian died Rauters SS also managed the Kamp Westerbork polizeiliches Durchgangslager Westerbork the place from which some 110000 Dutch Jews were deported to Nazi concentration and extermination camps mainly Auschwitz and Sobibor

Under Rauters guidance a special block was built for political prisoners ie resistance workers in the Scheveningen prison These were often held in indefinite detention In total 28000 people were detained here over 4 years many were severely mistreated some were tried and 738 men and 21 women died here or on the nearby execution field the Waalsdorpervlakte now a national place of remembrance

Rauter also instigated a system of retaliation for assaults on Nazi officials and their Dutch collaborators one killed Nazi equalled ten Dutch victims one killed Dutch collaborator equalled three Dutch victims During 1944 these numbers sharply increased with the rise of resistance violence

During the Allied assault on Arnhem in Operation Market Garden Rauter took the active field command of the Kampfgruppe Rauter during operations in the Veluwe area and near the bridges over the IJssel river Kampfgruppe Rauter consisted of the Landstorm Nederland Wachbataillon Nordwest and a regiment of the Ordnungspolizei After the assault on Arnhem had been fought off by the Germans Rauter was given the command of the Maas front as a General in the WaffenSS

Influencer marketing
Influencer marketing also influence marketing or social media influencer is a form of marketing in which focus is placed on influential people rather than the target market as a whole on social media It identifies the individuals who have influence over potential customers and orients marketing activities around these influencers

Influencer content may be framed as testimonial advertising where they play the role of a potential buyer themselves or they may be third parties These third parties exist either in the supply chain retailers manufacturers etc or may be socalled valueadded influencers such as journalists academics industry analysts and professional advisers

In the United States influence marketing is treated by the Federal Trade Commission as a form of paid endorsement governed under the rules for native advertising the agency applies established truthinadvertising standards to such advertising and establishes requirements for disclosure on the part of endorsers influencers

Other countries mediaregulatory bodies such as Australias have created guidelines around influencer marketing following the decision of the FTC In the United Kingdom a voluntary agreement was announced in January 2019 between the countrys Competition and Markets Authority and highprofile social media influencers to ensure that they comply with consumer law Most countries have not created a regulatory framework for influencer marketing

Most discussion on the generic topic of social influence centres on compliance and persuasion in a social environment In the context of influencer marketing influence is less about argument and coercion to a particular point of view and more about loose interactions between various parties in a community Influence is often equated to advocacy but may also be negative and is thus related to concepts of promoters and detractors

The idea of a twostep flow of communication was introduced in The Peoples Choice Paul Lazarsfeld Bernard Berelson and Hazel Gaudet a 1940 study on the decision making process of voters This idea was further developed in Personal Influence Lazarsfeld Elihu Katz 1955 and The Effects of Mass Communication Joseph Klapper 1960

Influencer marketing tends to be broken into two subpractices earned influencer marketing and paid influencer marketing Earned marketing stems from unpaid or preexisting relationships with influencers or third party content that is promoted by the influencer to further their own personal social growth Paid influencer marketing campaigns can take the form of sponsorship preroll advertising or testimonial messaging and can appear at any point in the content Influencer compensation can be based on a flat rate fee per piece of content earned as affiliate income resulting from sales or clickthroughs generated by the influencers content or might be a combination of the two where influencers are paid a fee as well as earning affiliate income from their content Budgets vary widely and are usually based on audience reach Most influencers are paid upfront before a marketing campaign while others are paid after the execution of the marketing campaign 

Some influencers accept gifted products or services as compensation in exchange for posting However these gifts are subject to IRS rules  regulations and in many cases their value is considered taxable income

As a companys brands evolve in terms of marketing the cost in relation to the possible benefits ie purchase it can receive is very important The airing of a television spot has a high cost conversely working with an influencer has a negligible cost If influencers have 200000 followers on their social media site and a company gives them a product specifically as a marketing tool which they are to expose to their audience the companys financial outlay by comparison would be negligible The company will have spent less the cost of the product but exposed their product to a more focused group of followers and therefore potential purchasers of the public figure

As more people use the internet more are making purchases online This forces some companies to invest more resources in their general advertising  on the internet and on social networks in particular Marketing through social networks allows for an instantaneous purchase process a person can see the item and typically be connected to an online retailer immediately This decrease between lag time  from seeing the promoted item and being redirected to the product  is more effective for spontaneous purchases

Many influencers social media presence is on both Instagram and Twitter The rise in popularity of video content means a growing number of influencers can also be found on YouTube

Web services can be used to trawl social media sites for users who exert influence in their respective communities The social influencer marketing firm then asks those influencers to try products or services and discuss them on their respective social networks Clients can then observe an enhanced digital dashboard with metrics that measure the dissemination of brand mentions across numerous web platforms

At least 70 companies offer online influence measurement Advocates of this onlineonly approach claim that online activity reflects or preempts the trends in offline transactions For example Razorfish released one of the first social influencer marketing reports titled Fluent The report discusses many theories surrounding social marketing including the importance of the pushpull dynamic and online consumer empowerment authenticity and importance of buzz marketing

Online activity can be a core part of offline decisionmaking as consumers research products and review sites

Critics of this onlineonly approach argue that only researching online sources misses critical influential individuals and inputs They note that much influential exchange of information occurs in the offline world and is not captured in online media Indeed the majority of consumer exchanges occur facetoface not in an online environment as evidenced by Carl He notes that an overwhelming majority of wordofmouth WOM episodes nearly 80  occur in facetoface interpersonal settings while online WOM accounted for only seven to ten percent of the reported WOM episodes

Carl concludes that The majority of the WOM action still seems to be happening in the offline world These findings are especially provocative since they emerge at a time when more and more organizations are paying attention to how their brands are discussed online and recent academic research has focused on online WOM Thus it is important for organizations to keep both online and offline conversations on their radar screen

Keller Fay announced in 2007 that While experts have previously estimated that 80 of marketingrelevant word of mouth takes place offline ie facetoface or via telephone the new results indicate that this figure is even higher  92

More recently Nate Elliott at Forrester observed that the huge majority of users influence each other face to face rather than through social online channels like blogs and social networks

With any marketing strategy risks are involved and there have been reports of brands dropping their influencers because of the controversies that surround them One such influencer is YouTuber PewDiePie whose use of antisemitic and racist comments lead to canceled deals from Disney and widespread backlash

Some marketers use influencer marketing to establish credibility in the market others to create social conversations around their brand and others to drive online or instore sales of their products The influencer marketer can also take to marketing diversified products and services leveraging leveraging upon the credibility earned over time The value which influencer marketing creates can be measured in several ways Some marketers measure earned media value others track impressions and others track cost per action

Influencer marketing derives its value from three sources

Influencer marketing in a commercial context comprises four main activities


Influencer marketing is continuously improved by constant evaluation done simultaneously with the four main activities

Influencer marketing is not synonymous with word of mouth marketing WOM but influence may be communicated this way WOM is a central to the mechanics of influencer marketing

There is no consensus on what an influencer is One writer defines them as a range of third parties who exercise influence over the organization and its potential customers Another defines an influencer as a third party who significantly shapes the customers purchasing decision but may never be accountable for it Another says influencers are activists are wellconnected have impact have active minds and are trendsetters though this set of attributes is aligned specifically to consumer markets

Exactly what is included in influencer marketing depends on the context retail or B2B and the medium of influence transmission online or offline or both as companys are increasingly eager to identify and work with influencers

Business is working harder and paying more to pursue people who are trying to watch and listen less to its messages Targeting influencers is seen as a method of increasing the reach of marketing messages in order to counteract the growing tendency of prospective customers to ignore marketing

The first step in influencer marketing is to identify influencers They are specific to discrete market segments and are used as conduits to the entire target segment While there are lists of generic influencers such as the Time 100 they have limited use in marketing programmes targeted at specific segments

Market research techniques can be used to identify influencers using predefined criteria to determine the extent and type of influence


In a study of what traits are associated with the top influencers one researcher found four archetypes of influencers

Malcolm Gladwell notes that the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the involvement of people with a particular and rare set of social gifts and identified three types of influencer who are responsible for the generation communication and adoption of messages


Connectors network across a variety of people and thus have a wide reach They are essential for word of mouth communication

Mavens look to consume information and share it with others and are extremely insightful with regards to trends
Salesmen are charismatic persuaders Their source of influence leans toward the tendency of others to attempt to imitate their behaviour

Currently most material on influencers focuses on consumer markets rather than businesstobusiness influencers A key distinction is that most of the focus in consumer markets is on consumer influencers themselves primarily because word of mouth communication is prevalent in consumer environments In business marketing influencers are people who affect a sale but are typically removed from the actual purchase decision Consultants analysts journalists academics regulators and standards bodies are examples of business influencers

Not all business influencers are equal Some have more influence than others and some mechanism of ranking is required to distinguish between key influencers and less impactful people One model for ranking business influencers looks at various criteria


Various companies worldwide have developed their own proprietary methodologies for identifying and targeting influencers for a market or market sector

Influencers can also be defined by their number of followers Topinfluencers influencers with large followings become celebrities and generate a strong reach However microinfluencers are more available to their audiences create more focused retainable and attainable content and in the long run generate higher engagement rates

Under United States law those who endorse products or service andor provide testimonials for products or services are obligated to disclose brand information to their target audience and follow other relevant guidelines However that doesnt stop some content providers and the like from being deceptive about their opinion to ensure they make money This often makes them subject to backlash from consumers who spend money on products that fail to uphold their intended purpose

In 2014 YouTube beauty guru Nicole Guerriero was criticized in a series of hateful comments on her Instagram page Fans were outraged after purchasing Bellami hair extensions and believing that the company that sponsored Guerriero was misleading consumers into thinking their hair extensions were of the same quality of those sent in PR packages to promote on YouTube and Instagram by influencers This prompted Guerriero to upload a video on YouTube addressing peoples concerns with the product

A large influencer sponsor in 2018 across all social media platforms has been the brand Zaful a clothing company based in China The company promises cheap discounted clothing along with free shipping Many complaints have been made by consumers on YouTube Instagram Facebook and Twitter Consumers claim that the company uses images of clothing from other brands deceiving people into purchasing items that are not as shown Poor quality and shipping issues are often cited The company also falls under the category of fast fashion where sweatshops are used to create clothing to ensure it can be sold to consumers for a low price
In November 2018 YouTube makeup artist James Charles announced he would be releasing an eyeshadow palette in collaboration with Morphe Weeks before the release he uploaded a video swatching the colours A YouTuber named Kuckian then released a video calling the swatches a scam and calling out Charles for editing the video in a such a way that misleads consumers not giving them a fair idea of what the pigment truly looks like on skin Reactions to the video were mixed with some people coming to Charles defense calling Kuckian a liar and others sending hateful tweets to Charles directly

In an interview with Ashley Graham Kim Kardashian admitted to being offered one million dollars to post an image of herself on Instagram wearing clothing from a brand she did not name Kardashian explained that she had turned down the deal because this brand tends to steal ideas from her husbands clothing line Yeezy She also claimed the company was notorious for making money from her and her sisters red carpet and everyday looks

Brand deals are likely to break and sponsors are just as likely to pull out of backings if an influencer is under scrutiny Making money is the primary goal and if a brand risks being tarnished at the hands of controversy businesses are quick to pull the plug Highprofile actors influencers YouTubers and others in the field of entertainment have lost brand deals based on inappropriate comments poor judgement and a lack of knowledge

In 2017 highest ranked YouTuber in the world PewDiePie was also under fire for using a racial slur during a videogame live stream Since then YouTube has dropped AdSense from his videos a source of income and they cancelled the second season of his YouTube Red show Disney a sponsor also parted ways with the YouTuber

Fake influencers have been around as long as their real counterparts have All measurements used to determine the veracity of an influencer account can be fabricated Instagram has shut down thirdparty sites and apps which provide paid services to individual accounts for buying followers likes comments and more Despite these shutdowns selfhosted automation apps such as FollowLiker have continued to operate

A marketing agency conducted an experiment to test whether fake influencer accounts can profit The company created two fictitious accounts  with their presence built up with bought followers and engagement likes and comments  and applied to campaigns on popular influencer marketing websites They published their experiment with a stepbystep explanation of how the accounts were created and the brands which sponsored them

Influencer marketing works so well because of social media When it comes to ads many people ignore or fast forward them on TV and a majority completely bypass them online with tools like AdBlock

An analysis of more than 7000 UK influencers showed that about half the followers of influencers with up to 20000 followers are lowquality due to the inclusion of mass followers internet bots and other suspicious accounts More than 4 of 10 engagements with this group of influencers are nonauthentic

A study of UK influencers which looked at almost 700000 posts from the first half of 2018 found that 12 of UK influencers had bought fake followers

Sources of influencers can be varied Marketers traditionally target influencers that are easy to identify such as press industry analysts and highprofile executives For most B2C purchases however influencers might include people known to the purchaser and the retailer staff In highervalue businesstobusiness B2B transactions the community of influencers may be wide and varied and include consultants governmentbacked regulators financiers and user communities

Forrester analyst Michael Speyer notes that for small and mediumsize businesses IT sales are influenced by many parties including peers consultants bloggers and technology resellers He advises that Vendors need to identify and characterize the influencers in their market This requires a comprehensive influencer identification program and the establishment of criteria for ranking influencer impact on the decision process

As well as a variety of influencer sources influencers can play a variety of roles at different times in a decision process This idea has been developed in influencer marketing by Brown and Hayes They map out how and when particular types of influencer affect the decision process This then enables marketers to selectively target influencers depending on their individual profile of influence

In order to achieve the purpose of the business clients influencers should deliver a change in attitude towards the clients brand or product The change of the attitude from the viewer takes places from the contents that influencer produces The change itself is believed as a psychological process in human mind The psychological process can be explained under the RACE model reach act convert and engage These four steps are designed to help brands engage with their customers throughout the customer lifecycle

The Australian Vietnam Veterans Welcome Home Parade was held in Sydney on 3 October 1987 and was followed by a concert in The Domain where Redgums Schumann performed his song with veteran Frank Hunt on stage From this parade a desire for a War Memorial to commemorate Vietnam Veterans grew into fruition with the Memorials dedication in October 1992 Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial was constructed in Anzac Parade Canberra in 1992 and includes a Wall of Words Stele B the northern or righthand stele is adorned with a series of 33 quotations fixed in stainless steel lettering Amongst the quotations is

Rusal
United Company RUSAL  is the worlds second largest aluminium company by primary production output as of 2016 It was the largest until overtaken by China Hongqiao Group in 2015 UC RUSAL accounts for almost 9 of the worlds primary aluminium output and 9 of the worlds alumina production

The United Company was formed by the merger of RUSAL Russkiy alyuminiy  SUAL and the alumina assets of Glencore completed in March 2007 According to its own statistics UC Rusal accounts for 62 of the worlds primary aluminium output and 65 of the worlds alumina production while operating assets in 13 countries over five continents employing over 61000 people across its international operations and offices

The company is incorporated in Jersey where it has its financial centre but its headquarters are in Moscow Russian Federation UC Rusal is a public limited company and its shares are traded on the Moscow Stock Exchange Hong Kong Stock Exchange and European Stock Exchange

By November 2018 Rusals net income reached 154 billions

RUSAL has played a decisive role in the consolidation of the Russian aluminium industry during its establishment as a large vertically integrated aluminium holding

UC Rusals roots lie in the business activities of Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska who entered the metals industry as a commodities agent and broker at the Moscow Trade Stock Exchange Moskovskaya Tovarnaya Birzha MTB and then at the Russian Commodities and Raw Materials Exchange Rossiyskaya TovarnoSyryevaya Birzha RTSB As a broker Deripaska dealt in a wide range of commodities including aluminium His work also included trading with major Russian aluminium smelters

Between 1991 and 1994 companies set up by Mr Deripaska with the backing of industrialist and entrepreneur Michael Cherney started investing in the shares of Sayanogorsk Aluminum Smelter SAZ one of the newest and most modern aluminium plants built in Soviet times 19801985 In 1994 Mr Deripaska was elected the General Director of SAZ

In 1997 the companies controlled by Deripaska underwent a general restructuring leading to the creation of Sibirsky Aluminium to manage aluminium and alumina assets acquired by Deripaskas companies By 2000 Sibirsky Aluminium managed among other aluminiumrelated assets majority interests in the Sayanogorsk aluminium smelter the Sayanal foil mill a fabricating plant in Samara Russia and a minority interest in the Nikolaev alumina refinery in Ukraine

Gradual strategic acquisitions and growth projects eventually led to the creation of one of the worlds largest aluminium and alumina producers Rusal has historically opted to fully integrate its assets under centralized operational and management control The company has achieved increased production and efficiency in most of its acquired facilities through production creep improvements achieved through targeted improvements to key processes as well as by undertaking key modernization and expansion projects

Rusal was founded in 2000 after Sibirsky Aluminium and Millhouse Capital owned by Roman Abramovich agreed to merge their aluminium and alumina assets

By 2002 Sibirsky Aluminium and Millhouse Capital were managing controlling stakes in the Armenal foil mill in Armenia and the Belaya Kalitva metallurgical plant and in Russia and also took under management the Friguia bauxite and alumina complex and Bauxite of Kindia Company in Guinea to secure bauxite and alumina supply for its Russian smelters In 2002 Rusal also set up the Engineering and Technology Center in Krasnoyarsk which is now the foundation of the companys internal RD projects

In 2003 Millhouse Capital sold its 50 stake in Rusal to Basic Element which held the remaining half of the shares and belongs to Deripaska In the Ukraine RUSAL increased its share in the Nikolaev alumina refinery to 98

In 2004 Rusal made the strategic decision to focus on its upstream business and began disposing of its downstream assets including the sale of its fabricating division to Alcoa in January 2005 The divestiture process was largely completed in 2006 with the distribution of certain aluminium construction plants and other noncore assets to companies controlled by RUSALs beneficial owner In 2004 Rusal obtained a licence to develop bauxite mines in Guyana and the Bauxite Company of Guyana was subsequently founded

From 2004 to 2006 RUSAL acquired several strategically important assets around the globe In 2004 RUSAL acquired a 90 interest in the Boxitogorsk alumina refinery in Russia and increased its holding in the Nikolaev alumina refinery to 100

In 2005 RUSAL bought a 50 stake in the Komi alumina project from SUAL and became its partner in the project which involved the construction of an integrated bauxite and alumina complex in Russias Komi Republic

Also in 2005 RUSAL completed the acquisition of a 20 equity interest in one of the worlds largest alumina refineries in terms of production capacity Queensland Alumina Limited located in Queensland Australia

Furthermore RUSAL purchased assets of a cathode plant in Lingshi County of Shanxi Province China In April 2008 the company acquired assets of another cathode plant in Taigu County of Shanxi Province China which have been integrated into the existing cathode plant in Lingshi

In 2006 RUSAL acquired assets of the stateowned Aroaima Mining Company in Guyana acquired the remaining equity interest in the Friguia bauxite and alumina complex in Guinea completed an extensive retrofit of the Armenal foil mill and commissioned the Khakas aluminium smelter in Russia one of the most advanced aluminium production facilities in the world RUSAL also acquired a 5616 equity interest in the Sardinian alumina refinery Eurallumina

In order to stay competitive the VAMI and SibVAMI aluminium and magnesium research institutes became the backbone for engineering and technology centres involved in the development of new unique production technologies including RA300 and RA400 reduction cells for RUSAL The new technologies allowed for largescale greenfield and brownfield projects In 2005 RUSAL created its own engineering and construction subsidiary RusalEngineering Development Limited responsible for modernization and construction projects

In December 2006 RUSAL acquired through a privatisation process a 775 equity interest in the Aluminium Smelter Company of Nigeria ALSCON The Group acquired a further 75 equity interest in ALSCON from MAN Ferrostaal AG in January 2008

In late March 2007 the merger between RUSAL its domestic competitor SUAL as well as the bauxite and alumina assets of Swiss commodities trading group Glencore created UC RUSAL The merger created the worlds largest aluminium company at the time with assets in 17 countries across five continents including 16 aluminium smelters 12 alumina refineries eight bauxite mines three powder metallurgy plants three silicon smelters three secondary aluminium plants three aluminium foil mills two cryolite plants and one cathode plant The merger was completed in March 2007 at which time the newly formed company was estimated to have proforma sales of 12 billion and production capacity of about four million tonnes of aluminium and 11 million tonnes of alumina The move completed the 15year process of consolidating the Russian aluminium industry

In April 2008 the Group completed the acquisition of a 25 plus one share equity interest of Norilsk Nickel from Onexim the worlds largest nickel and palladium producer The acquisition allowed the Group to diversify its asset base The consideration for the shares in Norilsk Nickel was partially paid in cash and partially in shares The transaction paved the way to develop RUSAL into a global diversified metals mining and energy group

Because of a string of mergers and acquisitions particularly that of Norilsk Nickel UC Rusal had a high level of debt that was exacerbated by the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 In order to be able to retain its stake in Norilsk Nickel a strategically important company and to avoid having to float the stake to foreign lenders UC Rusal received a 45 billion loan from Russian state bank VEB to repay debts to foreign creditors As part of its debt consolidation efforts in 2009 UC Rusal reduced the costs of its operations by 25 In December of that same year a final agreement between the company and 72 Russian and international lenders to refinance 17 billion of debt were reached

With Chinese aluminium demand growing due to rapid urbanization and industrialization UC Rusal signed a joint venture agreement with China North Industries Corporation NORINCO in April 2012 Rusal also signed a memorandum of understanding with one of its main competitors Shandong Xinfa Group pertaining to the study of future potential cooperation areas such as joint ventures

March 2014 saw UC Rusal enter into a 5050 share joint venture with Israeli automotive component manufacturer Omen High Pressure Die Casting to produce automotive components

Resulting from massive overcapacity in the aluminium market due to China increasing its output of primary aluminium global aluminium prices fell in the years 2007 to 2013 leading Rusal to report a loss of US32bn in 2014 The company asked creditors to agree to delay payments on part of its US10bn net debt pile In August that year national and international lenders agreed to allow the restructuring of its debt

In November 2014 Vladislav Soloviev was appointed as Rusals CEO while Deripaska assumed the role of company president

In 2016 UC Rusal signed another joint venture agreement with a Chinese firm Hebei Joy Sense Cable Co HJSC to produce aluminium cable for electrical applications

In April 2018 the United States imposed sanctions against Oleg Deripaska and his business enterprises including Rusal along with 23 other Russian nationals and entities in their control according to Reuters to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 US election and other malign activity The United States Department of the Treasury issued a statement declaring that Deripaska has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals illegally wiretapping a government official and taking part in extortion and racketeering Further stated were allegations that Deripaska had ordered the murder of a businessman and had links to a Russian organized crime group On April 23 however the US government gave Rusal America Corporation a subsidiary customers more time to comply with sanctions even saying it would consider lifting them if United Company Rusal Plcs major shareholder Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska ceded control of the company Department of the Treasury gave these clients until October 23 2018 to comply with wind down business the Rusal sanctions

In May 2018 the company announced the resignation of its CEO Alexandra Bouriko and seven board members in order to avoid US sanctions against Oleg Deripaska

In January 2018 the US lifted sanctions after Deripaska reduced his stake in the company to less that 50 snd his voting rights to less than 35 US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell among others argued that this would maintain pressure on Deripaska without disrupting aluminum markets In April 2019 the company announced a project in Ashland Kentucky that would produce flatrolled aluminum products for the US automotive industry McConnell represents Kentucky

According to media reports UC Rusal seeks to cover all the energy required to power its aluminium smelters via clean energy by 2020 particularly using hydropower The companys current energy mix includes 90 renewables The announcement was in line with UC Rusals pledge to support the sustainable production of aluminium upon joining the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative ASI in 2015

As a response to increased demand for sustainably produced aluminium from major downstream industries  particularly the motor packaging and electronics sectors  Rusal introduced a lowcarbon aluminium brand in November 2017 called Allow According to industry publications the brand includes an independently verified lowcarbon certification program meant to guarantee a maximum carbon footprint of four tones of CO2 per ton of aluminium produced This puts it below the industrys average which is currently estimated to be at 12t per ton of metal produced According to a Reuters report Allow covers roughly 80 percent of Rusals total output

Rusals president Oleg Deripaska has in the past expressed support for introducing steep carbon taxation in order to force other firms away from using coal power and reduce the industrys carbon footprint

Following the 2011 Toho earthquake and tsunami UC Rusal donated 600000 to Japanese childrens and cultural heritage foundations These included the Ashinaga Foundation providing financial and educational support to children the Yul Foundation supporting the learning process and psychological rehabilitation of pupils and donations to the Ishinomori Mangattan Museum in Miyagi Prefecture for the citys reconstruction of cultural attractions

Yury of Zvenigorod
Yury Dmitrievich 26 November 1374 PereslavlZalessky  5 June 1434 also known as George II of Moscow Yury of Zvenigorod and Jurij Zwenihorodski was the second son of Dmitri Donskoi He was the Duke of Zvenigorod and Galich from 1389 until his death During the reign of his brother Vasily I he took part in the campaigns against Torzhok 1392 Zhukotin 1414 and Novgorod 1417 He was the chief orchestrator of the Muscovite Civil War against his nephew Vasily II in the course of which he twice took Moscow in 1433 and 1434

By his wife Anastasia the daughter of Yury of Smolensk Yury had three sons  Vasily Kosoy Dmitry Shemyaka and Dmitry Krasny The marriage to Anastasia made him the brotherinlaw of vitrigaila Grand Duke of Lithuania

At his fathers death Yury received in appanage the towns of Zvenigorod Ruza and Galich

Upon his brothers death Yury immediately asserted his claim to the throne of Muscovy against that of Vasilys son Vasily II He referenced the old house law of the House of Rurik whereby the senior throne in the dynasty passed from brother to brother rather than from father to son He also interpreted in his favour the testament of Dmitri Donskoi written at the time when Vasily had been unmarried and childless

In 1430 Yury and his nephew decided that the issue would be settled in the Golden Horde The Khan supported the claim of Vasily II but allowed Yury to take the appanage of his deceased younger brother Peter of Dmitrov This decision did not fully satisfy Vasily who took Dmitrov by force and expelled Yurys governor from the town in 1432 In response Yury rallied his forces and advanced on PereslavlZalessky Vasily II was defeated on the bank of the Klyazma River and fled to Kostroma After that Yury entered Moscow in triumph and proclaimed himself Grand Duke

Instead of imprisoning his nephew Yury allowed him to settle in Kolomna and rule the town as his appanage This show of magnanimity cost him dearly as scores of Muscovite boyars and noblemen fled to Vasilys court in Kolomna This shift in momentum impelled Yury to conclude a treaty with Vasily whereby the uncle renounced his claims to Moscow promised to deny assistance to his sons and exchanged Dmitrov for other territories Vasily returned to Moscow while Yury withdrew to Galich

The following year Kosoy and Shemyaka defeated Vasily II on the banks of the Kus River The grand prince was informed that Yurys troops had been seen among his enemies and decided to punish him for this treachery In winter 1434 he set Galich ablaze but Yury had escaped northward to Belozersk On 16 March the armies of the uncle and the nephew clashed between Rostov and Pereslavl Vasilys army was roundly defeated and he sought refuge in Nizhny Novgorod

On 31 March 1434 on the Bright Week Wednesday Yury again entered Moscow where he captured Vasilys family and treasury He was preparing a new campaign against Vasily when he died suddenly on 5 July 1434 succeeded by his eldest son Vasily Kosoy

Bosnia and Herzegovina football league system
The Bosnia and Herzegovina football league system is a series of connected leagues for football clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina The system is hierarchical with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels The top division is organized by Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina the second and third levels by entity associations and lower levels by cantonal or regional associations

The Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the top of the structure It is the top flight in Bosnian club football and has 16 teams The League champion is also the champion of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has the right to play in the UEFA Champions League qualifying rounds The bottom two teams of the table are relegated to the second level of competition

The second tier is divided into two leagues  the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the First League of Republika Srpska  containing respectively 16 and 12 clubs Relegated teams from the Premier League are demoted to the secondlevel competition in the next season Geographical location is the criterion for decided decision in which one of these two leagues the teams will play The winner of each league is promoted to the Premier League and bottom teams are relegated The number of relegated teams depends on how many teams enter from the Premier League and the Third Divisions

Thirdlevel football is even more dispersed Each league is associated with a different geographical area In Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina there are four second divisions and in Republika Srpska two second divisions Same principle of promotion and relegation is used so the league winners are promoted to the appropriate secondlevel league and clubs at the bottom of the table are relegated to lower levels

There are cantonal football associations in nine of the ten cantons which make up the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina They each organize clubs into one or more leagues depending on the number of clubs they control In Republika Srpska which has no cantons there are instead four football regions each of which has a league The first leagues in the Federation cantons and the regional leagues in Republika Srpska constitute the fourth level of club football

Further down there are many different types of organization Some cantons with a large number of clubs have second leagues and there are also municipality and intermunicipality leagues for clubs not associated with any cantonal or regional league

Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup usually starts in spring with qualification matches Those matches are played between lower league clubs on canton Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina or region Republika Srpska level Best teams qualify to entity cups which are qualifying competitions for national cup

In the first round of national cup 12 Premier League teams are joined by 12 teams from Federation and 8 teams from Republika Srpska First round is played over one leg while remaining rounds are played over two legs

Alewife Brook Parkway is a short parkway in Cambridge and Somerville Massachusetts It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places It begins at Fresh Pond in Cambridge linking to Fresh Pond Parkway via Concord Avenue and heads north on the east bank of Alewife Brook crossing into West Somerville and ending at the Mystic River on the Medford town line where it becomes Mystic Valley Parkway The entire length of Alewife Brook Parkway is designated as part of Massachusetts Route16 Route16 while the southernmost sections are also designated as part of Route2 and US Route3 US3 It is managed by the Department of Conservation and Recreation with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation responsible for bridge maintenance

The southern terminus of the parkway is the westernmost of the two Fresh Pond rotaries with Concord Avenue connecting the parkway to Fresh Pond Parkway at the eastern rotary The road is designated Massachusetts Routes 2 northbound and 16 eastbound and US Route 3 northbound The parkway runs roughly north skirting just east of the Alewife T station to a large intersection formerly a rotary where the limited access highway carrying Route 2 to the west begins The parkway runs north from this intersection paralleling just east of the course of Alewife Brook which forms the western boundary of Cambridge with Arlington The first major intersection is with Massachusetts Avenue which carries Massachusetts Route 2A eastward toward Porter Square and Routes 2A and 3 westward into Arlington The parkway continues to parallel Alewife Brook as it heads north into Somerville After crossing Broadway the parkway passes through a rotarylike interchange with Powder House Boulevard It then passes Dilboy Stadium on the left and reaches its northern terminus at a small rotary near where Alewife Brook empties into the Mystic River There it meets the Mystic Valley Parkway which runs from Arlington just to the west to Medford to the northeast The Route 16 designation continues northeast The parkways total length is just over two miles about three kilometers

The parkway with the surrounding Alewife Brook Reservation  forms part of Bostons Metropolitan Park District established in 1893 It was originally planned by landscape architect Charles Eliot as one section of a web of pleasure roads designed for their aesthetics Nearby Alewife Brook was straightened and channelized between 1909 and 1912 and construction of the parkway was completed by 1916 Landscaping was performed by the famed Olmsted Brothers firm Route 2 connected to Alewife Brook Parkway as a highway in the present rightofway at some point before 1937

A drivein theatre was built in 1950 replaced by the Fresh Pond Shopping Center in 1962 The current indoor movie theatre next to the shopping center was added in 1964

Along the southern end Alewife Brook Parkway underwent further changes beginning in the late 1980s including a new four lane causeway overpass spanning the Fitchburg line of the Commuter rail new dedicated shoulder turninglanes for exiting and entering the shopping centers enlarged roundabouts with obstructive center trees removed new raised grassy medians down the center of the parkway and new trees light poles and bike lanes integrated into the sidewalks Some of the other amenities integrated in the new design include handicap ramps and stairs on the northbound side of the bridge leading to the Rindge Towers new sidewalk access leading to the Alewife T station Alewife Linear Park bike trail adjacent to Jerrys Pond and a dedicated road for large trucks to service the shopping areas by passing below the overpass

As traffic has grown over the past century the original aesthetics of the parkways southernmost sections have been largely lost It is now the principal connector between Route 2 and the western suburbs on the one hand and downtown Cambridge and Boston on the other and consequently carries a large volume of commuter traffic The Alewife MBTA station is a prominent feature on the parkway and there are shopping centers parking lots and office and apartment buildings lining the parkway between Alewife station and the southern terminus

In February 2010 CBStelevision affiliate WBZ questioned whether the remaining 118 rotaries such as the ones featured at Alewife Brook Parkway and Fresh Pond Parkway should be scrapped across Massachusetts

ParrySullivan invariant
In mathematics the ParrySullivan invariant or ParrySullivan number is a numerical quantity of interest in the study of incidence matrices in graph theory and of certain onedimensional dynamical systems It provides a partial classification of nontrivial irreducible incidence matrices

It is named after the English mathematician Bill Parry and the American mathematician Dennis Sullivan who introduced the invariant in a joint paper published in the journal Topology in 1975

Let A be an n  n incidence matrix Then the ParrySullivan number of A is defined to be

where I denotes the n  n identity matrix

It can be shown that for nontrivial irreducible incidence matrices flow equivalence is completely determined by the ParrySullivan number and the BowenFranks group

International Financial Services District
The International Financial Services District IFSD is a tenyear publicprivate project in Glasgow Scotland Based at Scottish Enterprise the 1 billion venture aims to create an attractive inward investment location for leading international financial services companies and a relocation option for existing Glasgowbased companies seeking to expand their operations

Prior to the launch of the IFSD in 2001 the longterm decline of the old Port of Glasgow and its associated wharves and warehousing had resulted in a neglected infrastructure in Glasgows city centre area fronting the River Clyde otherwise known as the Broomielaw The result was a small number of isolated modern offices standing adjacent to derelict land and vacant dilapidated buildings loosely connected to Glasgows traditional core business district centred on Blythswood Square at the western end of the city centre

Planning led by Scottish Enterprise and Glasgow City Council aimed to create a new dynamic focus for the areas regeneration through the establishment of the IFSD This was an important development of Glasgows financial services sector which with 28000 employees was recognised as vital to the citys economic fortunes In order to develop a fully serviced financial services district and exploit its long term potential significant investment was required to create the right environment

No official boundary of the IFSD exists notionally the term refers to the approximately 1 square kilometer area of the city centre bounded by the M8 motorway to the west the River Clyde the south Hope Street to the east and Sauchiehall Street to the north  taking in most of Blythswood Hill the south eastern fringe of Anderston and part of Charing Cross This has given rise to the areas nicknames in the popular press the Square Kilometre in reference to the square mile of the City of London and more the popular and widely used Wall Street On Clyde

Since the start of the project over 15000 jobs have been created in the area with several of the worlds leading financial companies having a presence in the district

A constant stream of new buildings has appeared in the IFSD since 2001 with more in the pipeline The Aurora building in the IFSD for example has won several UK wide awards as large scale speculative office building

The IFSD is connected by five railway stations with routes that reach regionally and nationally


The IFSD is well connected with two Glasgow Subway stations The Glasgow Subway the worlds third oldest underground metro railway in the world The two stations that cover the IFSD are


The IFSD has links to the nearby M8 Motorway which runs through Central Glasgow The motorway connects the city with Edinburgh Livingston Glasgow Glasgow Airport Paisley Erskine Bridge and Greenock

The Tradeston Bridge completed in 2009 allows quick access by foot or bicycle over the Clyde between the IFSD and the Tradeston district a feature which was previously lacking from the area requiring pedestrians to make a detour via the George V Bridge to reach the same point

Citizens Spanish political party
Citizens      shortened as CsCs until January 2017 officially CitizensParty of the Citizenry CiudadanosPartido de la Ciudadana is a centre to centreright political party in Spain

Originating in Catalonia in 2006 the party received over 25 of votes and 36 deputies in the December 2017 Catalan regional election making it the largest single party in the Parliament of Catalonia Nevertheless it has never taken power so their actual political stance remains a source of controversy between supporters and adversaries beyond their strong opposition to Catalan nationalism of which there is no disputation The party used the phrase Catalonia is my homeland Spain is my country and Europe is our future to outline the partys ideology which the party selfdescribes as postnationalist In spite of that it has deemed by a variety of sources to profess a populist Spanish nationalist ideology

Citizens used to present itself as a centreleft party that offered a mix of socialdemocratic and liberalprogressive positions on its platform but it dropped any mention to social democracy from its principles in February 2017 and by 2018 and 2019 is reported to have experienced a further swing to the right as it began to compete with the PP and later also with Vox to become the leading rightofcentre party in the country It has recently been described by media and CIS a Spanish public research institute as rightoriented A core topic of its platform is opposition to Catalan nationalism

Citizens was formed in Catalonia in July 2006 in response to the call made in a manifesto by a group of wellknown figures in Catalan civic society among them Albert Boadella Flix de Aza Francesc de Carreras and Arcadi Espada in which they called for a new political force to address the real problems faced by the general public In this manifesto they also warned that the rhetoric of hatred promulgated by official Catalan government media against everything Spanish is more alarming than ever and that the Catalan nation promoted as an homogenous entity has taken over the space where an undeniably diverse society lived

In July 2005 this group of personalities almost entirely based in Barcelona formed a political platform called Ciutadans de Catalunya or Citizens of Catalonia They organised several round tables and conferences and by 2006 they had announced the formation of a new political party In their first conference of 2006 Albert Rivera a young lawyer from Barcelona was elected president

In the 2006 elections for the Parliament of Catalonia Cs won 3 of the votes and returned three MPs In the 2010 elections a similar result was achieved 34 3 MPs Mainly as a counter to the growing public support for independence in Catalonia Cs has since further grown substantially in support as one of the most outspoken opponents of this movement In the 2012 snap elections the number of votes more than doubled 76 9 MPs All but one of these seats were in the Province of Barcelona In the 2015 elections Cs more than doubled its votes again 179 25 MPs becoming the second largest faction in the Catalan parliament

In 2013 the party started organising in the rest of Spain with a manifesto called La conjura de Goya Confederacy of Goya that took place in the Congress Palace of Madrid In the 2015 general elections Cs entered parliament with 139 and 40 seats As PPs Mariano Rajoy refused the mandate to form a government Cs promised the secondlargest party PSOE support in parliament in exchange for a number of political concessions However this pact would have needed the support of Podemos and finally did not gain a parliamentarian majority paving the way for a repeat election In the 2016 snap elections Cs lost 08 of the popular vote and 8 seats due to Spains electoral system After these elections Cs could strike a deal with the conservative PP in supporting its government in exchange for a number of political concessions After a 10month political deadlock PP leader Mariano Rajoy was able to become Prime Minister thanks to Cs support and an abstention of PSOE

In the 2014 European elections the party received 316 of the national vote and elected two MEPs Both MEPs joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ALDE group

The party was accepted into the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party on 4 June 2016

At first Citizens branded itself as a centreleft party in its statement of principles ideario While Rivera refused to locate Citizens on the political spectrum for a time he has recently been placing Cs in the political centre Although some observers agreed with the partys ideario by describing Cs as centreleft and others agree with Riveras last definition by describing the party as centrist the vast majority of them have positioned Citizens on the centreright In a 2014 interview Congress spokesman Juan Carlos Girauta explicitly stated that he did not perceive any significant differences between Citizens the centrist Union Progress and Democracy and the farright Spanish nationalist party Vox

Ideologically Cs describes itself as a progressive secular constitutional European federalist and postnationalist political party Ciudadanos rejects the autonomous communities right to selfdetermination outside of the Spanish state As an originally Catalan party it specifically opposes Catalan nationalism due to viewing it as an outdated authoritarian and socially divisive ideology which fuels hatred among both Catalans and Spaniards Rivera uses the phrase Catalonia is my homeland Spain is my country and Europe is our future to describe the partys ideology

The party opposes separatist movements such as the Catalan independence movement and federating the autonomous communities Even though Citizens is currently a supporter of European federalism it ran in the 2009 European Parliament election in coalition with the panEuropean Eurosceptic party Libertas Although reconsidering the current head of state is not a priority for the party Rivera has said that Citizens is a republican party which claims that Spanish citizens are who have to decide whether they prefer a oncemodernized monarchy or a republic through a referendum in the context of a constitutional reform According to its declared identity signs Cs advocates four basic lines of action

Cs displays a political discourse mainly centered around opposition to Catalan nationalism to the extent that it has been frequently criticised for being a single issue party a label rejected by its members In the 20062012 period the number of Cs voters who had voted for centreright parties in previous elections was similar to the number who had voted for centreleft parties suggesting that the partys positions on general economic and social issues are not its main draw Cs criticise any sort of nationalism including the Spanish nationalism that Mr Ynestrillas defends

One of the main issues raised by the party is the Catalan language policy which actively promotes the use of Catalan language as the sole working language of Catalan public administration The party challenges this policy and defends equal treatment of the Spanish and Catalan languages It also opposes the current language policy within the Catalan educational system in accordance with which all public schooling is delivered in Catalan The party also supports strengthening the powers of the Spanish central institutions and curtailing the powers of regional administrations

Other topics include a thorough reform of the electoral system with the aim of creating greater proportionality that would give less weight to single constituencies They also support some changes in the 1978 Constitution especially regarding regional organisation Regarding the chartered autonomous communities tax regimes the party respects and does not want to remove the Basque Countrys and Navarres chartered regimes because it believes that they arent discriminatory in and of themselves However it criticises what it calls the miscalculation of the quota or contribution which is negotiated between governments and has been causing significant differences that they regard as haviing become outrageous It proposes a review and a recalculation of the Basque and Navarrese Economic Agreements in order to stop the Basque Country and Navarre being net beneficiaries Among other policies they also support a regulation of prostitution marijuana and euthanasia

Prominent meetings of the party have been reportedly picketed by Catalan separatist groups on several occasions Its leader Albert Rivera has received anonymous death threats urging him to quit politics Two members of the ERC Youth were sentenced to prison for it Members of Ciudadanos have repeatedly taken part in violent attacks on Catalan targets and farright and ultranationalist groups are usually present in their demonstrations In one instance a Telemadrid cameraman was assaulted allegedly because he was mistaken for a member of Catalan broadcaster TV3 

The Cs outlined some policies for the 2015 general election

Although the party defines itself as postnationalist it has been deemed by a variety of sources including peerreviewed expert texts to profess a populist Spanish nationalist ideology In a party conference held on 20 May 2018 to present its platform Espaa Ciudadana Rivera said in a hall filled with flags of Spain
I do not see reds and blues I see Spaniards I do not see as they say urban people and rural people I see Spaniards I do not see young or old I see Spaniards I do not see workers and entrepreneurs I see Spaniards I do not see believers or agnostics I see Spaniards  So compatriots with Citizens lets go for that Spain lets feel proud of being Spaniards again

In 2006 the newspaper El Peridico de Catalunya revealed that Rivera was a cardcarrying member of the conservative Peoples Party PP between 2002 and 2006 and that he had left the PP only three months before running for election for the Citizens Party This was corroborated by El Mundo and El Pas Despite these revelations Rivera denied having been a full member of PP and implied that he had voted for the PSOE until recently Past PP membership is common among Cs members Former PSC activist Juan Carlos Girauta had joined the PP and became a prolific contributor to conservative journalism from his Libertad Digital column before becoming a Citizens member and candidate in the 2014 European election During his long tenure as Libertad Digital columnist and COPE debater Girauta expressed strong sympathies for rightwing Zionism to the point of calling thenPresident Zapatero an antisemite and lent credibility to the now discredited book by Victor Faras dismissing socialist politician Salvador Allende as a racist and a social Darwinist without clarifying that the quotations about genetic determinism in Allendes doctoral dissertation were themselves quotations from other authors mostly Cesare Lombroso or the fact that Allende was highly critical of these conclusions in his thesis which was later published as a rebuttal to Faras position Faras was later sued for this but Girauta never retracted his statements

In 2015 a member of the Citizens electoral list for Gijn to the city council and regional elections posted proFalangist proBlue Division and proHitler Youth messages on Facebook Those same elections carried news of at least five other former cardcarrying Falange andor Espaa 2000 members

An altercation took place in Canet de Mar on 21 Ma 2018 between proindependence local residents who had planted yellow crosses on the beach to honor imprisoned and fugitive politicians and antiindependence individuals who decided to remove said crosses The altercation left at least three people wounded including an 82yearold man and a local CUP councilor who explicitly accused Citizens and Falange militants from across the whole region to be among the provocateurs Citizens Member of Parliament Carlos Carrizosa dismissed the claim that either councillors or party activists from the party were involved in the incidents Four days later and despite admonishments and warnings by President of the Parliament Roger Torrent Carrizosa himself removed a yellow ribbon from the seats reserved for absent Cabinet ministers forcing the President to suspend the entire session

During the 2006 Catalan election campaign the partys president Albert Rivera appeared completely naked in a poster in order to attract publicity to the party In the beginning the party frequently complained about an alleged boycott on the part of Catalan media in their opinion the party was given too little airtime to present its views on the Catalan public television

In 2009 it was announced that Cs would run for the European election allied with the Libertas coalition The partys association with Declan Ganleys Libertas platform raised some concern on account of the coalition formed by the latter with nationalist and ultranationalist parties in each of its local European chapters seemingly at odds with the professed ideology of Cs

Several intellectuals that had participated in the formation of Ciutadans later withdrew their support For instance Albert Boadella became one of the cofounders of the Union Progress and Democracy UPyD party led by former Basque Socialist politician Rosa Dez
According to some members of Cs the negotiations prior to this electoral pact were led personally and secretly by the party leader Albert Rivera This alienated the other two MPs besides Rivera himself and a significant part of the party from his leadership In turn the official stance of Cs is that the critics are using the dispute as a pretext to canvass support for the ideologically similar UPyD

Albert Rivera has chosen his economic head Luis Garicano to lead Citizens in the 2019 European elections 

A credit was requested for party funding in 2015 to Banco Popular Espaol up to 2017 an IBEX 35 member

In 2017 the Court of Audit found irregularities in the accounting books of several political groups Citizens among them In respect of Citizens the irregularities included illegal expenses for advertising on local television in 2015

Cs member Jorge Soler appeared in December 2017 on the TV3 debate Preguntes freqents during which journalist addressed him about the 21 million euros spent by Cs in the 21D Catalan election campaignhigher than the budget spent by any other party on that election Talegn inquired about the sources of this funding Soler replied that this ample budget could be ascribed to the austerity of their party

Agnes Baldwin Alexander 18751971 was an American author and a member of the Bah Faith

Agnes Baldwin Alexander was born July 21 1875 in the Kingdom of Hawaii She was the youngest of five children born to William De Witt Alexander and Abigail Charlotte ne Baldwin Alexander The Alexanders were a scion of two of Hawaiis most illustrious Christian missionary familiesthe Alexanders and the Baldwins Her father was one of Hawaiis most famous men as President of Oahu College author of A Brief History of the Hawaiian People and first SurveyorGeneral of the Hawaiian Islands

Alexander graduated from Oahu College in 1875 later doing undergraduate work at Oberlin College and UC Berkeley After teaching for a few years she fell prey to chronic illness In 1900 she joined a group of Islanders who were going on a tour of Europe In November 1900 She was in Rome where she encountered an American Bah woman and her two daughters who were returning from a Bah pilgrimage in the Holy Land then called Syria As the result of an epiphany one night which she described as neither a dream nor vision she embraced the Bah Revelation and accepted its new Manifestation Bahullh whose name means The Glory of God

At the request of Bahullhs eldest son AbdulBaha Miss Alexander pioneered the Bah Faith in Japan in 1914 In 1921 she became the first to introduce the New Gospel in Korea Except for extended vacations in Hawaii Agnes spent over thirty years in Japan

Alexander became an early advocate of Esperanto and used that new international language to spread the Bah teachings at meetings and conferences

At the request of Bahullhs greatgrandson Agnes Alexander wrote two histories Forty Years of the Bah Cause in Hawaii 19021942 and History of the Bah Faith in Japan 19141938 Both of these volumes were published posthumously

In 1957 the head of the Bah Faith Shoghi Effendi Rabbani appointed Agnes Alexander a Hand of the Cause of God the highest rank one may hold as an individual Bah

In 1964 Alexander represented the Universal House of Justice the supreme administrative body of the Bah Faith at the election of Hawaiis first National Spiritual Assembly in Honolulu After suffering a broken hip in 1965 and spending two years in a Tokyo hospital Agnes Alexander returned home to Honolulu in 1967 Ironically the Arcadia residence where she passed her last four years was adjacent to her birthplace on Punahou Street

On January 1 1971 Alexander died She was buried behind Kawaiahao Church with her missionary forebears

Agnes Alexander is related to several notable people including Amos Starr Cooke David Dwight Baldwin William Owen Smith Samuel T Alexander Henry P Baldwin Annie Montague Alexander and others Her parents were William D Alexander and Abigail Baldwin and grandparents William P Alexander and Mary Ann McKinney from her father and Dwight Baldwin and Charlotte Fowler through her mother

Alexander wrote one book on the history of the Bah Faith in Japan and was covered in detail by a number of other books

Royal Flush game
Royal Flush is a solitaire card game which is played with a deck of 52 playing cards The game is so called because the aim of the game is to end up with a royal flush of any suit However the game is so much mechanical in nature that there is currently no electronic or computer implementation Its rules are so far included in printed matter such as The Complete Book of Solitaire and Patience Games by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey MottSmith and 100 Best Solitaire Games by Sloane Lee and Gabriel Packard

First the deck is dealt into five piles two piles of eleven cards and three piles of ten The player first turns the first pile up and looks for either an ace a ten a king a queen and a jack cards which comprise a royal flush Once such a card is found the search ends there with the cards on top of it discarded and those under it left alone The search then proceeds into the next pile and the search for other cards in the royal flush continues Also the suit of the first card found determines the suit of the entire royal flush When a pile contains no card of the royal flush being searched the entire pile is discarded When another royalflush card is found in a pile the search continues until all five piles are searched and royalflush cards are at the top of their piles

Afterwards the piles are placed on top of each other in the reverse direction of the deal So if the deal is from left to right once the search ends each pile is placed on its neighbor to the left Morehead and MottSmiths rule said stated that the piles should be turned face down first before the piles are gathered The discarded cards are set aside

Then without shuffling the remaining cards are dealt this time into four piles After this the search the cards of the royal flush begins again with the same procedure already stated above Once all four piles are searched and regathered the remaining cards again without reshuffling are dealt into three piles The process continues and after the gathering of the piles the cards are dealt into two piles and the procedure begins once more

When the two piles are regathered the remaining cards at this point are then dealt into a single pile Even at this point the search stops when a royalflush card is found and the cards on top of it are discarded The game is won when the cards of the royal flush are the only ones left in the pile and are arranged in any order If there are any other cards sandwiched among the royal flush cards the game is lost

To give the game some variation Lee and Packard in their book 100 Best Solitaire Games suggests the player to try other poker hands such as fourofakinds full houses or straight flushes The player can simply look for a specific hand or look for certain cards to include in hisher hand while playing the game

MBC Dynamo Moscow
MBC Dynamo Moscow  was a Russian professional basketball team from Moscow The club was active for 93 years from 1923 until 2016 before being dissolved due to financial problems The club had several successful years in the highest division in Russian basketball In 2006 Dynamo won a European trophy in the Eurocup

Created in 1923 when Russia was part of the Soviet Union Dynamo is among the oldest sports clubs in the country Its name was chosen because Dynamo means power in motion The club was backed by the State Political Directorate GPU a police apparatus of the USSR That is why the team has always been thought of as the police club while crosstown rival CSKA Moscow was the army club Dynamo quickly earned a reputation outside the Soviet Union borders due to its success in major sports such as football handball ice hockey and of course basketball Dynamo Moscow won the USSR League championship in 1937 and 1948 and also made it to the final in 1944 and 1990

Over the decades Dynamo earned a reputation for being among the strongest teams nationally and around the continent Dynamo finished third in the Soviet Union League standings in 1946 1957 and 1958 as well as making it to the 1952 USSR Cup final Years of domestic obscurity followed in which the team could not achieve any remarkable domestic success A few former Dynamo players participated in some of the most historic moments in USSR sport Aleksandr Boloshev was a member of the Olympic Team that won the gold medal in Munich 1972 Furthermore Vladimir Zhigili one of the most famous players in Dynamos history was World Champion in Puerto Rico in 1974

The team found new success outside its domestic borders in the mid1990s Dynamo made it all the way to the Cup Winners Cup semifinal in 1991 losing to eventual champ PAOK Thessaloniki The team also qualified for the Kora Cup in 1992 1994 and 1995 without much success despite having players like Sergei Bazarevich Pavel Astakhov Sergei Babenko or Evgeniy Pashutin Things changed in 1996 however as Dynamo shone in the 1996 Saporta Cup The club brought in players like Bazarevich Vitaly Nosov and Valeri Daineko Dynamo went all the way from the previous round survived the group stage and made it to the bestofthree semifinals playoffs TAU Cermica swept the series with an 8798 road win in Moscow and a 10493 home triumph in Vitoria and it went on to win the title against PAOK Thessaloniki The club could not live up to the expectations and one year after that in 1997 Dynamo Moscow disappeared due to financial reasons despite having played the Euroleague for the first time in club history

It was not until 2001 when Dynamo reappeared in the Russian basketball scene MBC Dynamo Moscow was created under the support of the Dynamo society and its chairman Vladimir Pronichev Dynamo entered the Russian League second division in the 200102 season and won the title that very same year returning to the elite of Russian basketball The club had to face new financial problems but once again the Dynamo organization led by chairman Viktor Zakharov and his assistant Vladimir Mikhalevsky stepped up to solve all troubles and give the team the economic stability it needed MBC Dynamo Moscow joined the Dynamo organization in Moscow City and found a new president in his excoach Evgeny Gomelsky brother of the legendary coach and former CSKA president the late Alexander Gomelsky Dynamo finished sixth in the 200203 Russian League with players like Nikita Morgunov Martin Mrsepp Bazarevich Aleksander Milosserdov or Dmitri Domani who remains now as the team captain Dynamo did even better in the 200304 season in which players like Nikos Ekonomou Jimmy Oliver Nikolay Padius Damir Mri and the late Kenyon Jones helped the team to make it to the Russian League semifinals
Dynamo continues taking steps forward and making a big financial effort to incorporate some of the best European players in the market As such for 200405 Dynamo signed the Euroleague alltime top rebounder Mirsad Trkcan the 200304 Euroleague regular season top scorer Lynn Greer center Lazaros Papadopoulos and solid wellrounded veterans such as Ariel McDonald Trajan Langdon Kytof Lavrinovi and Andrei Fetisov Dynamo won difficult Group D in the ULEB Cup regular season and was considered a top candidate to go far in the elimination rounds especially when the team won the first leg of the twoway eighthfinals series on the road against Hemofarm 8184 but lost 9675 on their own home court Dynamo once again has a competitive roster in which Papadopoulos Domani and Valentin Koubrakov returned to be joined by some teamoriented players such as Ruben Douglas Mire Chatman Bojan Popovi Hanno Mttl and Antonis Fotsis Moreover Dynamo landed one of the best head coaches in European basketball history none other than the legendary Duan Ivkovi With the right environment a solid roster a great coach and the hunger to win its firstever European title in 2006 the team won the ULEB Cup
In 2006 the club moved to its new arena in the Krylatskoe Sports Center In the 20062007 season Dynamo competed in the ULEB Euroleague reaching the quarterfinals under monster efforts from Fotsis and Papadopoulos They lost to Panathinaikos BC 02 A poor finish in domestic competition 4th place lead the team returning to the ULEB Cup Before the 20072008 season coach Ivkovi was replaced by Svetislav Pei and players like Milo Vujani Henry Domercant and Robertas Javtokas who replaced Papadopoulos were signed Heavy favorites to win Dynamo struggled  they made the ULEB Cup Final Eight but lost in the semifinals to CB Girona 7881 in a huge shock which lead to the firing of Pei He was replaced by Sergei Bazarevich Dynamo finished in 3rd place in the PBL In the 20082009 season David Blatt became head coach and solid NBA players like Jannero Pargo and Botjan Nachbar were signed along with stars in Europe like Hollis Price and Darju Lavrinovi Dynamo was a heavy favorite to win the EuroCup Basketball tournament formerly the ULEB Cup Despite playing solidly most of the way Dynamo was plagued by financial problems  Price and Pargo left the team in January with Brian Chase signing to replace Price Still a favorite to win the EuroCup Dynamo suffered a fiasco in the Final Eight tournament losing to Hemofarm 8593 in the quarterfinals In the PBL Dynamo finished in a disastrous 6th place The next two seasons 20092010 and 20102011 Dynamo didnt have any success in European competition never reaching the playoffs in either the EuroCup and the FIBA EuroChallenge tournaments In the PBL Dynamo finished in 4th place in 20092010 thanks in most part due to efforts by Sergey Monya and Alexey Shved In 20102011 in the PBL Dynamo finished only in 9th place 

On June 18 2011 the club was expelled from the PBL From then the club was playing in the second division the Super League 1 Dynamo also briefly played in the BBL but left early do to financial difficulties The team left the Super League in 2015 and was dissolved a year later

C More Tennis was a Scandinavian premium sports channel which replaced Canal Sport 2 on September 4 2012 and became a sports channel with only tennis from ATP Tour WTA Tour and Davis Cup The channel also has the rights to the Grand Slam tournament Wimbledon

The channel is available

In Sweden through the C More packets C More Max C More Sports and C More Family 

In Norway through the C More packets C More Total and C More Sports

In Finland through the package MTV3 Total

However it was not meaningful in the first place that the channel should be available in Denmark since Canal 8 Sport substituted C More Sports and Tennis would be shown there but the channel is available through C More Film package from Canal Digital YouSee and Altibox together with C More Extreme 
But in early 2013 it was recognized that there was not always room till all tennis tournaments on Canal 8 Sport so that the channel was in March 2013 made available through YouSee where the channel could be optional as an additional channel to 30  DKR Also C More Extreme was made an additional channel to 30  DKR

The channel got in early 2013 the rights to the WTA Tour but only in Sweden Norway and Finland in Denmark TV3 Sport 2 have the rights So the WTA Tour transmissions will be blocked in Denmark together with The Grand Slam tournament Wimbledon which also TV3 Sport 2 has the rights to

Kryptopterus
Kryptopterus is a genus of catfishes belonging to the family Siluridae They are found in freshwater throughout Southeast Asia The scientific name comes from Ancient Greek krypts  hidden  ptryx  fin It refers to the reduced or even entirely absent dorsal fin of these catfishes

These small to mediumsized catfishes have opaque transparent or translucent bodies hence their common name Asian glass catfishes Despite this name only three described species have clearly transparent bodies K minor K piperatus and K vitreolus Most significant among these is the ghost catfish K vitreolus which is the glass catfish most often seen in the aquarium fish trade This species was initially confused with the larger glass catfish K bicirrhis infrequent in aquarium trade and subsequently with K minor essentially absent from aquarium trade This matter was only fully resolved in 2013

While 18 species have been described as of 2013 the genus Kryprtopterus is notoriously rich in cryptic species A number of these have been recognized in recent years and more are likely to follow

Some species formerly placed in Kryptopterus are nowadays in other Siluridae genera in particular Phalacronotus but also Micronema and Pterocryptis

Automatic sequence
In mathematics and theoretical computer science an automatic sequence also called a kautomatic sequence or a krecognizable sequence when one wants to indicate that the base of the numerals used is k is an infinite sequence of terms characterized by a finite automaton The nth term of an automatic sequence an is a mapping of the final state reached in a finite automaton accepting the digits of the number n in some fixed basek

An automatic set is a set of nonnegative integers S for which the sequence of values of its characteristic function  is an automatic sequence that is S is kautomatic if n is kautomatic where n  1 if nformula1S and 0 otherwise

Automatic sequences may be defined in a number of ways all of which are equivalent Four common definitions are as follows

Let k be a positive integer and let D  Q   q   be a deterministic finite automaton with output where

Extend the transition function  from acting on single digits to acting on strings of digits by defining the action of  on a string s consisting of digits sss as

Define a function a from the set of positive integers to the output alphabet  as follows

where sn is n written in base k Then the sequence a  a1a2a3 is a kautomatic sequence

An automaton reading the base k digits of sn starting with the most significant digit is said to be direct reading while an automaton starting with the least significant digit is reverse reading The above definition holds whether sn is direct or reverse reading

Let  be a kuniform morphism of a free monoid  and let  be defined as in the automatatheoretic case If w is a fixed point of that is if w  wthen s  w is a kautomatic sequence This result is due to Cobham and it is referred to in the literature as Cobhams theorem Conversely every kautomatic sequence is obtainable in this way

Let k2 The kkernel of the sequence sn is the set of subsequences
In most cases the kkernel of a sequence is infinite However if the kkernel is finite then the sequence sn is kautomatic

It follows that a kautomatic sequence is necessarily a sequence on a finite alphabet

Let un be a sequence over an alphabet  and suppose that there is an injective function  from  to the finite field F where q  p for some prime p The associated formal power series is 
Then the sequence u is qautomatic if and only if this formal power series is algebraic over FX This result is due to Christol and it is referred to in the literature as Christols theorem

Automatic sequences were introduced by Bchi in 1960 although his paper took a more logicotheoretic approach to the matter and did not use the terminology found in this article The notion of automatic sequences was further studied by Cobham in 1972 who called these sequences uniform tag sequences

The term automatic sequence first appeared in a paper of Deshouillers

The following sequences are automatic

The ThueMorse sequence tn  is the fixed point of the morphism 0  01 1  10 Since the nth term of the ThueMorse sequence counts the number of ones modulo 2 in the base2 representation of n it is generated by the twostate deterministic finite automaton with output pictured here where being in state q indicates there are an even number of ones in the representation of n and being in state q indicates there are an odd number of ones
Hence the ThueMorse sequence is 2automatic

The nth term of the perioddoubling sequence dn  is determined by the parity of the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing n It is also the fixed point of the morphism 0  01 1  00 Starting with the initial term w  0 and iterating the 2uniform morphism  on w where 0  01 and 1  00 it is evident that the perioddoubling sequence is the fixedpoint of w and thus it is 2automatic

The nth term of the RudinShapiro sequence rn  is determined by the number of consecutive ones in the base2 representation of n The 2kernel of the RudinShapiro sequence is 
Since the 2kernel consists only of rn r2n1 r4n3 and r8n3 it is finite and thus the RudinShapiro sequence is 2automatic

Both the BaumSweet sequence  and the regular paperfolding sequence  are automatic In addition the general paperfolding sequence with a periodic sequence of folds is also automatic

Automatic sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties A nonexhaustive list of these properties is presented below


kautomatic sequences are normally only defined for k2 The concept can be extended to k  1 by defining a 1automatic sequence to be a sequence whose nth term depends on the unary notation for n that is 1 Since a finite state automaton must eventually return to a previously visited state all 1automatic sequences are ultimately periodic

Automatic sequences are robust against variations to either the definition or the input sequence For instance as noted in the automatatheoretic definition a given sequence remains automatic under both direct and reverse reading of the input sequence A sequence also remains automatic when an alternate set of digits is used or when the base is negated that is when the input sequence is represented in base k instead of in base k However in contrast to using an alternate set of digits a change of base may affect the automaticity of a sequence

The domain of an automatic sequence can be extended from the natural numbers to the integers via twosided automatic sequences This stems from the fact that given k2 every integer can be represented uniquely in the form formula5 where formula6 Then a twosided infinite sequence an is kautomatic if and only if its subsequences an and an are kautomatic

The alphabet of a kautomatic sequence can be extended from finite size to infinite size via kregular sequences

Dolle Dinsdag
Dolle Dinsdag Mad Tuesday took place in the Netherlands on 5 September 1944 after broadcasts alleging that Breda had been liberated caused rumours to spread across the occupied Netherlands that the liberation by Allied forces was at hand prompting celebrations

On 4 September 1944 the Allies had conquered Antwerp and it was thought that they already advanced into the Netherlands Radio Oranje broadcasts one by the Prime Ministerinexile Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy increased the confusion twice in just over twelve hours at 2345 on 4 September and again in the morning of the 5th they announced that Breda 8 kilometers from the border with Holland had been liberated though in fact this success was achieved only on 29 October 1944 by forces of 1st Polish Armoured Division of General Maczek The news spread rapidly with underground newspapers preparing headlines announcing the fall of Breda 

The German occupiers Arthur SeyssInquart appointed Reichskommissar for the Occupied Netherlands in May 1940 and Hanns Albin Rauter SS and police leader increased speculation by announcing a State of Siege for the Netherlands to the 300000 cable radio listeners and in the newspapers of the following dayThe population must maintain order  it is strictly forbidden to flee areas that are threatened by the enemy All orders from the military commanders must be strictly adhered to and without question  any resistance to the occupation forces will be suppressed with force of weaponry Any attempt to fraternize with the enemy or to hinder the German Reich and its allies in any form will be dealt with harshly perpetrators will be shot

Despite the threats many Dutchmen celebrated on the streets while preparing to receive and cheer on the Allied liberators Dutch and Orange flags and pennants were prepared and many workers left their workplace to wait for the Allies to arrive The extent of this optimism as measure of Dutch attitudes to Occupation has been hard for historians to gauge in the absence of any contemporary surveys but it can be discerned as significant by researchers accessing diaries and finding an increase in births in statistics nine months after Dolle Dinsdag German occupation forces and NSB members panicked documents were destroyed and many fled the Netherlands for Germany Ary Willem Gijsbert Koppejan 19192013 a member of the resistance organisation De Ondergedoken Camera the Underground Camera secretly photographed German troops fleeing the city and soldiers and collaborators waiting at the Den Haag railway station on Dolle Dinsdag

The Allied advance could not continue as the Allies had overextended themselves and had to halt in the South of the Netherlands and Operation Market Garden in September was an outright failure since the planned Allied advance across the Rhine had to be abandoned The occupiers nervousness turned to aggression after the landings in Normandy in June 1944 and increased after Dolle Dinsdag Due to this defeat the liberation of the remaining Dutch territory was postponed until the next spring and the northern part of the Netherlands had to wait until 5 May 1945 for their liberation This last terrible winter under occupation became known as the Hunger Winter killing approximately 25000 victims mostly elder males though the toll from its related health effects is likely higher

Mad Tuesday caused the railway strikes of 1944 that started on 17 September with the code De kinderen van Versteeg moeten onder de wol translation the children of Versteeg must get under the woolgo to bed The strike would last until the complete Netherlands was liberated on 5 May 1945 the governmentinexile thought that by spreading rumors the Germans would start to panic It worked and by announcing the railway strike of 1944 the Germans started to panic even more and many Germans and Dutch collaborators fled to Germany fearing reprisals SeyssInquart had already set the example on September 3 he had sent his wife to Salzburg The industry and supply route from and to Germany was almost completely stopped which made it even harder for Germany to defend what still was occupied

The originator of the phrase Dolle Dinsdag is presumed to be Willem van den Hout alias Willem W Waterman who first used it in a headline in the September 15 issue of his magazine De Gil The Yell with 200000 subscribers though it had likely emerged in general usage before that De Gil satirised the NSB the German occupiers and the Dutch governmentinexile but was actually funded by the Hauptabteilung fr Volksaufklrung und Propaganda the German propaganda department

Concept development and experimentation
Concept development and experimentation CDE is the application of the structure and methods of experimental science to the challenge of developing future military capability 

CDE is a forwardlooking process for developing and evaluating new concepts before committing extensive resources CDE is a process to identify the best solution not only from a technical perspective but also for possible solutions for challenges involving doctrine organization training and material to achieve significant advances in future operations CDE is a way of thinking your way through the future before spending money

Developing and identifying futureoriented concepts allows one to

The potential impacts on interoperability and increased capabilities by emerging concepts must be captured by some process and exploited

Concept development gives broad and sometimes illdefined ideas a chance to be examined by groups of experts in a logical process These ideas can come from different sources eg Ministry of Defense industry servicemen organizations or partners They can be generated by staff processes operational experience formal analytical work or published proposals There need be no boundaries on the types of ideas that enter the concept development process although some simpler ones that modify techniques or procedures might be fasttracked into practice because they are intuitively sound Typically promising ideas with a broader scope are explored and refined through workshops and larger seminars to the point where more mature concepts are formed These concepts are further debated in committees or working groups and if accepted are submitted to the experimental process 

Different kinds of experiments can be conducted 

Once validated and accepted concepts are incorporated into military organizations  for example through doctrine and capability development processes

<doc id="7740467" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7740467" title="Etymology of chemistry">
Etymology of chemistry
In the history of science the etymology of the word chemistry is debatable It is agreed that the word derives from the word alchemy which is a European one derived from kimiya  and alchemy alkmiy  The Arabic term is derived from the Ancient Greek khmia or khmeia However the ultimate origin of the root word chem is uncertain

According to the Oxford English Dictionary alkmiy is derived from  which is derived from the ancient Egyptian name of Egypt khem or khm khame or khmi meaning blackness Therefore alchemy is the Black Art However it is also possible that alkmiy derived from  meaning cast together

There are two main views on the derivation of the word which agree in holding that it has an Arabic descent the prefix al being the Arabic article But according to one the second part of the word comes from the Greek  pouring infusion used in connexion with the study of the juices of plants and thence extended to chemical manipulations in general this derivation accounts for the oldfashioned spellings chymist and chymistry The other view traces it to khem or khame hieroglyph khmi which denotes black earth as opposed to barren sand and occurs in Plutarch as  on this derivation alchemy is explained as meaning the Egyptian art The first occurrence of the word is said to be in a treatise of Julius Firmicus an astrological writer of the 4th century but the prefix al there must be the addition of a later copyist In English Piers Plowman 1362 contains the phrase experimentis of alconomye with variants alkenemye and  alknamye The prefix al began to be dropped about the middle of the 16th century further details of which are given below

According to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge the Arabic word alkmiya actually means the Egyptian science borrowing from the Coptic word for Egypt kme or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic khme This Coptic word derives from Demotic km itself from ancient Egyptian kmt The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black Egypt was the Black Land by contrast with the Red Land the surrounding desert so this etymology could also explain the nickname Egyptian black arts However according to Mahn this theory may be an example of folk etymology Assuming an Egyptian origin chemistry is defined as follows

Thus according to Budge and others chemistry derives from an Egyptian word khemein or khmia preparation of black powder ultimately derived from the name khem Egypt A decree of Diocletian written about 300 AD in Greek speaks against the ancient writings of the Egyptians which treat of the khmia transmutation of gold and silver

Arabic alkmiya or alkhmiya  or  according to some is thought to derive from the Koine Greek word khymeia  meaning the art of alloying metals alchemy in the manuscripts this word is also written khmeia  or kheimeia  which is the probable basis of the Arabic form According to Mahn the Greek word  khumeia originally meant pouring together casting together weld alloy etc cf Gk kheein  to pour khuma  that which is poured out an ingot Assuming a Greek origin chemistry is defined as follows

Later medieval Latin had alchimia  alchymia alchemy alchimicus alchemical and alchimista alchemist The mineralogist and humanist Georg Agricola died 1555 was the first to drop the Arabic definite article al In his Latin works from 1530 on he exclusively wrote chymia and chymista in describing activity that we today would characterize as chemical or alchemical As a humanist Agricola was intent on purifying words and returning them to their classical roots He had no intent to make a semantic distinction between chymia and alchymia

During the later sixteenth century Agricolas new coinage slowly propagated It seems to have been adopted in most of the vernacular European languages following Conrad Gessners adoption of it in his extremely popular pseudonymous work Thesaurus Euonymi Philiatri De remediis secretis Liber physicus medicus et partim etiam chymicus Zurich 1552 Gessners work was frequently republished in the second half of the 16th century in Latin and was also published in a number of vernacular European languages with the word spelled without the al

In the 16th and 17th centuries in Europe the forms alchimia and chimia and chymia were synonymous and interchangeable The semantic distinction between a rational and practical science of chimia and an occult alchimia arose only in the early eighteenth century

In 16th 17th and early 18th century English the spellings  both with and without the al  were usually with an i or y as in chimic  chymic  alchimic  alchymic During the later 18th century the spelling was refashioned to use a letter e as in chemic in English In English after the spelling shifted from chimical to chemical there was corresponding shift from alchimical to alchemical which occurred in the early 19th century In French Italian Spanish and Russian today it continues to be spelled with an i as in for example Italian chimica

Metaphor Computer Systems
Metaphor Computer Systems 19821994 was a Xerox PARC spinoff that created an advanced workstation database gateway a unique graphical office interface and software applications that communicate The Metaphor machine was one of the first commercial workstations to offer a complete hardwaresoftware package and a GUI Although the company achieved some commercial success it never achieved the fame of either the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows

David Liddle and Donald Massaro founded Metaphor in 1982 after leaving Xerox PARC By 1987 the company had an annual revenue of 397 million In 1991 IBM one of its primary customers acquired the company outright

The Metaphor workstation had a wireless keyboard wireless mouse wireless numeric pad and a wireless 5function keypad All these input devices docked in the desktop workstation where they were recharged Objects on the desktop and open applications had a uniform command set that could be controlled by the keypad which had Copy Move Delete Options and Size Workstations were connected with Ethernet The industrial design of the workstation was done by Mike Nutall of Matrix Product Design It won a gold medal from the IDSA The workstation itself was engineered by James Yurchenco at David Kelley Design Both Matrix and David Kelley Design were precursors of IDEO

Two different workstations models were produced Workstation One had an external electronics enclosure Workstation Two had integrated electronics A Workstation Three which included a color screen was designed through final prototypes but was never taken into production

Xerox PARC in 1973 began development of the Alto widely shown in 1979 The Alto was the first computer with a bitmap display mouse and a desktop metaphor as a graphical user interface GUI Xerox commercialized it as the Xerox Star

The Metaphor GUI provided a unique visualization of endtoend elements in an enterprise In total Metaphor branded this as a Data Interpretation System DIS which is a class of Decision Support System DSS 
The DIS software was designed to show in one workflow the access of data from SQL databases its analysis and then its presentation This was accomplish by using graphically iconic applications for database gateway spreadsheet plot email and printing tools all connected by arrows These were animated when the workflow ran The workflow collection was called a Capsule

The heart of the Metaphor DIS system was the Capsule Basically a capsule was a simplified BATCH program Because Metaphor applications were built so they communicated with each other they could be moved into a folder and automated in a Capsule The name was taken from the manned space capsules of the time

The functionality of the Word Processor Spreadsheet and Data Retrieval tools were no better than their Microsoft Office counterparts in fact they had a smaller subset of features than Office The primary advantage of Metaphors system was the degree to which applications were linked together Complex reiterative dataretrieval jobs were able to be created onthefly by a user with no programming knowledge

A user could visually drag fields from multiple databases into the Data Retrieval tool which would generate its own SQL code based on the fields links and criteria displayed and send the output directly into a spreadsheet for sorting calculations and graphs The report could then be sent into a preformatted Word Processing document sent to the printer and even emailed to a predesignated distribution list The whole process would repeat for each SKU Region Price Code etc without any human interaction

Even in todays GUI designs this abstract conception of the desktop has never been attempted because it requires the interoperation of every application a uniform dataflow model and a communication protocol usable by a supervisor in a programmatic way

In March 2000 IBM licensed the Metaphor IBM Intelligent Decision Server IDS technology to Relational Development Systems RDS which was renamed Meta5

Metaphor and IBM created a venture called Patriot Partners in 1990 The attempt was to create an organization that could produce a solid business line of objectoriented software Rather than capitalize the venture IBM purchased the Metaphor software division in 1991 and operated it as a wholly owned independent subsidiary and the hardware and field repair division was spun off into its own company Sequence Support Services In May 1992 Sequence Support Services ceased operations In October 1994 Metaphor ceased operations

Hurricane Dean 1989
Hurricane Dean was the fourth named storm and second hurricane of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season Dean formed on July 31 and reached tropical storm status the following day east of the Leeward Islands Dean brushed the northern Leeward Islands as a Category 1 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale bringing light rain but producing no damage before turning northward and striking Bermuda as a Category 2 hurricane Dean continued northward before making landfall in southeastern Newfoundland

Since Dean was initially difficult to forecast it posed a possible threat to the Lesser Antilles as a result several evacuations occurred and many hurricane watches and warning were issued However as Dean turned northward all watches and warnings in the Lesser Antilles were discontinued As Dean approached Bermuda a hurricane watch was issued and was later upgraded to a hurricane warning After Dean tracked away from the island the hurricane warning was discontinued In addition a hurricane warning was briefly in effect for Sable Island Nova Scotia The storm left 89million 1989USD  USD and sixteen injuries across Bermuda but no fatalities were reported In Atlantic Canada Dean dropped light rain across Nova Scotia and Sable Island

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified using the Dvorak Technique by satellite analysts at the National Hurricane Center in part due to persistent deep convection Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that the National Hurricane Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles The depression moved westward at 17mph 28kmh intensifying as it did so and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm which was named Dean by the National Hurricane Center

Continuing generally westward Dean continued to gradually intensify and became a hurricane on August 2 after an Air Force reconnaissance flight had recorded hurricaneforce winds The following day a decreasing ridge of high pressure to the north and a trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States caused Dean to slow in its forward motion and turn northwest The trough of low pressure forming off the East Coast of the United States was deepening causing Dean to curve northward while remaining nearly stationary After remaining nearly stationary Dean began to accelerate to a forward speed of 17mph 28kmh as it headed toward Bermuda Thereafter Dean intensified into a Category 2 hurricane whilst the eastern half of the eyewall brushed Bermuda Dean continued to intensify slightly after passing the island of Bermuda and became a Category 2 hurricane on August 7 While Dean was a Category 2 hurricane it attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph 165kmh and a minimum pressure of 968mbar hPa 2859inHg

After peak intensity the forward speed of Dean continued to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane While approaching southern Newfoundland Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8 Shortly thereafter Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph 105kmh Later that day Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day

Hurricane Dean was very difficult to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands the track prediction models were not consistent and as a result uncertainty existed in justifying the posting of watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays

Regardless the National Hurricane Center issued hurricane warnings for Guadeloupe on August 2 and the rest of the Leeward Islands extending to the Virgin Islands The uncertainty of the hurricanes forecast track forced residents and tourists in the Lesser Antilles to evacuate In the British Virgin Islands 80 American and Canadian tourists evacuated to hotels In Puerto Rico residents were advised to secure or stow away loose objects and stock up on emergency supplies 11million residents in the city of San Juan went to supermarkets to get much needed supplies in anticipation that the storm might hit Puerto Rico In Humacao the National Guard evacuated 1966 people living along a coastal highway The islands of Martinique and Dominica were placed under a hurricane watch The warning for Guadeloupe was discontinued at 2200 UTC when the hurricane posed no threat to the island Simultaneously the hurricane watches in effect for Martinique and Dominica were also discontinued As Dean continued westward the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Turks and Caicos Islands The watch was soon canceled as Dean made its northward turn towards Bermuda

In Bermuda the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch on August 5 The hurricane watch was later changed to a hurricane warning the following day Deans approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights In Atlantic Canada the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory

The outer bands of Hurricane Dean produced heavy rainfall and winds up to 75mph 121kmh across Antigua and Barbuda There was no reported damage in the Leeward Islands or the Virgin Islands since the hurricane turned northward In the Atlantic a sailboat bound for Bermuda was caught off guard by the hurricane The boat which carried no radio equipment was spotted by a hurricane hunter plane The occupants of the boat suffered no injuries In Bermuda the hurricanes eastern eyewall produced 81mph 130kmh sustained winds with gusts up to 113mph 182kmh Bermuda highest rainfall total from Dean was 245in 508mm while parts of the island received 35in 762127mm of rain

Strong winds from Hurricane Dean caused considerable power line damage leaving 65000 residents without electricity The winds also caused minor roof damage In Hamilton Harbor 20 pleasure boats were damaged or sent adrift due to the rough seas Flooding from the hurricane damaged fifteen houses Sixteen people were injured by the hurricane five of the injuries were considered serious There were however no reports of fatalities from Deans impact on Bermuda Damage in Bermuda amounted up to 89million 1989USD  USD

Although Dean remained away from the United States coastline it produced storm tides of 17ft 051m to North Carolina In Atlantic Canada hurricaneforce winds were reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island Newfoundland reported winds of only 50mph 80kmh Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1in 254mm of precipitation Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 27in 6858mm on the south coast of the island near the location of Deans landfall A majority of rainfall was reported on the west side of Dean but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm High winds were reported on the eastern side of the storm however with lighter winds along the western quadrants of Dean Offshore waves up to 26ft 792m were reported and Sable Island reported rainfall of 059in 15mm Although there were no reports of damage in Atlantic Canada from Hurricane Dean three sailors had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard when their boat got dismasted during the storm

The Quang khem slowrunning deer or Chinhs deer is an animal resembling a deer found in the Pu Mat region of Vietnam close to V Quang It first came to scientific attention through the work of biologist Nguyen Ngoc Chinh

It is curious for its antlers which unlike those of other deer are unpronged in fact resembling the curled horns of an antelope Quang khem skulls culled by Nguyen have been sent to University of Copenhagen where they are being studied by Peter Arctander who has so far been unable to relate them to any known deer species As a result its taxonomic status remains undefined and no binomial name has been assigned yet

Equity Insurance Group
ERS is a specialist motor insurer It has been providing insurance products for more than 70 years and now provides cover solely via Lloyds Syndicate 218 ERS offers a diverse range of products including private car classic car van motorcycle taxi minibus fleet haulage agricultural vehicle and motor breakdown

ERS began life in 1946 as Equity Motor Policies a Lloyds syndicate In 1987 the company merged with Red Star to form Equity Red Star Nine years later the company was bought by Cox Insurance a Lloyds underwriting business specialising in nuclear marine and catastrophe insurance

In 2002 following losses incurred due to 911 Cox Insurance withdrew from its commercial insurance activity to focus on personal lines The business raised new equity capital to support its motor underwriting operation 

A management buyout of the business in 2005 led to a new focus and a new name Equity Insurance Group  led by CEO Neil Utley  backed by investors Englefield and Duke Street Capital It was headquartered at BrentwoodEssex Further facilities are located in Colchester and Swansea The groups high street broking network was rebranded converging Bennetts Insureshop and JMW to become Equity Insurance Brokers

On 4 December 2006 Australian insurer Insurance Australia Group announced that it would acquire Equity Insurance Group for 570million and Open  Direct Insurance Services the largest retail broking operation in Northern Ireland The acquisition was completed on 8 January 2007 and Neil Utley then CEO joined the executive team of IAG IAG also acquired Barnett  Barnett in 2008 and went on to dispose of its branchbased broking in 2009

In May 2012 IAG announced a strategic review of its UK operations selling Barnett  Barnett and the NBJ Broking arm In April 2013 US Private Equity company Aquiline purchased Equity Insurance Group from IAG for 80million This prompted a transformation programme which led to the sale of EDBL and its personal accident and household books to Canopius In April 2014 Equity Insurance Group rebranded to ERS and became a motor only broker only insurer It now operates solely as an A rated Lloyds syndicate 2181

In 2014 ERS underwent structural changes to drive further organisational efficiencies and implement steps to help the company achieve its goal of a 90 combined operational ratio This involved consolidating ERS offices into two locations London and Swansea and expanding both locations for growth As a result the Brentwood head office was closed with the majority of work that had been undertaken there split between London and Swansea However servicing for ERS direct classic car arm RH Insurance remains in Brentwood at an alternative site

ERS announced a full calendar year profit of 83m the first it has reported since 2009 and a 28m improvement year on year The combined ratio improved by 66 to 101 from the prior year with improvements across all ratios but the majority of improvement coming from the loss ratio Gross written premiums 388m down from 406m

ERS has approved the closure of its 2012 year of account with a small profit 14m 03 of capacity This is the first year of account since 2007 to close with a profit and is an improvement on the forecast provided last year which was for a small loss of 11m or 02 of capacity The forecast released for the 2013 year of account remains a small loss of 09 of capacity with a forecast of 59 to 41 This is an improvement on the forecast at the same point last year which was 73 to 27 and also an improvement on the Q3 2014 forecast

The calendar year profit for 2015 was 60m and the combined ratio improved to 998 2014 101 and is below 100 for the first time since 2009 with improvements across all ratios but the majority of improvement coming from the loss ratio Gross written premiums 394m an increase of 2 from 2014

ERS has approved the closure of its 2013 year of account with a profit 107m 24 of capacity this is an improvement from a year ago which forecast 2013 as a small loss of 09 of capacity and a range of 59 to 41 The current forecast released for the 2014 year of account remains a loss of 34 of capacity with a forecast of 84 to 16

ERS has received the following national awards

Kryptopterus geminus
Kryptopterus geminus is a species of catfish belonging to the family Siluridae It can be distinguished from all its congeners with the exception of Kryptopterus cryptopterus by the almost flat dorsal profile with no concavity behind the head This species grows to a length of SL

Examples of this distinctively shaped translucent fish used to be assigned to the longestablished species K cryptopterus but recent studies have shown several small but consistent differences which prompted the erection of this new species It has been recorded in Cambodia Laos Thailand and Vietnam K geminus can be distinguished from this close relative by its narrower head longer snout longer anal fin and eyes located much more laterally

Prlwytzkofsky
Prlwytzkofsky is a fictional written variant of the Dutch language based on the idiolect of the PolishGerman Professor Zbigniew Prlwytzkofsky sometimes spelled Prlwytzkofski as featured in the Tom Puss Tom Poes in Dutch and Oliver B Bumble Olivier B Bommel in Dutch series by Marten Toonder

The Professor uses several wellknown catchphrases

The language is characterised by an abundance of composite words built on the combination of words literally translated from German but in a small number of cases including a Slavic word Often the particular combination in Dutch may create a hint or an echo of a totally unconnected word For instance mislinger loserfailure a person combines the Dutch word mis miss  wrong failure with the German word gelingen succeed creating a word which hints at slinger pendulum or festoon The actual Dutch word is mislukkeling Professor Prlwytzkofsky calls disturbed brains verhoornde hersenschors  horned cerebral cortex Verhoornd horned rhymes with verstoord disturbed which is the meaning here but actually translates the German word for brain which is Gehirn Without knowledge of the German word one may be led to think that the phrase refers to the brains of a cuckold

A Slavic influence is obvious in Prlwytzkofsky calling his assistant Alexander Pieps a mouse Irkoetsk shortstatured assistant who always manages to do things in the wrong way but of course also referring to the Siberian town

Clearest examples of Germanization are

but since all words not of the female sex but ending in a consonant or diphthong take Der as their article this also hides a Slavic substratum and simplifies the Prlwytzkofsky gender system compared to Dutch and German

Magnetic domain
A magnetic domain is a region within a magnetic material in which the magnetization is in a uniform direction This means that the individual magnetic moments of the atoms are aligned with one another and they point in the same direction When cooled below a temperature called the Curie temperature the magnetization of a piece of ferromagnetic material spontaneously divides into many small regions called magnetic domains The magnetization within each domain points in a uniform direction but the magnetization of different domains may point in different directions Magnetic domain structure is responsible for the magnetic behavior of ferromagnetic materials like iron nickel cobalt and their alloys and ferrimagnetic materials like ferrite This includes the formation of permanent magnets and the attraction of ferromagnetic materials to a magnetic field The regions separating magnetic domains are called domain walls where the magnetization rotates coherently from the direction in one domain to that in the next domain The study of magnetic domains is called micromagnetics

Magnetic domains form in materials which have magnetic ordering that is their dipoles spontaneously align due to the exchange interaction These are the ferromagnetic ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials Paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials in which the dipoles align in response to an external field but do not spontaneously align do not have magnetic domains

Magnetic domain theory was developed by French physicist PierreErnest Weiss who in 1906 suggested existence of magnetic domains in ferromagnets He suggested that large number of atomic magnetic moments typically 1010 were aligned parallel The direction of alignment varies from domain to domain in a more or less random manner although certain crystallographic axis may be preferred by the magnetic moments called easy axes Weiss still had to explain the reason for the spontaneous alignment of atomic moments within a ferromagnetic material and he came up with the socalled Weiss mean field He assumed that a given magnetic moment in a material experienced a very high effective magnetic field due to the magnetization of its neighbors In the original Weiss theory the mean field was proportional to the bulk magnetization M so that

formula1

where formula2 is the mean field constant However this is not applicable to ferromagnets due to the variation of magnetization from domain to domain In this case the interaction field is

formula3

Where formula4 is the saturation magnetization at 0K

Later the quantum theory made it possible to understand the microscopic origin of the Weiss field The exchange interaction between localized spins favored a parallel in ferromagnets or an antiparallel in antiferromagnets state of neighboring magnetic moments

The reason a piece of magnetic material such as iron spontaneously divides into separate domains rather than exist in a state with magnetization in the same direction throughout the material is to minimize its internal energy A large region of ferromagnetic material with a constant magnetization throughout will create a large magnetic field extending into the space outside itself diagram a right This requires a lot of magnetostatic energy stored in the field To reduce this energy the sample can split into two domains with the magnetization in opposite directions in each domain diagram b right The magnetic field lines pass in loops in opposite directions through each domain reducing the field outside the material To reduce the field energy further each of these domains can split also resulting in smaller parallel domains with magnetization in alternating directions with smaller amounts of field outside the material

The domain structure of actual magnetic materials does not usually form by the process of large domains splitting into smaller ones as described here When a sample is cooled below the Curie temperature for example the equilibrium domain configuration simply appears But domains can split and the description of domains splitting is often used to reveal the energy tradeoffs in domain formation

As explained above a domain which is too big is unstable and will divide into smaller domains But a small enough domain will be stable and will not split and this determines the size of the domains created in a material This size depends on the balance of several energies within the material Each time a region of magnetization splits into two domains it creates a domain wall between the domains where magnetic dipoles molecules with magnetization pointing in different directions are adjacent The exchange interaction which creates the magnetization is a force which tends to align nearby dipoles so they point in the same direction Forcing adjacent dipoles to point in different directions requires energy Therefore a domain wall requires extra energy called the domain wall energy which is proportional to the area of the wall

Thus the net amount that the energy is reduced when a domain splits is equal to the difference between the magnetic field energy saved and the additional energy required to create the domain wall The field energy is proportional to the cube of the domain size while the domain wall energy is proportional to the square of the domain size So as the domains get smaller the net energy saved by splitting decreases The domains keep dividing into smaller domains until the energy cost of creating an additional domain wall is just equal to the field energy saved Then the domains of this size are stable In most materials the domains are microscopic in size around 10  10 m 

An additional way for the material to further reduce its magnetostatic energy is to form domains with magnetization at right angles to the other domains diagram c right instead of just in opposing parallel directions These domains called flux closure domains allow the field lines to turn 180 within the material forming closed loops entirely within the material reducing the magnetostatic energy to zero However forming these domains incurs two additional energy costs First the crystal lattice of most magnetic materials has magnetic anisotropy which means it has an easy direction of magnetization parallel to one of the crystal axes Changing the magnetization of the material to any other direction takes additional energy called the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy

The other energy cost to creating domains with magnetization at an angle to the easy direction is caused by the phenomenon called magnetostriction When the magnetization of a piece of magnetic material is changed to a different direction it causes a slight change in its shape The change in magnetic field causes the magnetic dipole molecules to change shape slightly making the crystal lattice longer in one dimension and shorter in other dimensions However since the magnetic domain is squished in with its boundaries held rigid by the surrounding material it cannot actually change shape So instead changing the direction of the magnetization induces tiny mechanical stresses in the material requiring more energy to create the domain This is called magnetoelastic anisotropy energy

To form these closure domains with sideways magnetization requires additional energy due to the aforementioned two factors So flux closure domains will only form where the magnetostatic energy saved is greater than the sum of the exchange energy to create the domain wall the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy and the magnetoelastic anisotropy energy Therefore most of the volume of the material is occupied by domains with magnetization either up or down along the easy direction and the flux closure domains only form in small areas at the edges of the other domains where they are needed to provide a path for magnetic field lines to change direction diagram c above

The above describes magnetic domain structure in a perfect crystal lattice such as would be found in a single crystal of iron However most magnetic materials are polycrystalline composed of microscopic crystalline grains These grains are not the same as domains Each grain is a little crystal with the crystal lattices of separate grains oriented in random directions In most materials each grain is big enough to contain several domains Each crystal has an easy axis of magnetization and is divided into domains with the axis of magnetization parallel to this axis in alternate directions

It can be seen that although on a microscopic scale almost all the magnetic dipoles in a piece of ferromagnetic material are lined up parallel to their neighbors in domains creating strong local magnetic fields energy minimization results in a domain structure that minimizes the largescale magnetic field The magnetization of neighboring domains point in different directions confining the field lines to microscopic loops between neighboring domains within the material so the combined fields cancel at a distance Therefore a bulk piece of ferromagnetic material in its lowest energy state has little or no external magnetic field The material is said to be unmagnetized

However the domains can also exist in other configurations in which their magnetization mostly points in the same direction creating an external magnetic field Although these are not minimum energy configurations due to a phenomenon where the domain walls become pinned to defects in the crystal lattice they can be local minimums of the energy and therefore can be very stable Applying an external magnetic field to the material can make the domain walls move causing the domains aligned with the field to grow and the opposing domains to shrink When the external field is removed the domain walls remain pinned in their new orientation and the aligned domains produce a magnetic field This is what happens when a piece of ferromagnetic material is magnetized and becomes a permanent magnet

Heating a magnet subjecting it to vibration by hammering it or applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field from a degaussing coil tends to pull the domain walls free from their pinned states and they will return to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field thus demagnetizing the material

The contributions of the different internal energy factors described above is expressed by the free energy equation proposed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz in 1935 which forms the basis of the modern theory of magnetic domains The domain structure of a material is the one which minimizes the Gibbs free energy of the material For a crystal of magnetic material this is the LandauLifshitz free energy E which is the sum of these energy terms

where

Some sources define a wall energy E equal to the sum of the exchange energy and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy which replaces E and E in the above equation

A stable domain structure is a magnetization function Mx considered as a continuous vector field which minimizes the total energy E throughout the material To find the minimums a variational method is used resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations called Browns equations after William Fuller Brown Jr Although in principle these equations can be solved for the stable domain configurations Mx in practice only the simplest examples can be solved Analytic solutions do not exist and numerical solutions calculated by the finite element method are computationally intractable because of the large difference in scale between the domain size and the wall size Therefore micromagnetics has evolved approximate methods which assume that the magnetization of dipoles in the bulk of the domain away from the wall all point in the same direction and numerical solutions are only used near the domain wall where the magnetization is changing rapidly

There are a number of microscopy methods that can be used to visualize the magnetization at the surface of a magnetic material revealing the magnetic domains Each method has a different application because not all domains are the same In magnetic materials domains can be circular square irregular elongated and striped all of which have varied sizes and dimensions

Large domains within the range of 25100 micrometers can be easily seen by Kerr microscopy which uses the magnetooptic Kerr effect which is the rotation of the polarization of light reflected from a magnetized surface

Lorentz microscopy is a transmission electron microscopy technique used to study magnetic domain structures at very high resolution Offaxis electron holography is a related technique used to observe magnetic structures by detecting nanoscale magnetic fields

Another technique for viewing submicroscopic domain structures down to a scale of a few nanometers is magnetic force microscopy MFM is a form of atomic force microscopy that uses a magnetically coated probe tip to scan the sample surface

Bitter patterns are a technique for imaging magnetic domains that were first observed by Francis Bitter The technique involves placing a small quantity of ferrofluid on the surface of a ferromagnetic material The ferrofluid arranges itself along magnetic domain walls which have higher magnetic flux than the regions of the material located within domains
A modified Bitter technique has been incorporated into a widely used device the Large Area Domain Viewer which is particularly useful in the examination of grainoriented silicon steels

Stenhouse Bay South Australia
Stenhouse Bay is a place in the Australian state of South Australia near the southwest extremity of the Yorke Peninsula located in the gazetted locality of Inneston about west of the state capital of Adelaide 

Stenhouse Bay was named after Andrew Stenhouse who was a principal of the Permasite Manufacturing Co Pty Ltd which held leases for the harvesting of gypsum north of Cape Spencer

Since 1999 it has been located within the locality of Inneston
Its official status as of 2013 is that of a locality unbounded which is listed on the South Australian place name gazetteer with the advice that it is not to be used as an address 

The Waratah Gypsum Company had works here for the quarrying and exporting of rock gypsum Gypsum after being washed roasted and ground was used in the manufacturing of plaster of paris and cement The quality of the gypsum in this area was exceptionally high class and most of Australias needs were supplied from here

The Waratah Gypsum Company closed its works and the town was sold to the South Australian Government which demolished the town except for the few houses required for the rangers of the National Parks and Wildlife Organization who look after Innes National Park

Stenhouse Bay has been the site of an automatic weather station since 20 November 1995

After almost 60 years the shop at Stenhouse Bay trading in recent years as Innes Park Trading Post and Rhinos Tavern was demolished before Christmas in 2013 

The iconic trading post and tavern was closed and fenced off just before the peak Christmas period Park visitors must now travel 5km out of the park back to Marion Bay for fuel camping goods and a restaurant meal The closure meant the department lost between 30000 and 50000 in annual lease revenue

In 1921 Camp Midvale was founded as a haven for working people seeking refuge recreation community and nature by a group of outdoor enthusiasts called the Nature Friends Naturfreunde In 1935 Nature Friends volunteers carved the present swimming pool out of the hillside by hand 

In 1974 the Metropolitan Recreation Association a successor group of the Nature Friends donated the Camp Midvale property to the Ethical Culture Society because they were unable to financially maintain it and most of the wooded area of over was placed under the New Jersey Green Acres program to be preserved from development in perpetuity 

Ethical Culture members Walter and May Weis endowed money to the remaining developed part of the property in order to realize their dream of preserving land for the purpose of environmental education Thus the Weis Ecology Center WEC a private nonprofit organization was created to offer the public a unique opportunity to learn about the Northern New Jersey Highlands Region 

The WEC was then taken over by the New Jersey Audubon Society who closed the pool in 1994 

In 1995 New Jersey Audubon agreed to allow the community to open the pool and in 1996 The Community Association of the Highlands incorporated reopening the site as the Highlands Natural Pool In 1998 NJASWEC formally donated the pool to the community

Hawala scandal
The Hawala scandal also called the Jain Diaries case or the hawala scam was an Indian political and financial scandal involving payments allegedly sent by politicians black money through four hawala brokers namely the Jain brothers It was a US18 million bribery scandal that implicated some of the countrys leading politicians It also led to a fixed tenure of minimum 2 years for CBI Directors to prevent politicians from interfering with the Directors duties

In 1991 an arrest linked to militants in Kashmir led to a raid on hawala brokers revealing evidence of largescale payments to national politicians On 25 March 1991 as per the court proceedings published by the Supreme court of India Ashfak Hussain Lone a person alleged to be an official of the terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen was arrested in Delhi During his interrogation the police learnt that his organisation was funded through hawala using Surendra Kumar Jain and his family as a conduit Based on this and further information received during Lones interrogation the Central Bureau of Investigation CBI conducted raids on the premises of Surrender Kumar Jain his brothers relations and businesses During the raids the CBI seized Indian and foreign currency two diaries and two note books at the premises These diaries contained detailed accounts of vast payments made to people identified only by initials The initials corresponded to the initials of high ranking politicians both in power and out of power and of high ranking bureaucrats At this stage the investigation stopped at the CBI and neither the Jains nor the contents of their diaries were investigated by the CBI Meanwhile officers of the CBI involved in the investigation were transferred out to other places by orders from ruling politicians However the case continued to make headlines in the newspapers media as it was pursued by a few journalists

On 4 October 1993 writ petitions were filed at the Supreme court of India in the public interest under Article 32 of the Constitution of the India These contained allegations that Government agencies like the CBI and the revenue authorities had failed to perform their duties and legal obligations as they had failed to investigate matters arising out of the seizure of the Jan diaries that the apprehension of terrorists had led to the discovery of financial support to them by clandestine and illegal means using tainted funds obtained through havala transactions that this had also disclosed a nexus between politicians bureaucrats and criminals who were recipients of money from unlawful sources given for unlawful consideration that the CBI and other Government agencies had failed to investigate the matter take it to its logical conclusion and prosecute all persons who were found to have committed and offence that this was done with a view to protect the persons involved who were very influential and powerful that the matter disclosed a nexus between crime and corruption at high places in public life and it posed a serious threat to the integrity security and economy of the nation that probity in public life the rule of law and the preservation of democracy required that the Government agencies the compelled to duly perform their legal obligations and to proceed in accordance with law against every person involved irrespective of where he was placed in the political hierarchy In India the Havala method is an illegal method of transacting in foreign currency It is illegal and contentious due to two reasons Firstly it is highly secretive as it does not reveal the identity of people on either side of the transaction even to the havala operators Secondly it violates the FERA regulations of India as it does not use approved channels of regular banks for foreign currency transactions However it is often used in India for two reasons Firstly to transfer legally earned salaries example  by ordinary workers overseas in Saudi Arabia and UAE to their hometowns as hawala transaction costs are a fraction of banks and havala operators can be found in the smallest villages of India Secondly by politicians bureaucrats and nefarious elements to transfer corruption money

Those accused included L K Advani V C Shukla P Shiv Shankar Sharad Yadav Balram Jakhar and Madan Lal Khurana The entire list contained politicians from the BJP Congress and independent MLAs and MPs with amounts varying between Rs 50000 to Rs 75 crore The prosecution that followed was partly prompted by a public interest petition see Vineet Narain and yet the court cases of the Hawala scandal eventually all collapsed without convictions Many were acquitted in 1997 and 1998 partly because the hawala records including diaries were judged in court to be inadequate as the main evidence The Central Bureau of Investigations role was criticised In concluding the Vineet Narain case the Supreme Court of India directed that the Central Vigilance Commission should be given a supervisory role over the CBI

The supreme court proceeding did not relate to the hawala case per se but rather to the suspicious transfer of the CBI Director Joginder Singh and the rampant misuse of political power to curb the investigations of the CBI and Revenue department In its judgment delivered on 18 December 1997 the court through judges SPBharucha and SCSen gave a ruling consisting of a 26 points list of pronouncements the most important of which made it impossible for politicians in the government to remove the Director of the CBI for 2 years thus ensuring that the CBI and its officers would have freedom to carry out their work without political interference

The Jain Hawala story was broken by two Delhibased journalists Ram Bahadur Rai and Rajesh Joshi working for the Hindi daily Jansatta Then Vineet Narain the journalist filed a public interest litigation in the Supreme court of India

Atan Burhagohain
Atan Burhagohain Assamese    was one of the most influential Burhagohains in the nearly 600 years of the Ahom kingdom Atan Burhagohain Rajmantri Dangaria was the Prime Minister of Assam for more than seventeen years from January 1662 to March 1679 During this period Assam passed through a series of crises in the form of foreign invasions and internal disruptions and Atan Burhagohain conducted the affairs with rare foresight probity judgment and patriotism The versatile qualities of the Burhagoain and the proof that he gave of his lofty and noble ideals made him the darling of the people Kings potentates and the populace were united in showering tokens of their admiration and respect on this man of their countrys destiny Twice the crown was offered to him which he did twice refuse saying It does not behove a minister to become a monarch kingship should go to the scion of a royal family and saintship to the descendant of a saint

He was appointed as the Prime Minister in January 1662 at the time Garhgaon was occupied by Mir Jumla He oversaw the military resistance to the Mughal general negotiated the Treaty of Ghilajharighat planned the rejuvenation of the Ahom kingdom and was one of the architects of the Ahom victory at the Battle of Saraighat He was known for his military tactics of guerrilla warfare that came to be known as daga juddha and also for his statesmanship and wise counsel He was appointed the Rajmantri Dangaria Prime Minister by the Ahom king Chakradhwaj Singha and in the turmoil following the excesses of Debera Borbarua he was offered the Ahom throne itself which he refused Despite his wisdom and keen political sense he was unable to see through the treachery of Laluk Sola Borphukan and was murdered by the Borphukans henchmen in 1679

According to the Buranjis the Burhagohain was tall in stature and his strides resembled that of a goose His face was broad and he had two moles on the forehead He was ruddy in complexion He wore a buffalocoloured gati or a cloth tightly wrapped round the body with two ends made into a knot near the waist and he carried a big hengdang or sword Since he belonged to the Bahgaria clan he is generally referred to as Bahgaria Atan Burhagohain

Atan Burhagohain was one of the key people in the victory of the Assamese in the Battle of Saraighat The Prime Minister was personally in charge of the command of the northern division of the Ahom army on the north bank of Guwahati His camp was situated at Lathia Parvat and he had with him 80 chorbachas or commando soldiers in his Pali meaning a unit of command under a commander in Assamese

From his base at Lathia fort he initiated a campaign of guerrilla attacks on the Mughals employing many well known commandos Lai Lechai Chili Mabi Mari Achor Tunai Baduli and other spies who entered the enemys camps at night and removed their treasures money and disabled their arms

Atan Burhagohain was also a highly skilled military engineer and after the occupation of Gauhati he was directed by the King to oversee the construction of the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra Before the final Saraighat battle on seeing the fortification and preparation of the Ahom army Raja Ram Singha commented to his lieutenant Rashid Khan
This conversation was communicated to the Ahoms by a traveller named Hangalbhanga Laskar On hearing this the Premier Atan Burhagohain promulgated this message to the army

Atan Burhagohain was not only a highly trained soldier he was also an able administrator and astute statesman Immediately upon ascending the throne King Chakradhwaj Singha was impatient and contemplated immediate attack on the Mughal forces He pleaded with the King that such attack would be suicidal that first they should properly train the army build the armory stock food provisions and other war material as the hostilities may continue for a number of years He addressed the king and his councillors on this occasion

He said sakalo dravyat thaki chaul kotha he prodhan rice is the most indispensable and important of all the items Long before Napoleon stated that an Army marches on its stomach Atan Burhagohain had realised this and convinced his king to make necessary preparations

Atan Burhagohain further pleaded

Atan Burhagohain also advised to have the boatsmen and oarsmen trained
The counsel of Prime Minister Atan Burhagohain roused the monarch to a consciousness of the realities of the situation and extensive preparation was made for two years before the onslaught on the Mughals

After the reoccupation of Gauhati by the Ahoms Atan Burhagohain was appointed by the king to erect the necessary fortifications on both banks of Brahmaputra strengthen them stock them with provisions and men Lachit Borphukan was asked to post a contingent of soldiers at each strategic point under an able commander Under the Premiers supervision the civil administration of Kamrup was reorganised on sound footing and Chaudhuris and Patwaries were appointed to realise the stipulated jaigiridhan or land revenue The administration of the parganas of Kamrup was vested under various senior officers Barphukan Darang Barbhag and Bangeswar Paniphukan Khata and Banbhag Duara Phukan Pubpar and Paschimpar Deka Phukan Sarubangsar and Kacharimahal Chetia Phukan Ramsa and Sarukhetri Dayangia Rajkhowa Bar Khetri TarSalagarua Rajkhowa Barhanti Dikhowmukhia Rajkhowa Chamaria PaniSalaguria Rajkhowa Nagarberha PaniDihingia Rajkhowa Bagaribari TaruaDihingia Rajkhowa Barpeta Namdangia Rajkhowa Barnagar PaniAbhoypuria Rajkhowa Bajali BarAbhoypuria Rajkhowa Bekeli and SaruAbhoypuria Rajkhowa Bausi

During the war Raja Ram Singha asked his envoy Panditrai
To this Panditrai replied
Ram Singha commented It is really wonderful that a man can be so intelligent at this tender age Panditrai added The Burhagohain is also an archdiplomat Ram Singha concluded Who will be able to cope with such a minister when he comes to years Pride should be the heritage of that land where such a counsellor has taken his birth

Earl Fitzwilliams private railway
Earl Fitzwilliams private railway near Rotherham South Yorkshire was constructed in order to link the Earls coal interests to the southeast of his Wentworth estate with the Greasbrough Canal also owned by his estate which gave an outlet to the River Dun Don Navigation 

This was not the first connection between the coal pits at that time owned by the Marquess of Rockingham and the canal for in the middle years of the 18th century a wagonway had been built to link the Bassingthorpe pits to the newly opened Rotherham Cut of the River Dun Navigation The Greasbrough Canal connecting to the navigation on the boundaries of Rotherham and Parkgate was opened in 1780 to serve the Marquesss interests and the wagonways from his coal pits at Bassingthorpe were diverted to the canal head Two years later the Marquess died and the estate passed to his nephew Earl Fitzwilliam

The Earl owned coal pits at High Stubbin and Swallow Wood and these pits were from the early 19th century joined by a wagonway to the Greasbrough Canal In 1839 the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway opened a branch from its main line at Holmes which had been opened the previous year to join with the Earls railway at Parkgate This line ran alongside the construction works of the North Midland Railway before joining the canal bank This connection broke the near monopoly of the Duke of Norfolks estate in supplying coal to the developing industries of the city and gave the Earls coal a competitive edge in the marketplace 

In 1840 the estate bought a sixcoupled steam locomotive for use on the line and to accommodate this the wagonway was rebuilt

A connection was made from the North Midland Railway to the Earls line which rendered the branch from Holmes redundant This connection was closed in 1977 a year before New Stubbin Colliery itself The Manchester Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway constructed a line from Rotherham Road alongside the canal and below the North Midland line to reach the canal head The line opened in 1873 and the agreement between the Earls Colliery Company and the MS L terminated on 31 December 1978 when the line closed 

In 1915 Viscount Halifax invested heavily into improvement of the rail line

The line can be divided into two sections both originally ropeworked The lower section serving New Stubbin Colliery sunk between 1913 and 1915 changed to locomotive working

Its last steam locomotives were two examples built by Hudswell Clarke  Co of Leeds No 34 an outside cylinder sixcoupled side tank locomotive works No1523 built in 1925 and delivered new to the ApplebyFrodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe which came to the line in the 1950s and No 37 an outside cylinder sixcoupled saddle tank They worked until the mid1960s when the line became fully dieselised Hudswell Clarke again supplying the power

Trouble Cat Stevens song
Trouble is a song written by the English singersongwriter and musician Cat Stevens during a period from 1969 to 1970 

Stevens was recovering during what amounted to nearly a year of convalescence after being diagnosed with a collapsed lung and tuberculosis He spent three months in King Edward VII Hospital Midhurst England transferring afterward to another nine months of bedrest at home Stevens who was near death at the time he was admitted in the hospital used the time he was recuperating for contemplation and wrote dozens of songs including Trouble many of which were recorded much later 

When he was hospitalized Stevens was often alone in a very spare and plain room He was told that at the time he was admitted he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him The effect on the 19yearold pop star was pronounced He said To go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital getting injections day in and day out and people around you are dying it certainly changes your perspective I got down to thinking about myself It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folkrock emphasis

While recovering Stevens donated his spare time and some of his newer more introspective songs for Colin Higgins and Hal Ashbys 1971 film soundtrack of Harold and Maude Most of the tunes used for the movie appear on Stevenss next albums Mona Bone Jakon and Tea for the Tillerman with the exception of two songs which were not released until the release of the album  in 1984 If You Want to Sing Out Sing Out and Dont Be Shy

In Harold and Maude the song Trouble is used in the scene of Maudes impending death with her devoted young lover heartbroken over the turn of events

Dinny Meehan
Dennis L Meehan June 5 1889  March 31 1920 was the leader of the White Hand Gang in the 1910s Dinny Meehan was described by the police as the most desperate gang leader in Brooklyn 

Born in Brooklyn Meehan apparently joined the White Hand Gang in his late teens In 1912 he was arrested for shooting and killing Chris Maroney who led a faction of White Handers from the Navy Yard section of Brooklyn After a sensational trial Meehan was acquitted adding to his criminal reputation Over the years he had served time in the Elmira Reformatory Blackwells Island and the City Workhouse Dinny often boasted that he would never see the inside of a state penitentiary 

Unlike some crime bosses Dinny Meehan often joined his men on criminal jobs By 1920 there were a total of three cases pending against him he was out of jail on a 5000 bond for robbing a man on Fifth Avenue leading his men in the hijacking of a truckload of shoes worth 10000 and overseeing the theft of 10000 worth of silk from a Red Hook warehouse

On the afternoon of March 31 1920 Dinny Meehan and his wife Sadie were asleep in bed at their apartment at 452 Warren Street in Red Hook Their fouryearold son played in the living room while Sadies mother Rose Leighton dozed in a recliner Neither of them knew that five strange men were in the apartment until the last second As the men made for the bedroom the young boy admonished them not to wake his parents The leader of the group playfully patted the youngsters head and said they just wanted to look in A total of five shots were fired one passed through Dinny Meehans head and then lodged in the shoulder of his wife who later recovered from her wounds The gunmen dashed from the building and made their escape in an automobile truck 

Meehans murder has been traditionally thought to have been arranged by Brooklyn Black Hand boss Frankie Yale and carried out by Yales underboss Augie Pisano and two hitmen from Cleveland Ralph DeSarno and Giovanni Sciacca At the time of the killing however police believed that a possible motive was the gang leaders role in supplying strikebreakers to take the places of employees of the United Fruit Company on piers along the Hudson and East Rivers These employees had recently walked out when their demands for higher wages were turned down The arrest of a Frank Madden an associate of the International Longshoremens Association Local 856 and his subsequent plea of Not Guilty for the charge of Meehans murder confirms this It was also rumored that there was internal strife in the White Hand Gang Just before his murder Meehan was acquitted in a robbery case while one of his henchman Edward Gilchrist was convicted Dinny was said to have doublecrossed Gilchrist causing resentment within his gang Sadie Meehan told police in November 1923 that her husbands killer was in fact Wild Bill Lovett head of the archrival Jay Street Gang Meehans murder has remained officially unsolved

The Sisu fair held in late Februaryearly march and the festival of Baisakhi are important events at Rewalsar

Mandarava and Padmasambhava were energetically drawn to one another Vihardhara fearful of the contamination of the royal bloodline and what he perceived as Mandaravas apostasy endeavoured to have Mandarava and Padmasambhava purified by immolation through the flames of a pyre Instead of finding their corpses incensed and charred Vihardhara finds that the fire of the pyre has been transformed into Lake Rewalsar out of which arises a blooming lotus that supports the unharmed Mandarava and Padmasambhava who through this manifestation of their realisation have achieved their secret names of Vajravarahi and Hayagriva respectively after which Vihardhara furnishes the union with his unreserved blessings

Legend has it that the great teacher Padmasambhava Guru Rinpoche used his enormous power to take flight to Tibet from Rewalsar In Rewalsar his spirit is said to reside in the tiny island of floating reed that drifts over the water

On April 1 2012 a monumental statue of Padmasambhava measuring 375 m 123 ft was consecrated blessed and inaugurated by the 14th Dalai Lama The building project was spearheaded and overseen by Wangdor Rinpoche and funded by donations It took nearly 10 years to complete with the foundation alone taking three years 

The statue was constructed almost entirely by hand by tradespeople from the immediate Rewalsar area and by master artists from Nepal and Bhutan It is made primarily of cement layered by hand over a skeleton of iron rebar while the walls are made of handcut stone Bhutanese sculptors carved intricate details into the cement while still wet It was then painted by masters from Nepal who finished the delicate details by hand The buildings interior is filled with traditional dzong tsa tsas prayer flags and medicine pills made by local craftworkers

Chlamydogobius
Chlamydogobius is a genus of gobies from Australia All but one coastal species C ranunculus are found in inland waters such as springs pools creeks and streams

Most species live in extreme environments for example several species of Chlamydogobius are found in the water that emerges from geothermal springs such as the Dalhousie goby found in the waters around Dalhousie Springs

These fish can live in water with a wide range of temperatures pH salinity and oxygen levels for example they are found in water with a pH between 68 and 90 and temperatures between  They can tolerate salinity as high as 60 parts per thousand almost twice that of sea water They have been found in water with extremely low oxygen levels as low as 08 ppm Their water habitats often exhibit oxygen levels below 5 milligrams of oxygen per litre

To cope with extremely low oxygen levels they will emerge from the water to gulp air known as aerial respiration They also will position themselves over beds of algae to capture the produced oxygen

They will hide in the mud and silt at the bottom of a stream or in a plant or under a rock to avoid more extreme water temperatures Sometimes they will emerge from very hot water for brief periods to take advantage of evaporative cooling
They can survive even if there are drought conditions that reduce the size of their habitat If there is a flood that results in drastically increased water flow they anchor themselves to rocks with their pelvic fins

Chlamydogobius fish are able to change their colours to blend in with their environments

Human drilling activities in Australia have often reduced the pressure of the aquifers that feed the Australian hot springs that Chlamydogobius rely on so some species are endangered

There are currently six recognized species in this genus

Trisbuffered saline
Trisbuffered saline abbreviated TBS is a buffer used in some biochemical techniques to maintain the pH within a relatively narrow range Tris with HCl has a slightly alkaline buffering capacity in the 792 range The conjugate acid of Tris has a pK of 807 at 25C The pK declines approximately 003 units per degree Celsius rise in temperature This can lead to relatively dramatic pH shifts when there are shifts in solution temperature Sodium chloride concentration may vary from 100200 mM tris concentration from 5100 mM and pH from 7280 A common formulation of TBS is 150 mM NaCl 50 mM TrisHCl pH 76 TBS can also be prepared by using commercially made TBS buffer tablets or pouches

TBS has many uses because it is isotonic and nontoxic It can be used to dilute substances used in laboratory experiments Additives can be used to add to a compounds functionality

TBS is often used in immunoblotting for both membrane washing and antibody dilution

American game show winnings records
In the United States a game show is a type of radio television or internet program in which contestants television personalities or celebrities sometimes as part of a team play a game which involves answering trivia questions andor solving puzzles usually for money andor prizes Game shows are usually distinguishable from reality television competition shows in which the competition consumes an entire season of episodes in a game show prizes can typically be won in a single match in some cases particularly in the ones that offer recordsetting prizes contestants can play multiple matches and accumulate a larger total

Since the genre began many shows have offered prizes of large sums of money to contestants Teddy Nadler set the original monetary winnings record of 264000 during his appearance on The 64000 Challenge in 1957 Nadler was not surpassed until 1980 when Thom McKee won 312700 on TicTacDough In 1999 John Carpenter won 1000000 on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire becoming the first person to win a sevenfigure prize on an American game show Since then many players have gone on to win that amount and even surpassed it As of 2019 Brad Rutter is the highestearning American game show contestant of all time having accumulated a total of 4888440 He succeeded Ken Jennings as the highestearning contestant by virtue of his victory on May 16 2014 in the Jeopardy Battle of the Decades tournament

Most daytime game show top prizes were limited to 25000 during the 1960s and 1970s a restriction made for both budgetary concerns and to assuage criticism that arose from the 1950s quiz show scandals The single day record for shows in daytime television was set by Michael Larson in 1984 who won 110237  on Press Your Luck Larson achieved his record by memorizing the shows board patterns He repeatedly hit the boards squares that awarded contestants money and an additional spin That spin would in turn replace the spin he had just used effectively allowing him to spin the board in the second round as long as wanted Because of this his game had to be split into two episodes which aired June 8 and June 11 1984 as his turn caused the game to go well over the shows halfhour allotted time At the time of the shows airing CBS only allowed contestants to win up to 50000 on a game show contestants would retire after winning 25000 the winnings limit increased to 75000 in November of that year and would increase to 100000 and later 125000 before being eliminated in 2006 In 2003 Game Show Network produced a documentary about the event

In 2006 Larson was succeeded by Vickyann ChrobakSadowski who set the record by winning 147517  on the 35th season premiere of The Price Is Right in 2006 ChrobakSadowskis record was later broken by Sheree Heil from her appearance on The Price Is Right in 2013 She won 170345 in cash and prizes on the episode that aired December 30 2013 including an Audi R8 won in the pricing game Gas Money 10000 cash and Prada shoes 

On the October 28 2016 episode of The Price Is Right which aired during Big Money Week Christen Freeman won 210000 in cash during a playing of Cliff Hangers During the episode game rules were modified to offer a top prize of 250000 which was reduced by 10000 for every step the mountain climber took In addition to her One Bid prize and an additional 1000 won during the Showcase Showdown Freemans grand total was 212879  setting a new daytime record

While the 1950s had multiple big winners Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren of Twenty One being two of the most notable Teddy Nadler set a record during the 195657 television season that would stand for the next two decades winning 264000  on The 64000 Challenge The quiz show scandals of 1958 and 1959 prompted the cancellation of most of the bigbudget game shows and the imposition of strict limits on prize amounts which meant that through the 1960s and 1970s game show contestants could not match their 1950s counterparts

It was not until 1980 that Nadlers record fell During the summer of that year a US Naval officer named Thom McKee began a run on TicTacDough that carried over into the following season Since champions on Tic Tac Dough played until they were defeated and games on the show could end in ties with the pot carrying over McKee was able to keep building his total as long as he kept playing and winning McKee won 312700  in cash and prizes in 43 games which included eight cars on Tic Tac Dough and its sister show The Jokers Wild a contestant automatically won a car after every fifth game they won

While McKee was the biggest solo winner until 1999 nine couples on The 1000000 Chance of a Lifetime won the shows top prize of 1000000  in a combination of prizes and a longterm annuity during the shows run in syndication from January 1986 to September 1987 However this program had no solo players

In 1999 McKee was passed by Michael Shutterly who was the biggest winner in the first season of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in the United States Shutterly was the first contestant on the show to get to the 15th and final question but elected to walk instead with 500000  which made him the biggest winner in American game show history at the time Shutterly had previously won 49200 as a 4 day champion on Jeopardy in 1988 making his career winnings total 549200 

During the second season of Millionaire in the United States the show crowned its first milliondollar winner On November 19 1999 John Carpenter won the shows top prize without using any lifelines save for a phone call on the final question to tell his father he was going to win the million dollars After Carpenter answered the final question which concerned Richard Nixons appearance on LaughIn in 1968 host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the shows and worldwide formats first top prize winner

Carpenters record remained intact until the following year In early 2000 Rahim Oberholtzer a contestant on the revival of Twenty One won four games in his appearances on the show along with 120000 in the shows Perfect 21 bonus round for a total of 1120000 For surpassing Carpenters mark host Maury Povich proclaimed Oberholtzer the TV Game Show King

Late in its run the Fox show Greed brought back some of its previous winners to try for an extra 1000000 Curtis Warren who was part of the first team to win 1000000 on the show of which his share was 400000 plus 10000 for winning a terminator round was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 11 2000 Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies with eight choices of which he had to identify the four correct answers He successfully did so giving himself 1410000  and the record for the time being

Warrens record was even shorter lived than Oberholtzers had been lasting only four days Three days before Warrens win David Legler who also appeared on NBCs Twenty One began a run as champion on the show Four days after Warrens win the run continued with Legler having earned a grand total of 1765000  in six wins to surpass Warrens record and become the third contestant in two months to top 1000000 on a game show

Legler held the record for well over a year outlasting Twenty One itself by July 2000 the milliondollar game show boom went bust and both Greed and Twenty One along with several others were canceled leaving only Millionaire By the start of 2001 the producers of Millionaire decided that it had been too long 71 episodes over a fivemonth period since their top prize had been won and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added 10000 to the grand prize amount for each episode it was not won Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10 2001 winning a jackpot of 2180000  Olmstead became the first contestant to top 2000000 in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the alltime leader

In 2004 ABC launched an ultra highstakes version of Millionaire entitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire with a 10000000 top prize Two separate Super Millionaire series aired one in February and one in May of that year However despite the higher stakes and the potential for someone to top the alltime record for winnings the largest prize awarded was 1000000  won by Robert Essig

One week after Super Millionaire came to an end Ken Jennings of Salt Lake City Utah became the new champion on Jeopardy The episode broadcast on June 2 2004 was the first in a long winning streak for the software engineer made possible due to a change at the beginning of that season the shows twentieth on air in syndication eliminating the longstanding rule limiting consecutive appearances for a champion to five With no limit to his appearances Jennings began to break many game show records As his streak continued deeper into the 21st season Jennings was inching closer and closer to Olmsteads record Jennings topped Olmsteads Millionaire winnings with his 65th consecutive win finishing the day with 45099 and a new cumulative total of 2197000

Jennings won nine more games before his streak came to an end on November 30 2004 He had extended his record total to 2520700 at the time of his defeat after which he was awarded an additional 2000 for finishing in second place per Jeopardy rules Shortly after Jennings defeat Jeopardy decided to see how he would fare in tournament play On February 9 2005 the show launched its Ultimate Tournament of Champions inviting back 144 other past champions to compete over the next three months in a fiveround singleelimination tournament with a 2000000 grand prize The field included the highestwinning fivetime champions and winners of some previous tournaments though not all invitees were able to participate Jennings received a bye into the finals of the tournament where he faced semifinal winners Jerome Vered and Brad Rutter in a threegame cumulative total match Vered had set a singleday scoring record during his appearance on the show in 1992 while Rutter had won the 2001 Tournament of Champions and the 2002 Million Dollar Masters tournament and was the shows highestearning contestant of alltime before Jennings

In the tournaments threeday final Rutter defeated Jennings and Vered to win the tournament and 2000000 and in the process he supplanted Jennings as the winningest all time American game show contestant Including the 118 million he had won in his previous Jeopardy appearances five regular season games a Tournament of Champions win the Million Dollar Masters win and three matches in the earlier rounds of the Ultimate Tournament of Champions Rutters total stood at 3255102 while Jennings was now second with 3022700 having gained an additional 500000 for his secondplace finish in the tournament

Jennings slowly began to chip away at Rutters record first by winning 71429 in 2006 as part of the Mob on NBCs 1 vs 100 A year later Jennings won the Grand Slam tournament on Game Show Network and the 100000 top prize by defeating Ogi Ogas in the final round Finally on October 10 2008 Jennings passed Rutter by winning 500000 on Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader He extended the record by winning 300000 in The IBM Challenge where he and Rutter took on IBM supercomputer Watson in a special 2011 Jeopardy event Rutter won 200000 in the challenge in which both he and Jennings pledged half of their winnings to charity He then added 100000 more later in 2011 when he appeared on Million Dollar Mind Game raising his total to 3555102 second only to Jennings 392341429

In 2014 Jennings and Rutter were both invited to play in the Jeopardy Battle of the Decades a tournament conducted by the producers of Jeopardy to celebrate its thirtieth season in syndication Both men advanced to the twoday tournament final with Roger Craig filling the third position Needing a win to reclaim his record Rutter took the top prize in the tournament after Jennings who needed to answer the second days Final Jeopardy clue correctly to win after making a sufficient wager failed to do so Rutter won the top prize of 1000000 while Jennings won the 100000 second prize

Jennings later appeared on Millionaire in November 2014 Winning the top prize was the only way he could have reclaimed the record from Rutter however Jennings finished with only 100000 leaving him in second place He was then a contestant on the ABC primetime show 500 Questions in 2016 however as he only lasted four questions he was unable to add to his total

Both Jennings and Rutter competed in the Jeopardy AllStar Games in 2019 Under the format of that tournament teams of three competed in a relay to win a 1000000 top prize split between them thus either Jennings or Rutter would be able to add up to 33333334 to their totals as captains of their respective teams if they won the total was not enough for Jennings to surpass Rutter Rutters team won the tournament with Jenningss team finishing in second and winning 300000 to split between them
A month after the AllStar Games came to an end James Holzhauer became the new champion on Jeopardy The episode which was broadcast on April 4 2019 was the first episode in what is an ongoing winning streak where he became the third contestant to win 1000000 or more in the shows history As of May 1 Holzhauer who also has 5833333 in winnings from his win on The Chase ranks eighth in earnings among all game shows Jeopardy has taped three months of additional episodes that have not yet been broadcast it finished taping for the season which runs through July in April and thus Holzhauer may have already won substantially more money than has publicly been reported

Rectus sheath
The rectus sheath also called the rectus fascia is formed by the aponeuroses of the transverse abdominal and the external and internal oblique muscles It contains the rectus abdominis and pyramidalis muscles

It can be divided into anterior and posterior laminae

The arrangement of the layers has important variations at different locations in the body

For context above the sheath are the following two layers


Within the sheath the layers vary

Below the sheath are the following three layers

The rectus in the situation where its sheath is deficient below is separated from the peritoneum only by the transversalis fascia in contrast to the upper layers where part of the internal oblique also runs beneath the rectus Because of the thinner layers below this region is more susceptible to herniation

Since the tendons of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis only reach as high as the costal margin it follows that above this level the sheath of the rectus is deficient behind the muscle resting directly on the cartilages of the ribs and being covered only by the tendons of the external obliques

Boduberu
Boduberu Dhivehi  is similar to some of the songs and dances found in east and south west Africa It is likely that the music was introduced to The Maldives by sailors from the Indian Ocean region It may be said that Boduberu first made an appearance in The Maldives in the 11th Century AD or possibly before that 
Boduberu is performed by about 20 people including three drummers and a lead singer They are accompanied by a small bell a set of drums also known as a bodu beru and an onugandu  a small piece of bamboo with horizontal grooves from which raspy sounds are produced by scraping The songs may be of heroism romance or satire The prelude to the song is a slow beat with emphasis on drumming and dancing As the song reaches a crescendo one or two dancers maintain the wild beat with their frantic movements ending in some cases in a trance

The costume of the performers is a sarong and a white short sleeved shirt

Boduberu evolved among the common citizens as an alternative to court music In the early days the people gathered together to perform Boduberu and it became widely accepted as the music of the common people The performing of the music is often referred as vibrating the island A notable point about Boduberu is its noise and sometimes meaningless lyrics sung The lyrics do not have a meaning because it consists of a mixture of local neighbouring and some African words Today meaningful songs written in the local language Dhivehi are sung to the rhythm of Boduberu

Boduberu is usually sung after a hard days work The location is up to the performers Today Boduberu is an important item of entertainment at stage shows celebrations and festivals

The bodu beru is a Maldivian drum made of wood from coconut tree trunk and often grouped in trios The instrument is used to accompany a dance of the same name the Boduberu

Stragrif is mentioned in the 1169 charter of Paisley Abbey which placed the churches of the area under the control of the new abbey Later the name Gryff is recorded in the Military Survey of Scotland 17471755 compiled by William Roy a predecessor to the Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain However it seems that Gryfe was the established usage until more recent times

The Gryffe name is becoming the predominant usage in the area seen for example in new signposts showing the name of the river and the names of organisations such as the Gryffe Valley Rotary Club and Gryffe High School in Houston Renfrewshire

There are a number of villages in Strathgryffe varying considerably in size The following straddle or are immediately adjacent to the River Gryffe

The geography of the area is a contrasting mix of green fields surrounding the river with rough moorland in the higher areas particularly Clyde Muirshiel Regional Park

Charles Vernon Culver
Charles Vernon Culver September 6 1830  January 10 1909 was a Republican member of the US House of Representatives from Pennsylvania

Culver was born in Logan Ohio He received a liberal preparatory schooling and attended the Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware Ohio He moved to Pennsylvania and settled in Reno Pennsylvania and engaged in mercantile pursuits He also became interested in the development of oil in Venango County Pennsylvania and the establishment of national banks in thirteen cities throughout the East

He was elected as a Republican to the Thirtyninth Congress He was not a candidate for renomination in 1866 While a member of Congress he became bankrupt and was imprisoned in 1866 but was eventually acquitted after a long trial He resumed operations in the oil business with headquarters in Franklin Pennsylvania He died while on a business trip in Philadelphia in 1909 He was interred in Franklin Cemetery in Franklin Pennsylvania

Culver had made a small profit in Logan Ohio by investing some bank money in oil He took that money and began buying up banks throughout the oil region He bought land two miles below Oil City Pennsylvania where he established the town of Reno and The Reno Oil and Land Company and starting selling stock in what appears to have been a basic pyramid scheme

Culver also attempted to establish the RenoPithole railroad to run between Reno and Pithole Pennsylvania the leading oil boom town at the time Culver was not one for half measuresto run the railroad he hired Ambrose Burnside and to hook investors he brought deeppocketed men of wealth from all over the country to tour his asyetnonexistent oil fields

Ultimately Culvers plan collapsed and he was pursued by creditors and courts up and down the oil region The collapse of his banks triggered a financial panic throughout the oil region that drove many oilmen out of the business and created chaos that set the stage for men like John D Rockefeller to move in

A more complete and colorful account of Culvers career can be found in the book The Great Oildorado by Hildegarde Dolson

Split nut
A split nut is a nut that is split lengthwise into two pieces opposed halves so that its female thread may be opened and closed over the male thread of a bolt or leadscrew This allows the nut when open to move along the screw without the screw turning or vice versa to allow the screw to pass through the nut without turning Then when the nut is closed it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel

A split nut assembly is often used in positioning systems for example in the leadscrew of a lathe It is one of the machine elements that makes singlepoint threading practical on manual nonCNC lathes The very earliest screwcutting lathes in the late 18th and early 19th centuries did not have them but within a few decades split nuts were common on lathes

The two halves of the nut have chamfered ends 60 to axis which helps the threads to find engagement during the closing action Usually the screw and nut are also oiled for lubrication Such provisions prolong the service life of the threads by minimizing wear

Split nuts work best with trapezoidal threads

Split nuts may not engage and disengage with multi start threads screw thread due to the overlapping leads

Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme
The Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme Somme Bay Railway is a preserved railway in northern France The railway is managed by a nonprofit organization which runs from March to December between the towns of the Baie de Somme area Le Crotoy and CayeuxsurMer via NoyellessurMer and SaintValerysurSomme on metre gauge tracks formerly part of Socit gnrale des chemins de fer conomiques The association was founded in 1970 and over the years it has become a major player in tourism development in the Picardy coast and is also responsible for the preservation safeguarding and enhancement of the fleet full of cars wagons steam locomotives and diesel locomotives The line is one of the closest French heritage lines to the UK Noyelles is from BoulognesurMer and from Calais A part of the line has dual gauge track and although forming part of a group of five lines at least a part of it has always been open to traffic

A branch to SaintValery had been proposed as early as 1845 In 1853 the Chemin de Fer du Nord was granted permission to build a single track branch from Noyelles to SaintValery This long line crossed the River Dien by means of a long wooden trestle bridge The original passenger station at SaintValery stood at the site later occupied by SaintValery Canal station The line opened to traffic on 5 June 1858 It was 1885 before the CF du Nord was able to get permission to use steam locomotives at SaintValerys docks horse power having to be used before them

In the 1880s there were various schemes to build narrow gauge lines of either or metre gauge in the Somme dpartement Eventually a metre gauge line nearly long was built by the Socit gnrale des chemins de fer conomiques SE from Noyelles to Le Crotoy opening on 1 July 1887 A second metre gauge line opened on 6 September 1887 from Noyelles to Cayeux from Noyelles with stations at SaintValery Ville and LanchresPend The line between Noyelles and SaintValery being laid between the rails of the standard gauge branch which was also extended into SaintValery Ville The line between Noyelles and SaintValery kept its Intrt Gnral status and the other lines had Intrt Local status with separate tickets being issued for each part of the route

The railway carried holidaymakers to seaside resorts and transporting local freight of galets sugar beet chicory and shellfish Running around the entire length of the Somme Bay in the Somme dpartement in Picardy northern France it connected Le Crotoy with NoyellessurMer SaintValerysurSomme and CayeuxsurMer including the sands at BrightonPlage Other minor stations or halts were provided near assorted villages hamlets and farms In its literature the operating Association claims that past passengers have included Colette Jules Verne Anatole France and ToulouseLautrec

These lines with two others were grouped together as the Rseau des Bains de Mer The other two lines were one from Noyelles to ForestlAbbaye and one from Abbeville to DompierresurAuthie which had a junction with the line from Noyelles at ForestlAbbaye The Rseau des Bains de Mer was a part of the 

The CFBS line was affected by three wars The FrancoPrussian War the First World War and the Second World War

France declared war on Prussia on 19 July 1870 SaintValery was a strategic port and thus its capture was an objective of the Prussians In October 1870 the French requisitioned Jules Vernes boat SaintMichel I for the defence of the Baie de Somme The boat was crewed by Crimean War veterans In December 1870 horses and equipment were requisitioned for use by the French cavalry A consignment of six hundred saddles left SaintValery by train for Noyelles on the 30 December The Prussians occupied SaintValery from February 1871 until September 1873

The CFBS line was particularly involved towards the end of the First World War starting with Operation Michael on 21 March 1918 It was realised that the German advance threatened the Allies ability to use railways in the area and that there was a lack of line capacity in certain places Therefore a double track standard gauge line was constructed linking the main line from Calais with the AbancourtSt Omer line The engineer Raoul Dautry claimed he could build the line in 100 days Work began on 15 May 1918 and the line opened to traffic on 15 August 1918 just 106 days later Thus the line was known as La Ligne de Cent Jours or The Line of One Hundred Days The line was last used on 1 January 1919 and the track lifted in March and April of that year thus ending the short life of the line

On 21 May 1940 German troops invaded the Baie de Somme area Noyelles was the scene of Allied air strikes on various occasions In September and October 1942 coastal defences were constructed in the Baie de Somme area In February 1944 the Germans flooded the lowlying land near Noyelles by blocking the River Dien where the railway to SaintValery crossed it by a long embankment this embankment had replaced a trestle in 1912 In April and May 1944 preparations were made to prevent the Allies from using the area to invade France

On 24 October 1941 a train was attacked at Noyelles and the locomotive was destroyed In November 1941 one of the metregauge trains was attacked between Noyelles and SaintValery with several railway workers wounded Cayeux saw much increased traffic in galets temporary gauge lines being laid on the beach and down the streets of the village A metregauge line was laid along the road from Lanchres to Ault on the standard gauge line from Woincourt to  with a branch or separate gauge line at Hautebut to a quarry near the coast The Germans brought in a number of locomotives to work these lines and after the war nine of them were dumped just outside SaintValery where three still remain a fourth having been removed for restoration in 1997  see below

On 2 December 1942 the water tower at SaintValery was destroyed On 4 May 1944 the depot at SaintValery along with two rail cars and a locomotive were destroyed by fire In June the SaintValery area was bombed as a diversion from the DDay landings On 19 August the Resistance blew up the water tower at Noyelles followed by an ammunition train on 1 September English and Polish troops relieved SaintValery on 2 September and proceeded to bombard the Germans across the bay at Le Crotoy

The main types of freight carried by the railway were

A chicory processing works was built at SaintValery Canal A siding was laid in 1929 to serve it The derelict building was demolished in 1998

The main sugar beet season was from October to January thus providing useful income out of the tourist season A raperie shredding plant was built at Lanchres It had its own railway system and locomotives which also worked on the CFBS line to Noyelles

Before the railway came the port of SaintValery handled galets flint or silica pebbles brought on rafts from Cayeux The galets were used in the building and ceramics industries

Local shellfish taken from the Baie de Somme were sent to market at Abbeville Shellfish not available locally were also brought in to Le Crotoy for use in a restaurant there

SaintValery handled timber jute textiles soap phosphates and coal Phosphates were mined at CrcyenPonthieu and transported via a metre gauge line from there to Noyelles and thence to SaintValery Freight between Noyelles and SaintValery was sometimes carried in standard gauge wagons but hauled by the metre gauge locomotives This practice continued until 1973

After the Second World War a plan was put forward to extend the standard gauge to Le Crotoy and Cayeux with a new line to at a cost of some FRF150200 million In 1963 another proposal was made to extend the dual gauge track to Lanchres at a cost of some FRF93 million Even as late as 1968 plans were being proposed to extend the standard gauge to Cayeux this time with the closure of the branch to Le Crotoy

The line from SaintValery Ville to Cayeux was relaid with rails recovered from the standard gauge WoincourtOrival line which closed to passengers in May 1939 and completely from 1 January 1947 In 1949 the CFBS acquired some second hand steam locomotives after the closure of the Rseau Albert Three secondhand railcars were acquired in 1955 and a new railcar was acquired in 1957 along with two second hand diesel locomotives A third diesel locomotive was acquired in 1960 In 1971 a pair of De DionBouton type OC1 bogie railcars X157 and X158 were acquired from the Rseau Breton RB having been previously used on the Chemin de Fer des CtesduNord CdN X158 was subsequently transferred to the Chemins de Fer de la Corse and is now preserved by the CdN Society at Langueux A trailing railcar was also acquired from the RB in 1971 having previously been built as a powered railcar

The CFBS steam locomotives were mainly confined to the sugar beet trains after the war The very last CFBS steam train running on 5 April 1959 The steam locomotive from the raperie at Lanchres worked until 1965 The raperie itself closed in 1966 at the end of the 6566 season

Even as late as 1958 the CFBS lines were carrying some 5055000 tonnes of freight including 3540000 tonnes of sugar beet and 10000 tonnes of galets In that year a railcar caught fire at Cayeux and the fire destroyed the loco shed which was rebuilt In 1961 the SE merged with the Compagnie Gnrale de Chemins de Fer et de Transports Automobiles CFTA The CFTA had interests in road transport and instigated a system of rationalisation and cuts The company livery changed from green to red and cream Both goods and passenger traffic declined during the middle 60s and the line from Noyelles to Le Crotoy closed with effect from 31 December 1969 CFTA worked the line to Cayeux for three more years galets being carried by rail as late as 1970 The line from SaintValery to Cayeux closed with effect from 31 December 1972 The SNCF continued to use the standard gauge line between Noyelles and SaintValery for occasional freight trains The SNCF line between Noyelles and SaintValery was last used on 6 February 1989 and closed with effect from 1 January 1993

Local opposition to the closure of the line to Le Crotoy was strong and a preservation group was formed on 13 November 1969 initially under the name of Association Ferroviaire Picardie and from 14 March 1970 the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme CFBS The initial aim of the society was to preserve the line from Noyelles to Le Crotoy as a tourist line The first tourist trains ran on 4 July 1971 but although the railway had permission from SNCF to run into Noyelles they were not allowed to drop or collect passengers there under an agreement with the local bus company This arrangement lasting until 1986

With the announcement that the Cayeux line was to close the CFBS set up a new company the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer Touristiques et Industriels de Picardie CFTIP which was founded 17 April 1973 From 1973 to 1981 it was the CFTIP rather than the CFBS which was responsible for running the trains The CFTIP was unsuccessful in its bid to take over the freight traffic from Noyelles to SaintValery from SNCF In 1976 there was a split within the CFBSCFTIP a splinter group the Chemin de Fer Touristique de la Cte dOpale CFTO running trains between SaintValery Ville and Cayeux The CFTO folded in December 1977 and the Cayeux line reverted to the CFTIP By the late 1970s the growth in the numbers of passengers meant that more coaches were needed but those inherited from the SECFTA were in poor condition Nine coaches were acquired from Switzerland between 1978 and 1984

The CFBS again suffered a drop in passengers in the early 80s but in 1982 the CFTIP was wound up and the CFBS confirmed as its successor in an agreement with SNCF and the Somme Dpartement
At the end of the operation of the public service by the CFTA an association of volunteers passionate about railways the nonprofit Association of Railway Bay of Somme SFBC established on March 13 1970 decides to operate as a tourist railway line Sea Baths group linking NoyellessurMer in Crotoy closed since December 31 1969  The operation of the line is then only during the summer Winter is conducive to maintenance of the line and equipment

Thanks to the financial support of different institutions the municipalities served Grand Picardy coast formerly SMACOPI General Council Regional Council State  DRAC European Union etc enabled the CFBS to perform maintenance of the tracks stations and equipment All this caused a continuous increase in the number of visitors in the mid 1990s which increased from 20 000 to 100 000 per year In 2011 the association exceeded the symbolic threshold of 150000 passengers and there were more than 162 000 passengers carried in 2013

Although the whole line is preserved the section from SaintValery to Cayeux is operated only on certain days between April and September including all save 4 days in July and August Five of the minor stations or halts are still in use in addition to the stations in the above named towns

The SFBC is an association made up of over 400 members including at least 80 active volunteers and employs the equivalent of 22 fulltime employees The CFBS selffinances its operating costs salaries maintenance coal etc and participates in investments facilities infrastructure equipment etc

The CFBS operates its network with metergauge track but dualgauge track remains between the station Noyelles and SaintValery Port Transhipment facilities for cargo still exist in Noyelles that are used in every Steam Festival
The various lines are single track with passing loops in the station allowing trains to cross
Except Noyelles station equipped with a mechanical signaling system of the old SNCF type there is little signalling on the line and traffic safety is ensured by instructions A Line Manager ensures the operational use of the network and can communicate by groundtotrain radio with all trains Automatic level crossings are installed at intersections with major roads and unguarded crossings to other crossings
The workshop equipment is installed in SaintValery Canal Station Turntables exist at Noyelles SaintValery Ville and Port Le Crotoy and at Cayeux However the locomotives can travel in both directions of traffic without being rotated E332 is the only CFBS locomotive which cannot be turned on any of the turntable except SaintValery Port

There is still a track connection with the SNCF which is commonly used during the Steam Festival

The line from Noyelles sur Mer to Le Crotoy is metre gauge

The line from Noyelles sur Mer to SaintValery Ville is of dual gauge with metre gauge tracks laid within standard gauge track thus having four rails At SaintValery there is a branch to the SaintValery docks which is dual gauge but having three rails only The line from SaintValery Ville to Cayeux Brighton Plage is metre gauge

The Festival of steam was organized for the first time in 1988 on the occasion of the centenary of the Network de Bains de Mer The CFBS organized a steam engine rally in NoyellessurMer the point of correspondence between the Network Bains de Mer and that of the SNCF  It quickly became a major event and the CFBS reorganizes it every three years with many steam engines from all over the Europe It has become a major event for lovers of railways but also for the people of the Somme bay and tourists The railway is of course put forward but also the tractors buses rolls saws  and many other machines from the past are exhibited

KSYN
KSYN 925 FM known as Kissin 925 is a CHR radio station licensed to Joplin Missouri It serves the FourState Region Cities in KSYNs primary coverage area include Joplin Neosho Monett and Nevada Missouri Pittsburg Parsons Fort Scott and Chanute Kansas Miami and Vinta Oklahoma and Bella Vista Rogers and Bentonville Arkansas

FounderKSYN was founded in 1960 by William B Bill Neal Following an injury that occurred during the Battle of the Bulge Neal was transferred to Paris France where he began his career in broadcasting with the Armed Forces Radio Service In addition to KSYN Neal owned WMBH and founded Joplin AM station KQYX In 2000 Neal was awarded the Pioneer in Broadcasting Award from Missouri Southern State University in recognition of his work in the development of FM radio and for his role in popularizing the modern AM talk radio format He is also one of only six individuals to be honored with the Lifetime Member award from the Missouri Broadcasters Association

The 1960s  1970sOn December 19 1960 KSYN became the first FM radio station to operate in the Four State Region It was the tenth FM station established in Missouri and the states most powerful with a 100000 watt tower that stood more than 90 stories tall In these early days KSYN could be heard clearly as far away as Kansas City Missouri and Tulsa Oklahoma

While the increasing popularity of Rock n Roll helped propel KSYNs rapid ascent to number one in listener ratings Neal still had to overcome a fundamental problem few people in those days owned FM receivers To meet this challenge KSYN provided free radios to area businesses and organizations so that they could hear for themselves the differences in sound quality between AM and FM A small black and silver sign was provided with each radio for display reading The Wonderful Sound of FM  KSYN To reach mobile listeners the station gave away hundreds of FM car radios at live remotes and on the air to callers who answered trivia questions correctly To those unable to obtain free FM radios the station offered receivers for sale at wholesale prices

During this period KSYN was known for largescale innovative promotions In a 2000 interview with Missouri Southern State University Bill Neal remarked that Radio is about promotion Translating this philosophy into action the station regularly underwrote the costs of bringing popular artists to Joplin It also developed an annual KSYN Olympics which was held at Wildcat Park and Shadow Lake Events included bikini contests boat races and numerous other competitions designed to entertain the large and often raucous crowds One particularly memorable promotion involved a helicopter that showered 40000 in cash and prizes over downtown Joplin This promotion effectively closed downtown for a day leading the city to inform the station owner that any future permit applications would not be viewed favorably

In the late 1960s and throughout most of the 1970s broadcasting hall of fame announcer Bob James hosted a popular news talk show on Sunday mornings that featured local and state public officials high school and college coaches and other newsmakers James is perhaps best known for his coverage of the Connor Hotel collapse which occurred November 11 1978 During the days following the incident KSYN provided indepth coverage of the events from its mobile news unit which was parked downtown near what remained of the hotel James reporting focused on the search and rescue efforts for three men who were trapped beneath the rubble When after 77 hours rescue workers found one of the men alive in a corner of the hotels basement James was there to report the news that so many had been waiting to hear With Bob James as News Director KSYN was an important source for both news and entertainment

The 1980sKSYN may have reached its apex in terms of popularity and influence in the early and middle 1980s In 1985 for example KSYN had 175 percent of the total listenership winning the top spot for every segment of the day Radio was still largely free of competition from other music delivery platforms MTV was just catching on and the internet MP3 players and satellite radio had yet to be created 

Rather than sitting back and allowing the popularity of the format to carry the station Bill Neal sought to cement KSYN as an indelible part of local popular culture He accomplished this by further accelerating promotional activities During these years KSYN tee shirts and bumper stickers were ubiquitous throughout the Four State Area The station regularly gave away thousands of dollars in cash not to mention countless tee shirts hats cases of soft drinks and Worlds of Fun tickets And KSYN didnt just broadcast the music it brought the artists who made the music to Joplin sponsoring top shelf acts such as Joan Jett and The Blackhearts Jefferson Starship Air Supply Stevie Ray Vaughan John Waite Survivor Night Ranger and Cheap Trick In addition KSYNs current moniker draws its heritage from this period when in the early 1980s it was known as Kissin 925 Your Number One Hit Music Leader

The 1990sLed by Tulsa Oklahomas Garth Brooks the early 1990s saw a powerful resurgence in country music Seemingly overnight country overtook rock as the most popular radio format Put simply country was in and rock was out This phenomenon knocked KSYN from atop the listener ratings for consecutive years for the first time in its history And while country musics popularity has receded from this highwater mark it remains to this day the most popular format in the Four State Region

Although the early 1990s and country music brought an end to KSYNs 40year reign at the pinnacle of listener ratings this period is not without its high points Chief among these is that the broadcasting station was refurbished Compact disk players replaced tapes and records improving sound quality Computers took the place of several refigeratorsized mechanical processors enhancing programming reliability And remote satellite programs replaced overnight announcers saving costs while adding an element of national entertainment to the lineup In short the station took a giant leap toward the 21st Century

By 1995 rock had begun to recover and so had KSYNs listener ratings Given the overall favorable dynamics it was in this year that William B Neal chose to conclude his career in broadcastinga career that spanned more than a half centuryby selling KSYN to Big Mack Broadcasting Inc Big Mack was owned by Chuck Dunaway who was like his predecessor an influential figure within the radio business having been inducted into both the Texas and Ohio Broadcasting Halls of Fame

Chuck Dunaways career in radio began in 1952 as an announcer for KBST in Big Spring Texas Quickly rising through the ranks in the late 1950s he assumed the afternoon drivetime slot for New Yorks top rated station WABCAM Dunaway eventually parlayed his success as an announcer into station proprietorship purchasing his first radio station in 1982 and eventually owning six in the Joplin market alone Under Dunaways relatively brief period of ownership KSYN continued much as it had under Neal Chuck Dunaways legacy at KSYN could be described as that of a steady and experienced hand who bridged the gap between longterm owners

The Modern Era
If one were looking to quickly categorize KSYNs history it could be logically divided into two parts the William B Neal era which spans from 1960 to 1995 and the James L Zimmer era which began in 1998 and continues into the present

Since 1998 KSYN has been owned by James L Jim Zimmer under the Zimmer familys Zimmer Radio Group 19982006 and Zimmer Radio Inc 2007present During the Zimmer era the station has been brought fully into the modern computer age and KSYNs position near the top of listener surveys has been reestablished

Under Zimmer KSYN became only the second station in the FourState Region to begin broadcasting in HD Radio and was one of the first to embrace the internet platform for content distribution The stations HD2 channel Kissin HD2 offers improved sound quality and a slightly different format than the primary Kissin 925 in the form of more urban oriented music

Godai later returned to Europe to negotiate with the Comte des Cantons de Charles Montblanc 18321893 to establish a joint venture commercial enterprise for the development of Satsumas natural resources in exchange for European weapons and manufactured goods This FrenchSatsuma trading company attracted French investment into the Satsuma domain to establish a steamship shipyard and textile silk spinning factories and to send promising students from Satsuma overseas Its existence also allowed Satsuma to participate as if it were an independent country in the Paris Exhibition of 1867 much to the consternation of the Tokugawagovernment representatives At the same time Godai used his contacts to purchase the latest warships to equip the Satsuma in preparation with the growing conflict to overthrow the Tokugawa regime

After the Meiji Restoration Godai became a Sanyo junior councilor and used his foreign experience to defuse a number of incidents created against foreigners by xenophobic exsamurai He resigned from government service in 1869 and turned his full attention to business Basing himself in Osaka he created several major joint stock companies involved in international trade commerce and shipping which he operated simultaneously Godai went on to found the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and the Osaka Stock Exchange He also participated in the Osaka Conference of 1875 which attempted to hold together the fragile coalition of feudal domains which dominated the early Meiji government

The Inspector General 1949 film
The Inspector General is a 1949 Technicolor musical comedy film It stars Danny Kaye and was directed by Henry Koster The film also stars Walter Slezak Gene Lockhart Barbara Bates Elsa Lanchester Alan Hale Sr and Rhys Williams Original music by Sylvia Fine and Johnny Green

The film is loosely based on Nikolai Gogols play The Inspector General The plot is relocated from the Russian Empire into an unspecified corrupted region of a country that suddenly finds itself under the supervision of the First French Empire

Georgi Danny Kaye an illiterate member of a wandering band of Gypsies led by Yakov Walter Slezak escapes from a travelling medicine show after he innocently lets slip that the elixir theyre selling is a fraud Tired and hungry he wanders into the small town of Brodny and whilst trying to sample the contents of a horses feedbag hes arrested as a vagrant and sentenced to hang the next day by a corrupt police chief Alan Hale Sr desperate to prove his efficiency

The town is run by a corrupt Mayor Gene Lockhart whose employees and councillors are all his cousins and equally corrupt and incompetent but they are frightened when they learn that the Inspector General is in their neighborhood and probably in disguise The band of officials and the mayor want to protect their town and their lives so acting foolishly they seal off every road to keep the inspector from entering their town They mistake Georgi for the Inspector and ply him with food and drink whilst plotting to have him killed Yakov wanders into the small town and convinces Georgi to stay on as an inspector general and accept the bribes the officials so willingly throw at him Of course Yakov wants to seize Georgis misfortune and turn it into a new start for his own life

Meanwhile hearing tales of his legacy and courageous efforts the mayors wife instantly takes a liking to Georgi hoping he will fall in love with her and whisk her away from the mayor and his lack of attention to her However Georgi has fallen in love with a servant and wishes to marry her

Naturally their plans go awry and Georgi despite his innocence discovers how corrupt they really are And when the real Inspector arrives suddenly he also realizes that Georgi is the most honest fellow hes met since leaving Budapest The Inspector General names Georgi the new Mayor of Brodny and presents him the mayoral gold chain having taken it from the old mayor saying Well put something else around your neck Yakov becomes the new chief of police and Georgi gets the girl of his dreams


Johnny Green won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Score for his work on the film Kayes wife Sylvia Fine wrote the original songs The Inspector General and Happy Times both sung by Kaye in the film Happy Times was in fact the working title of the film
According to Warner Bros records the film earned 2154000 domestically and 1756000 foreign
The Inspector General is one of a number of major Hollywood productions from the 1940s and 1950s that have lapsed into the public domain in the United States The last copyright holder was United Artists Television later MetroGoldwynMayer and Turner Entertainment

Fort Terry
Fort Terry was a coastal fortification on Plum Island a small island just off Orient Point New York USA This strategic position afforded it a commanding view over the Atlantic entrance to the commercially vital Long Island Sound It was established in 1897 and used intermittently through the end of World War II In 1952 it became a military animal and biological warfare BW research facility moving to civilian control in 1954 as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center However the biological warfare mission continued under civilian control until 1969 when the US ended offensive BW research The island is now being considered for sale or conversion to a wildlife refuge

First owned by the Corchaug and Montaukett Indian tribes the Plum Island was sold to Samuel Wyllys for a coat a barrel of biscuits and 100 fishhooks The original fort was constructed after the federal government acquired Plum Island from Abraham S Hewitt a former mayor of New London Connecticut for 25000 It is not clear how Hewitt became owner of the property

Fort Terry named for Major General Alfred Terry began construction in 1897 under the Endicott Program as part of the Harbor Defenses of Long Island Sound and was expanded several times from the time of the SpanishAmerican War through World War II The initial federal purchase was for 150 acres however the rest of the island was turned over to the federal government in 1901

In 1898 before any of Fort Terrys batteries were completed the SpanishAmerican War broke out It was feared the Spanish fleet would bombard the US east coast A number of weapons were purchased from the UK and hastily mounted to give the nascent fort system some modern armament By March 1898 a 47 inch45 caliber gun was mounted at Battery Kelly under this program It was later transferred to the Sandy Hook Proving Ground in New Jersey possibly in 1903 A pair of emplacements for modern 8inch M1888 guns on modified 1870sera Rodman carriages were also built at nearby Fort Tyler but these seem to have not been armed

Between 1897 and 1906 the following batteries were constructed at Fort Terry

Battery Stoneman was named in honor of Brevet Bvt Major General MG George Stoneman who served with distinction during the US Civil War died 5 Sep 1894 Battery Steele was named in honor of Bvt MG Frederick Steele US Army who served with distinction during the MexicanAmerican War and the US Civil War and who died on 12 Jan 1868 Battery Bradford was named on March 13 1902 in honor of Captain James Bradford US Artillery who was killed on November 4 1791 in action with hostile Indians at Fort Recovery Ohio Battery Floyd was named in honor of 2nd Lt Robert Floyd 3rd US Artillery mortally wounded in the Battle of Chickamauga GA died on 23 Sep 1863 Battery Dimick was named in honor of Justin E Dimick an artillery officer mortally wounded in the Battle of Chancellorsville VA died on 5 May 1863 Battery Eldridge was named in honor of Capt Bogardus Eldridge US Infantry who was killed in action at Bocoor Philippine Islands 2 Oct 1899 Battery Dalliba was named in honor of Bvt Major James Dalliba assistant commissary of ordnance who served 18111824 and died 8 Nov 1832 Battery Greble was named in honor of 1st Lt John Greble 2nd US Artillery killed in action at the Battle of Big Bethel 10 Jun 1861

Battery Steele was unusual in that the two 10inch gun emplacements are on different levels on a hillside

As an artillery post Fort Terry was heavily armed as part of the Coast Defenses of Long Island Sound The Armys forts of this type were garrisoned by the Coast Artillery Corps By 1914 the fort had 11 gun batteries and facilities to control an underwater minefield In addition the post was home to an advanced fire control system for both the guns and the minefield The grounds also had a functional 36 gauge railroad built in 1914 The Porter locomotive was used to haul munitions from bunkers to the artillery batteries

Fort Terry served as an artillery post during the SpanishAmerican War and it was intended to attack enemy ships as they headed toward New York City Organized in 1907 it was initially manned by the 133rd Company Coast Artillery Corps organized in 1907 In 1916 they were redesignated as the 3d Company and continued to serve in that capacity throughout World War I Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Hero Jr was in command of the post in August 1915

Following the American entry into World War I in April 1917 changes were made at the stateside forts with a view to putting some coast artillery weapons into the fight on the Western Front The Coast Artillery Corps manned almost all US heavy and railway artillery in that war with stateside forts reduced to a minimum garrison to provide gun crews in France The forts were also important as mobilization and training centers The four 6inch guns of Batteries Floyd and Dimick were dismounted in 1917 to be mounted on field carriages for service in France The pair of 5inch guns of Battery Kelly were apparently remounted at Fort H G Wright until scrapped in 1919 The 6inch guns appear to have arrived in France but for lack of training time none of the 5inch or 6inch batteries saw action in that war The guns were never returned to Fort Terry In 1918 four of Battery Stonemans mortars were removed this was to improve reloading time as reloading four mortars simultaneously in one pit was cumbersome Many of the mortars removed under this program became railway artillery but none of these were shipped to France during the war

Following the end of World War I Fort Terry was declared surplus and put under the control of personnel at Fort HG Wright in caretaker status Two antiaircraft batteries with two guns each were built in 1920 probably armed with the 3inch gun M1917 In 1924 Fort Terry was used by the Portsmouth NH National Guard Armory the 197th Coast Artillery Regiment Antiaircraft as their summer encampment and training location The gun and machine gun battalions worked on night firing solutions at aerial balloon targets tracked by the searchlight battalion In 1930 the federal census for New York identified 133 people living on Fort Terry In 1930 the Justice Department conducted a study on building a 1000cell prison on the island but it was deemed impractical and was not built In 193234 the 3inch gun batteries Hagner Greble and Campbell were disarmed

During World War II the post was put to use as a training facility and supply depot and as a lookout for German Uboats and planes On 7 December 1941 the fort was listed as manned by the 242nd Coast Artillery Regiment Harbor Defense of the Connecticut Army National Guard Today on the east side of Plum Island a network of trenches remains from the areas tenure as an artillery post Fort Terrys guns were superseded by the pair of 16inch batteries at Camp Hero in Montauk by 1944 so all except the four 3inch guns of Batteries Eldridge and Dalliba were scrapped

During World War II the following batteries were built at Fort Terry

After World War II it was determined that gun coast defenses were obsolete In 1948 the fort was once again declared surplus and disarmed with all guns scrapped

Beginning April 15 1952 it served as a US Army Chemical Corps facility As such it was under the control of the First Army It was small and focused primarily on antianimal biological warfare BW research aimed at enemy livestock Antianimal agents rinderpest and foot and mouth disease were the main areas of research When the decision to use the Fort as a research facility was planned it was envisioned that it would be staffed by less than 20 personnel

Fort Terrys Chemical Corps installation covered three acres and included many of the amenities traditionally associated with US military installations Included on the grounds were various administration buildings laboratories a dock a motor pool a commissary a hospital a fire station staff housing and animal housing

When the Chemical Corps took control of Fort Terry in 1952 it required the remodeling of 18 original buildings on post The Army had been developing plans for the animal disease facility at Fort Terry since 1951 A laboratory was planned for the circa 1911 Building 257 originally known as Combined Torpedo Storehouse and Cable Tanks building The lab was not completed by the time the Chemical Corps transferred the fort to the USDA but it and the rest of the remodeled buildings were eventually incorporated into the civilian facility

In 1954 the US Department of Agriculture USDA took over the island and began to use it as the Plum Island Animal Disease Center It was then staffed by at least 9 military and 8 civilian employees
Most of the disease research done by the USDA focused on biological warfare until Richard Nixon ended the US bioweapons program in 1969 Most of the original buildings and batteries still stand today and in many cases have been incorporated in one way or another into the islands new role as a disease research center

As of August 2001 the fort and all of Plum Island was listed for sale with the Government Accounting Office under FORT TERRY POW SUBSTA number C02NY0619 as accepting bids with 12000 cost up to date for historical clean up It is listed as no further action that is no cleanup is needed under the FUDS cleanup program no DODrelated hazards present

In June 2003 the responsibility for Plum Island facilities was transferred from the USDA to the US Department of Homeland Security

A 2008 DHS report recommended that the remnants of Fort Terry its buildings and batteries be opened to the public and preserved The Town of Southold New York formed a Local Waterfront Revitalization Program LWRP which noted that many of the islands structures including those at Fort Terry could qualify for listing on the US National Register of Historic Places

On 16 May 2016 the House unanimously passed Save Dont Sell Plum Island Bill HR 1887 reversing the 2008 decision to put the island up for sale which would lead to the destruction of the island and lead to future development

The original antianimal biological warfare research mission at Fort Terry was to establish and pursue a program of research and development of certain antianimal biological warfare agents The first agent that was a candidate for development was foot and mouth disease FMD Besides FMD five other top secret BW projects were commissioned on Plum Island The other four programs researched included Rift Valley fever RVF rinderpest African swine fever and a slew of miscellaneous exotic animal diseases Among the miscellaneous diseases were 11 other animal pathogens Shortly before the handover of the facility to the Department of Agriculture in 1954 Fort Terrys mission was altered The number of pathogens studied was reduced to two rinderpest and FMD and the mission was changed to defensive research of those two diseases

<doc id="7741574" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7741574" title="Chumash traditional narratives">
Chumash traditional narratives
Chumash traditional narratives include myths legends tales and oral histories preserved by the Chumash people of the northern and western Transverse Ranges Santa BarbaraVentura coast and northern Channel Islands in presentday Southern California

Early analysts expected Chumash oral literature to conform to the regional pattern of Southern California narratives However little evidence was available before accounts from the papers of John Peabody Harrington began to be published in the 1970s The narratives now seem to have stronger ties with central California than with the Takic and Yuman groups to the south

Despite their close ties to the Chumash Spanish sources did little to collect information on native oral culture In addition the Chumash were roughly divided into 8 separate linguistic groups Obispeo Purismeo Inezeo Barbareo Ventureo Island Cuyama and Emigdiao varied to a degree where they were closer to separate languages than similar dialects The Chumash werent a cultural or linguistic sovereignty in the traditional sense they were a conglomeration of autonomous settlements Most recording of Chumash narratives occurred through anthropological study specifically Harringtons papers

Like other Native American universes the Chumash mythical universe is ordered but still very uncertain Events occur at the whim of supernatural beings capable of kindness and malevolence Supernatural beings can be both rational and irrational at times as humans may be Chumash narratives vary in plot but the heros journey and tricksters story appear frequently in Chumash oral culture The motives inspiring the protagonist however appear dubious by Western standards Whereas Western fictional heroes are called to action and make decisions based off a clear set of choices Chumash protagonists act based on an abstruse imperative or must

Magic and death also appear commonly as literary devices Conflict often arises between beings with innate magical powers and those who acquired their powers through magical objects or helpers Death wherever it occurred in native stories was always reversible and was usually undone with the aid of the aforementioned magical powers or special medicines bearing similar supernatural powers Another commonly used literary device was inversion where the opposite of whats to be expected occurs ex supernatural beings consume only toxic materials or events occurring at day versus night in the human world are chronologically switched in the underworld

Time is not a strongly defined topic in Chumash folklore Very little detail is placed on the creation of the universe and theres little chronological order to narratives suggesting that Chumash culture valued the idea of progress over time in a different way than the West The universe was believed to have changed only very slightly in its history one of the few transformative events was the Flood The Flood was believed to have transformed the socalled First People into present day plants and animals Modern humans were created by supernatural powers and death was introduced to deal with overpopulation The Flood separated Chumash mythology into an unspecified indeterminate past and the world we see today Chumash narratives would transform further with the arrival of Europeans

Again similar to Western folklore Chumash narratives often began and ended with idiomatic phrases When Coyote was human or Momoy was a rich Widow analogous to Once upon a time in Western culture were introductions to stories about the two most commonly seen characters in Chumash narratives As the West had and they lived happily ever after so the Chumash had an idiomatic expression roughly translating to I am finished it is the end Most storytelling occurred at night and some stories were told only in Winter The Chumash highly valued storytellers and certain narratives were made privy only to subjects of certain social status Chumash storytellers would integrate stories from elsewhere into their own beliefs but despite this Chumash narratives are significantly distinct from those of neighboring cultures

The Chumash believed their universe was divided into at least 3 worlds and groups of beings The Middle world is occupied by humans The first world above belongs to supernatural beings such as the Sun and the Giant Eagle The first world below is inhabited by monsters which enter the human world after dark People were believed to be able to travel between worlds but not without difficulty

Prior to the Flood the First People dwelled in the Middle world These people were thought to be largely humanoid with some floral or faunal characteristics related to the plants or animals they would become after the Flood Unlike other native groups the Chumash excluded much of the animal kingdom from their folklore Most of the animals mentioned are birds Plants reptiles mammals and insects are mentioned occasionally and fish only have one representative among the First People Bears rattlesnakes elk whales and other seemingly impressive animals dont appear as characters in Chumash folklore

Among the First People Coyote appears the most in Chumash narratives as the archetype herotrickster Coyote can be thought of as an analogy for man he has conflicting virtues and vices Often portrayed as an old man Coyote is powerful and knowledgeable but wasnt born into the high social stratus of the supernatural beings like the Great Eagle Also featured prominently among the First People was Momoy Momoy depicted as an old woman turned into Datura meteloides a narcotic plant after the Flood She was a wealthy widow who lived in a faraway place alone or with a daughter She herself doesnt bear power within the universe but she can take brief glimpses into the future and inform individuals only the probable outcomes of their actions One who drinks the water that Momoy uses to wash her hands will fall into a coma and receive visions pertaining to their future or destiny

According to legends the middle world was supported above the world below by two giant serpents whose movements would cause earthquakes The world above was held in place by the Giant Eagle The middle world was believed to be flat and circular with a number of islands floating on an ocean The Chumash live on the largest most central island To the West exists the land of the dead filled with souls waiting to be reborn The land of the dead contains 3 areas similar to purgatory heaven and hell  wit ayaya and imilaqa

In Chumash folklore the soul is a separate entity from the body but one only experiences their soul separating from their body at least 3 days after death or as a harbinger of death In the case where a living person saw their own soul it was possible to avoid death by ingesting Momoy or toloache Immediately following death the soul oversees the destruction of their property and revisits locations frequented in life before heading Westward to the land of the dead in a ball of light

The soul first encounters two widows who live by merely smelling food and water and bathe themselves in a spring The soul then travels to a ravine where it must pass two deadly boulders and two giant ravens who attempt to peck out the eyes of the soul replacing them with poppies Then the soul must pass a tall woman with a scorpionlike tail She draws attention by clapping and will sting anyone who comes too near Finally the soul reaches the ocean spanned by a single bridge or pole Beneath the consistently rising and falling bridge exists evil souls petrified from the neck down Two monsters attempt to scare the traveling soul who if lacking requisite knowledge or power will fall into the sea and be transformed into a fish or amphibian Souls who pass this final test enjoy imilaqa a land ruled by a chief in a crystal house the Sun Here one will eat sleep and play for eternity or until they are reincarnated

The discussion of who enters imilaqa varies among Chumash groups The Ventureo for example believe the spirits of children and those who drown do not enter imilaqa but will be reincarnated after 12 years

The world above was inhabited by supernatural beings such as the Sun the Two Thunders and the elyewun or Giant Eagle They generally exist in human form but have supernatural powers and usually only intervene in human affairs to a minimal extent They can be malevolent if so inclined and have more control over the universe than any other beings

The Sun was portrayed as an extremely old widower living with two daughters in a crystal house He and his daughters subsist off human flesh and bones He wears nothing but a feathered headband in which he tucks the bodies of small children He carries a torch made of bark which he uses to light the world beneath him His daughters wear aprons made of live rattlesnakes Every day the Sun travels a path around the world and returns to his daughters with corpses to eat Every day the Sun plays peon with the Great Eagle against the Coyote of the Sky and the Morning Star On the Winter solstice the Moon decides who has won the game for the year If the Sun wins there will be a rainy year and bountiful crop yields If the Sun loses more people will suffer and die Some Chumash families apparently stayed indoors all day during the Winter solstice

The Great Eagle was seen as a handsoff leader of the first peoples social order The Great Eagle would spend most of his time in the first world meditating lost in thought His relatives falcon and two hawks play a more active leadership role The roles of everyone else of the first people follow no distinct hierarchy and reflect societal roles and positions of the Chumash themselves

The Coyote of the Sky appears to be one of the few supernatural powers largely trusted by the Chumash The Coyote of the Sky was believed to support the welfare of the first people and humans below The Inezeo view him as a father figure and pray to him specifically

The monsters of the world below however were thought to be intrinsically malevolent supernatural beings that always pose a threat to humans They were often described as grotesque nocturnal and misshapen

Universal Tube  Rollform Equipment Corporation is an American manufacturer and supplier of metal machine tubes and pipes that is based in Perrysburg Ohio Founded in 1985 the company specializes in buying and selling tube mills pipe mills and rollforming machines

The company became known to much wider audiences because its original domain name uTubecom appeared to be very similar to YouTubecom The company had purchased the domain name in October 1996 In August 2006 the companys website received 68 million hits which led to its servers crashing Many of the users intended to go to the video sharing website YouTube but typed the homophonic utubecom into their browser instead On October 30 2006 the company took legal action against YouTube over the website confusion The company has since moved their domain website to utubeonlinecom in April 2006

The case appears to have been settled in late 2007 when Universal Tube withdrew its opposition to several YouTube trademark filings by the videosharing website saying that The parties have settled their dispute UTubecom remains active and shows large banner ads presumably because the large numbers of hits that UTube still receives will generate extra ad revenue

Emmanuel Adriaenssen
Emmanuel Adriaenssen c 1554 in Antwerp  buried 27 February 1604 in Antwerp was a Flemish lutenist composer and master of music He authored he influential Pratum Musicum which contains scores for lute solos and more importantly settings of madrigals for multiple lutes and different ensembles involving lutes and voices He also had an important influence on the next generation of lutists through his activity as a teacher of music in his own music school
Emmanuel Adriaenssen was born in Antwerp between 1540 and 1555 Little is known about his early life and training It is known that he travelled to Rome in 1574 to study music Upon his return to Antwerp he started a lute school with his brother Gysbrecht The brothers had in 1587 a conflict with the musicians guild of Antwerp because they practised as musicians without becoming members of the guild Emanuel later became a master of the guild 

He married Sybilla Crelin in 1584 with whom he had six sons and one daughter Their sons Alexander 15871661 Vincent 15951675 and Niclaes 15981658 became respectively a still life painter a battle painter and a portrait painter Prior to the Fall of Antwerp Emmanuel was likely a Calvinist as he only had his first son baptised in a Catholic after the Fall of Antwerp He was registered as a Catholic in the purge records of the Antwerp civic guard after the Fall of Antwerp His wealth and good connections with the higher circles of Anwerp society may have protected him Emmanuel was later appointed captain of the civic guard an activity providing a regular income In 1595 he took part in the liberation of the neighboring town of Lier which had been occupied by troops of the Dutch Republic

Adriaenssen became a welloff burgher who frequented the local notables including probably from the nobility who valued his virtuosity on the lute He gained an international reputation thanks to his publications of lute music which found their way into the libraries of illustrious people such as Philips of Marnix Lord of SaintAldegonde Constantijn Huygens King John IV of Portugal and Cardinal Mazarin Composers Adrian Denss 1594 Robert Dowland 1610 Georg Leopold Fuhrmann 1615 JeanBaptiste Besard 1617 Wolfgang Printz 1690 and Ernst Gottlieb Baron 1727 mention him as a leading composer for lute As a teacher he played an important role because of the outstanding tablatures that he published and because he was the initiator of an Antwerp lute school whose pupils included in all likelihood Denss and Joachim van den Hove

Emmanuel Adriaenssen died in Antwerp between 2 February 1604 the date on which he made his last will and 27 February 1604 the date of is funeral and burial in the St James Church Antwerp His wife remarried and emigrated later to Leiden in the Dutch Republic taking her youngest son Niclaes with her

The Pratum Musicum was first published in Antwerp in 1584 and was reprinted with alterations several times until 1600 They constitute 3 editions


The Pratum Musicum contains lute solos and more importantly settings of madrigals for multiple lutes and different ensembles involving lutes and voices giving much study material for the researcher into renaissance performance practice The book contains around 85 tablatures for fantasias songs and dances Most of the vocal pieces are in Italian The Neapolitan songs with their parallel fifths which not required in Italian text so it is a question here of a style marker have a more rustic character One of them Del crudamor has an almost Oriental character Various dances for solo lute also tend toward the rustic 

The ensemble pieces have been recorded by the Dowland Consort of Lutes and by the Liuto Concertato

Kamakura jubango
The Kamakura jubango tengame match was a historically significant go match played in Japan in 1939 1940 and 1941 It pitted Kitani Minoru and Go Seigen close rivals for a decade and friends at a personal level and both ranked 7 dan against each other

Go Seigen emerged victorious by a 64 margin This match marked the beginning of the period of his dominance as the top player which continued until the First Meijin Tournament in 1962

Nine months before the match started Kitani had defeated Honinbo Shusai the Meijin in Shusais retirement game The Honinbo title was to be open to competition and both Kitani and Go took part in that tournament Each failed to get through to the final match which was contested by Sekiyama Riichi and Shin Kato with Sekiyama becoming the first Honinbo under the titleholder system in 1941 The preliminaries of this first Honinbo tournament were under way during the Kamakura match With wartime conditions the pace of all competitions slowed considerably All these players also took part in the Oteai competition The first 9 dan to emerge from the Oteai was Fujisawa Kuranosuke some years later at this time 6 dan At the time it was hard to receive promotion even to 8 dan The pool of top players was rather small Karigane Junichi was 8 dan but had stayed outside the system that had established itself around Shusai and the Nihon Kiin

The result of the match was the first step in the process by which Go Seigen would establish ascendancy over his rivals except Sekiyama who withdrew from competition because of bad health He was promoted to 8 dan in spring 1942 Having taken on Kitani against whom he had an unfinished jubango stopped at 33 in 1933 when Kitani was promoted Go took on both Karigane and Fujisawa whom he played in the end in three long matches and then the new Honinbos Hashimoto Utaro and Iwamoto Kaoru Go Seigen played again in the Honinbo tournament but not after 1945 In later years various challenges allowed him to face the Honinbo of the time

Apart from game 2 played in Shiba Park in Tokyo and game 5 played in Gunma Prefecture the match was held in various locations actually in Kamakura The first game was in the Buddhist temple Kenchji Game 3 was in Engakuji as were games 4 6 and 9 The games 7 8 and 10 were in the Hachiman Shinto shrine in Kamakura

The starting conditions of the match were tagaisen since the players were of equal rank colours alternated with Kitani winning the nigiri There was no komidashi Largely unexpectedly Kitani went 15 down over the first six games and so was subject to beating down The final four games beginning 29 December 1940 were therefore played at senaisen with Kitani taking Black twice White then Black Of those final games Go Seigen could win only the second so that with a net score of 46 and a win with White Kitani had salvaged some of his reputation

All ten games are masterpieces with both players showing great spirit

The match was sponsored by the Yomiuri Shimbun

Shakujii Castle
Shakujii castle  j was a Japanese castle along the Shakujii River in what is now Shakujii Park in Tokyos Nerima The history of the inheritance of the feudal territory associated with it is the most clearly known of all territories in what is today Tokyo

The castle was strategically placed along the Shakujii River near Sanbtera Pond to control and defend the river valley Though there may have been another similar fortification erected nearby during the Heian period 7941185 it is likely that the last incarnation of Shakujii castle was first built after the Kamakura period 11851333 A dam was built around the same time a short distance from the castle at a spot selected by a diviner to block the waterway

The castle lasted into the Muromachi period 13361467 and was controlled by the Toshima clan They supported by Kanrei Shguns deputy Ashikaga Mochiuji were in their prime during the rebellion of Uesugi Zensh which lasted from 1415 to 1417

However roughly 40 years later the Toshima took part in the 1477 Kytoku Rebellion supporting the uprising of Nagao Kageharu Toshima Yasutsune led the forces of Shakujii castle and nearby Nerima castle to reinforce his brother Toshima Yasuaki who was attacked at Hiratsuka castle They were defeated by the army of ta Dkan a vassal of the Uesugi clan who put down the rebellion The Toshima then fled to Kozukue Castle They were defeated there as well and Shakujii castle was destroyed a short time later

Recently attempts have been made to restore the castle However there is very little remaining above ground Based on what digging has revealed it has been difficult to determine the exact location size and extent of the fortifications and the moat

Wincrest Nursing Home fire
The Wincrest Nursing Home fire took place on Friday January 30 1976 in Chicago United States The fire occurred when an arsonist set a wardrobe closet on fire at the Wincrest Nursing Home building located at 6326 N Winthrop Avenue The alarm sounded at 1130am and the fire was put out at 130pm Although the building itself sustained minor smoke fire and water damage 23 people died from smoke inhalation A 21yearold housekeeper was arrested by authorities and was charged with multiple counts of arson

The fire was described as the worst of its kind in Chicagos history and caused the Board of Health to enact changes

In its design plan the building complex consisted of 28 rooms which could accommodate 88 residents The original brick building was demolished in 1966 as part of a threestage construction project and was replaced by a three story building and a garden The complex was finally completed in 1973

The original nursing home complex was a 1906sqft177m brick building consisting of two floors In 1959 a second building was added to the rear which includes a garden The addition increased the size of the complex to 5179sqft481m The addition was built with precast concrete floor and roof slabs connected to steel beams and columns In 1966 the brick building was removed and was replaced by a three story building at the same time a third floor was added to the original building constructed in 1959 Overall the second addition expanded the complex to 9466sqft879m In 1973 a third building was added with a 10ft3m corridor connecting to the existing building complex The third building also consisted of three floors and had a floor area of 3613sqft336m The construction of the third building consisted of precast concrete floor slabs metal roof deck on steel bar joists All of the buildings were covered with a 58inch fire rated plasterboard

After the entire complex was finished in 1973 it had nursing area lounges and a small kitchen with no cooking appliances closets and bathrooms on the all three floors The complex also had a laundry room boiler room storage room and chapel lounge which is located in the third building of the complex

In the design plan the nursing home complex only had two stairways The first stairways are located in the first building near the lobby area and the second stairway is located in the second building Both stairways had doors that have wire mesh windows and are operated by hydraulic door closers The complex also had only one elevator which also located in the first building across from the lobby stairway The exterior walls of the building consisted of brick and concrete blocks surrounded by gypsum board The interior walls also consistent of gypsum with the outer wall finish consisting of paint wallpaper ceramic tile and vinyl Overall the entire structural system of the building complex consisted of a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slabs up to thick All of the floor slabs are supported by fire resistant columns and beams

All of the patient rooms lounge areas and chapel on all three floors are had a natural ventilation system ie open windows The restroom area enclosed garden area nurses offices and other rooms in the building complex were ventilated by heater air conditioner and ceiling fans All of the buildings electrical system were composed of system II required emergency exit signs and corridor lighting system The system operated an automatic transfer switch which operates the emergency lights in case of power failure The third floor of the building complex had battery powered emergency lighting

The nursing home was equipped with a manual and automatic fire alarm system that is connected directly to the fire alarm office of the Chicago Fire Department The alarm system was designed to give out a code or box number of the alarm station when activated The manual fire alarm system consisted of two pull fire alarm boxes located on each floor and one fire alarm box located at the entrance of the building The automatic fire alarms are activated by heat sensors which are located on the third floor both stairways and in the storage closet The automatic fire alarm system also consisted of smoke detectors On the third floor three fire extinguishers and two public address loud speakers were installed

The Wincrest Nursing Home was inspected by three departments health building and fire on a monthly basis The last inspection occurred on January 8 1976 21 days before the fire All inspections showed no code or health violations

At the time of the fire the building was occupied by 83 residents three nurses 2 aides and eleven office kitchen and maintenance staff 28 of the residents were in the chapel room on the third floor of the building

Fire was reported in room 306 by a nurses aide who pulled the fire alarm box The alarm was received by the Chicago Fire Department at 1143 AM CDT Attempts to put out the fire by staff proved to no avail The first fire engine arrived at the scene of the fire 3 minutes and 40 seconds later as nursing home staff evacuated the burning building More fire engines arrived seconds later as smoke was seen rising from the top of the building At 1146 AM firefighters fighting the fire discovered the third floor heavily laden with smoke and trapped elderly patients in wheelchairs The victims were immediately removed from the burning building and were transported to nearby hospitals

The fire was put out at 128pm CDT The room where the fire broke out was completely gutted and the adjacent corridor sustained only moderate smoke and heat damage Three other rooms also suffered heat and smoke damage No smoke damage was evident on the second or first floors and water damage was minor However despite the minor damage to the building 23 fatalities were reported due to smoke inhalation

An investigation made by the Chicago Police Department and fire department The survivors claimed that the fire was started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time Although the actual cause of the fire was unknown the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson It is unclear however how the authorities determined that the fire was an act of arson and the arsonists motives for starting the fire were never noted

The investigation also indicated that the smoke and heat from the fire raced down the corridor and entered rooms where doors were left open In addition a window was left open reducing the amount of smoke and toxic gas entering the chapel area and the lounge room thus preventing further fatalities Investigators also cited the difficulty of moving elderly patients in wheelchairs to the nearby stairway and the inability of elderly patients of evacuating themselves from the third floor where the fire took place

The City of Chicago and the Board of Health made several safety improvements after the fire These improvements include

HMS Amazon 1795
HMS Amazon was a 36gun frigate built at Rotherhithe by John and William Wells  Co in 1795 to a design by Sir William Rule Carrying a main battery of 18pounder long guns she was the first of a class of four frigates She spent her entire career in The Channel part of the Inshore Squadron under Sir Edward Pellew She was wrecked in Audierne Bay in 1797 following an engagement with the French shipoftheline Droits de lHomme

Amazon was one of four 36gun 18pound Amazonclass frigates built to a design by William Rule She and her sister ship  were ordered on 24 May 1794 Built to the same dimensions they were along the gun deck with a beam of and a depth in the hold of  They were 933 tons burthen a piece

Work began in June at Rotherhithe by Wells  Co when the keel was laid down Launched on 4 July 1795 Amazon was taken to Deptford where she was completed from 3  25 September Including fitting her construction had cost 24681

Amazon was built to carry a main battery of twentysix on her upper gun deck eight on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle She additionally carried ten carronades six on the quarter deck and two on the forecastle When fully manned she had a complement of 264

In 1795 while under the command of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds she was part of the Inshore Squadron under Sir Edward Pellew watching the French port of Brest to report any attempt by the French fleet to leave port Pellews force comprised the 44gun ships and  the 38gun frigate  Amazon and a second 36gun frigate  Cruising off Ushant late in the afternoon of 13 April 1796 a ship was seen to windward Pellew ordered Rvolutionnaire to sail an intercepting course while the rest of the squadron gave chase Rvolutionnaire eventually cut off the quarry which turned out to be the French frigate Unit and after a brief exchange of fire forced her to surrender A week later on 20 April Amazon was again in pursuit of an enemy frigate With Argo in Plymouth and Rvolutionnaire on her way home with her prize the three remaining British frigates were lyingto off The Lizard when 40gun Virginie was spotted Indefatigable being the best sailer was first to engage after a chase lasting 15 hours When Amazon and Concorde caught up the French ship surrendered Then on 13 June Amazon contributed to the capture of the 16gun Betsy and the 14gun Les Trois Couleurs off Brest

On 11 December 1796 Amazon was despatched with news that seven French ships of the line had arrived in Brest This was part of the preparation for an invasion of Ireland The French fleet left harbour and evaded the main British blockade fleet and sailed for Bantry Bay However storms scattered them and most returned to France having accomplished very little

In the Action of 13 January 1797 Amazon in company with Pellews ship Indefatigable encountered the French ship Droits de lHomme a 74gun ship of the line Normally frigates would not engage a ship of the line as they would be severely outgunned However there was a heavy sea and the French ship could not open her lower deck gunports for fear of flooding This reduced her broadside considerably 

Pellew was seven miles ahead of Amazon when he first attacked the Droits de lHomme An hour and a half later Amazon came up and poured a broadside into the Frenchmans quarter The two frigates attacked her from either side yawing to rake her while avoiding much of her return fire At 420 am on 14 January land was suddenly sighted ahead and the frigates broke off the attack and headed in opposite directions Amazon going north and more severely damaged was unable to wear and ran aground at Audierne Bay Isle Bas Three crew had been killed during the battle and six more drowned but the rest were able to reach shore There the French captured them The heavy seas pounding her on the beach destroyed Amazon the Droits de lHomme badly damaged in the battle was also wrecked with heavy casualties 

The court martial on 29 September 1797 routinely held by the Navy after the loss of any vessel honourably acquitted Captain Reynolds and his officers of negligence in the loss of the ship

Alfred A Tomatis
Alfred A Tomatis 1 January 1920  25 December 2001 was a French otolaryngologist and inventor He received his Doctorate in Medicine from the Paris School of Medicine His alternative medicine theories of hearing and listening are known as the Tomatis method or AudioPsychoPhonology APP

Tomatis approach began as an effort to help professional singers in his native Nice based on his idea that errant hearing is the root cause of a variety of ailments His Listening Test and later his Electronic Ear therapy were designed to alleviate these problems

Alfred Tomatis grew up in a musical family in France His father was an opera singer and he spent much of his childhood traveling with him and watching his opera performances from the wings At an early age however he and his parents decided he was not fit for the stage So he went into medicine and eventually became an Ear Nose and Throat physician

Soon after he began his practice his father began referring him opera colleagues with vocal problems Tomatis soon discovered traditional treatments inadequate but also that there was very little research on the voice itself He formulated the theory that many vocal problems were really hearing problems His theory that the voice does not produce what the ear does not hear is the hallmark of his research and his method He discovered that the voices of opera singers had damaged their own muscles of the middle ears With damaged hearing they were forcing their voices to produce sounds in registers they could no longer hear

In his attempt to retrain his patients he developed the Electronic Ear a device which utilizes electronic gating bone conduction transducers and sound filters to enhance the uppermost missing frequencies The goal is to tonify the muscles of the middle ear in order to sensitize the listener to the missing frequencies

Tomatis began treating a number of other problems with the same methods including reading problems dyslexia depression severe schizophrenia and even autism He found evidence that many of these problems result from a failure of communication which has to do with listening and the ear

Scientific reports showed that the ear starts forming a few days after conception and that the ear is fully developed by the fourth month of pregnancy Tomatis theorized that information coming from the fetal ear stimulates and guides the development of the brain He believed that a number of auditory communication problems begin in pregnancy with the fetus not properly responding to the voice of the mother Tomatis theorized that the whole body is involved in the production of speech and language He stated that reading even silent reading is an activity of the ear He recommended reading out loud not only for children and by children but also by adults for 30 minutes a day He claimed this not only stimulates the brain but is the best way to learn

His most controversial method attempts to lead autistic children to recognize and respond to their mothers voice The electronic ear he maintained could simulate the sound of the mothers voice as heard in the uterus and to lead the child gradually to accept and respond to her real unfiltered voice He reported that this method often brought startling results with children crying with joy as they recognized their mothers voice for the first time

In many of the differing issues he addressed Tomatis believed that many problems of learning disabilities dyslexia schizophrenia and depression were caused by some trauma resulting from broken relationships and poor communication He found that treatment of these maladies requires the cooperation of the parents and even grandparents

In his autobiography Tomatis recounts the many runins he had with the medical establishment in both France and Canada where he later worked Eventually he left the orthodox medical community admitting that his practice was beyond the scope of normative allopathic comprehension He named his new field audiopsychophonology

Tomatis reported in his autobiography that he regretted not providing scientific colleagues with more statistical evidence for his work along with his many publications but he claimed that the benefits of his methods are difficult to measure

Due to the lack of scientific basis and the wide range of diseases it claimed to treat French authorities have always considered Tomatis sound therapy as an alternative medicine which should not be promoted

The results of a scientific study published in 2008
reflect a lack of improvement in language using the Tomatis Method for children with autism However in 2010 Jan Gerittsen
conducted a detailed case analysis of Corbets reported findings on children on the Autism Spectrum Disorder Gerittsen showed that for this particular research an individual case study design would have been the more appropriate research design method His individual case study analysis captured with higher fidelity the effect of Tomatis Method in each of the participants Given individual differences of children on the Autism Spectrum a group design study could omit to address the significant improvements which Gerittsen noted occurred in 60  of the participants in the areas of language daily living skills social interaction and motor skills

Tim Gilmors metaanalysis covering four smaller studies of the Tomatis method found that Positive effects sizes were found for each of the five behavioral domains analyzed These study results although positive are limited by major methodological issues such as small sample sizes and limited use of random assignment

Gerittsen summarized 35 reteach studies documenting effects of the Tomatis Listening Method in a variety of cognitive developmental  behavioral and aptitude domains These include studies on children and adults with learning and developmental disabilities including auditory processing issues as well as applications for optimizing wellbeing and aptitude in musicians

In 2013 Liliana Sacarin found significant early effects after only 30 hours of Tomatis sound stimulation in children 713 of age diagnosed with ADHD when using standardized measures of performance observed behavior and brain electrophysiology The results of her doctoral dissertation evidenced statistically significant improvements in cognitive attentional and behavioral measures for the Tomatis group when compared to the controls nonTomatis group The Sacarin study reported that the qEEG group analysis resulted in significant brain electrophysiology changes for the Tomatis group but not for the controls

Despite criticisms of Audio Processing Integration in general and the Tomatis Method in particular some of those treated notably Grard Depardieu Sting and Maria Callas maintain that they experienced highly beneficial results from working with Tomatis and his method

In some websites it is reported that in the years 20052007 the Ministry of Education in Poland had implemented the Tomatis Method in hundreds of schools with financial support of a programme initiated by the European Union recommended and scientifically accompanied by the Instytut Fizjologii i Patologii Suchu Warszawa Institute for the Physiology and Pathology of the Ears Warsaw Research done in Poland 72 schools 1333 children proved that the training improved key school competences ability to learn social competences language competences music competences

Tomatis adapted his techniques to target diverse disorders including auditory processing problems dyslexia learning disabilities attention deficit disorders autism and sensory processing and motorskill difficulties It is also claimed to have helped adults fight depression learn foreign languages faster develop better communication skills and improve both creativity and onthejob performance About some musicians singers and actors it is also claimed they have said they had found it helpful for finetuning their tonal and harmonic skills

The Tomatis Method uses recordings by Mozart and Gregorian Chant as well as of the patients mothers voice Tomatis use of Mozart is not to be confused with socalled Mozart Effect popularized by American author and music researcher Don Campbell Although Tomatis coined the phrase his method is not directly related to claims that listening to Mozart increases intelligence

Tomatis wrote fourteen books and over two thousand articles His Ear and Language The Conscious Ear The Ear and the Voice and We are all Multilingual have been translated into English the latter by author David Charles Manners

John Anstis
John Anstis 29 August 1669  4 March 1744 was an English officer of arms antiquarian and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1702 and 1722 He rose to the highest heraldic office in England and became Garter King of Arms in 1718 after years of political manoeuvring

Anstis was born at St Neot Cornwall on 29 August 1669 He was the first son of another John Anstis and his wife Mary the daughter of George Smith Anstis matriculated at Exeter College Oxford on 27 March 1685 and entered the Middle Temple on 31 January 1690 On 23 June 1695 he married Elizabeth daughter and heir of Richard Cudlipp of Tavistock Devon They had eight sons and six daughters Anstis was called to the bar on 19 May 1699

In March 1701 Anstis received permission from the Earl Marshal Henry Howard 7th Duke of Norfolk to collect materials from the College of Arms library to assist in the defence of the jurisdiction of the Earl Marshal which was under attack Anstis was also elected to Parliament for St Germans in 1702 When the Garter King of Arms Sir Thomas St George died in March 1703 Anstis was in a position to advise Lady Howard on how to protect her sons rights from the threat of a royal nomination of a new Garter on the one hand and the assumption of the nomination by the deputy earl marshal Sir Henry St George was nominated to be Garter and succeeded his brother in June 1703

Anstis did not stand for election to Parliament in 1705 In May 1707 Anstis was nominated Carlisle Herald of Arms Extraordinary and Norfolk Herald This was part of a plan to persuade Garter St George to administer the office jointly with Anstis doing most of the work In spite of the nomination Anstis was never appointed to either post Anstiss main rival to succeed St George was now John Vanbrugh who had become Clarenceux King of Arms in March 1704 to strengthen his own claims to the office In December 1710 Anstis used a change in administration to try again at securing the Gartership On 20 January 1711 he was reelected to Parliament in a byelection as MP for St Mawes and was then elected as MP for Launceston at the 1713 general election He changed his strategy with St George He continued to secure offices related to public records for himself and he remained loyal to the Tory ministry in Parliament With his influential political friends Anstis was eventually able to obtain promise of an appointment to the office of Garter King of Arms on 2 April 1714

Anstis was returned again as MP for Launceston in the 1715 general election and held the seat until the 1722 By the time that Sir Henry St George finally died in August 1715 the political situation had shifted away from Anstiss political connections Vanbrugh was nominated to the office and took measures to secure the passage of his grant In addition on 30 September 1715 Anstis was arrested on suspicion of involvement in plotting a Jacobite uprising in Cornwall A protracted legal battle ensued as Anstis and Vanbrugh both claimed the title of Garter Anstis eventually emerged victorious in May 1718

In 1724 he obtained an order for publishing as editor and assisted by Elias Ashmole the Register of the Most Noble Order of the Garter From its Cover in Black Velvet Usually Called the Black Book which was printed at his own expense This was a transcript of the Latin Black Book of the Garter then the earliest surviving register of that order written in about 1535 now in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle In the preface to his work he wrote
While we with sensible regret complain of the loss of these old annals whereby we are deprived of a great treasure it hath been judged expedient to preserve the remains which have happily escaped this shipwreck And therefore the eldest register remaining in the archives is now exhibited to publick view less by the currency of time or any unforeseen accident it might be subject to the same unhappy fate The original manuscript is a very large pompous volume in folio written in an handsome strong character on vellom having the initial letters of each paragraph together with the names of the companions and of the knights nominated in scrutinies beautifully embellished with gold placed on squares of gold and azure alternatelyIt hath been shewn in the introduction when and by whom this register was compiled and from what materials it was collected

In the following year he interested Robert Walpole in a plan for a new order of chivalry based on a revival of the medieval Order of the Bath This led to his Observations Introductory to an Historical Essay on the Knighthood of the Bath is 1725 and to Anstiss drawing up the statutes for the new order

Anstis duly presided over the coronation of George II in 1727 In 1728 he embarked on extensive research to prove that his family was related to Archbishop Henry Chichele the founder of All Souls College Oxford This research would have entitled his son John Anstis to a fellowship at the college This was blocked by Archbishop William Wake although Anstis did have his son made Blanc Coursier Herald in 1727 In 1737 he secured the succession of his office of Garter to John

Anstis died on 4 March 1744 at Mortlake Surrey He was buried at Duloe in Cornwall on 23 March according to his wishes Anstis was an indefatigable antiquarian whose correspondence with fellow scholars such as Thomas Hearne and Humfrey Wanley testifies to his wide interests He left a mass of unpublished papers including over 8000 pages of notes on English history Jurisprudence Chronology Heraldry Ecclesiastical and Military Affairs Many of his papers were sold in 1768 and in 1774 and are now held in the British Library the Bodleian Library and All Souls Oxford

Alice Dayrell Caldeira Brant
Alice Dayrell Caldeira Brant August 28 1880  June 20 1970 was a Brazilian juvenile writer When she was a teenager she kept a diary which describes life in Diamantina Minas Gerais Brazil which was then published in 1942 The diary was published under a pen name Helena Morley When it was originally published it was in portuguese under the title  The diary was then translated in to English by Elizabeth Bishop in 1957

She was born in Diamantina Minas Gerais Brazil to an English father and a Brazilian mother Her father worked as a diamond miner The diary chronicles Brants daily life and covers her teenage years until 1895

In 1900 Brant married Augusto Mrio Calderia Brant they had five children together Brant says that she published her diaries in order to act as a role model for younger females who may read the book She wrote that the diary was a way to show young women what becoming an adult means and in this way she is acting like a grandmother to the reader One of her daughters Ignez Caldeira Brant married with Abgar Renault Ministry of Education Brazil 19551956 e do Tribunal de Contas da Unio 19671973

Brants only published work is The Diary of Helena Morley which she began writing when she attended the Normal School The diary discusses her daily life in the diamond mining town of Diamantina romantic interests but it also deals with heavier topics like loss The book also discusses relationships marriage in particular but also social affairs and Brants dreams The topics of the book make it so that it could be a diary of a present day teenager rather than one 60 years ago Since Brant discusses her everyday life insights about that point in history are able to be gained by reading the diary particularly about the effects of the abolition of slavery There is very little documentation about life post emancipation making the diary an important resource for historians Brant is praised for her ability to add humor to the discussion of racism which typically is associated with seriousness Another reason Brants book was so popular is the nostalgic that it brings the reader the provincial life of a small town that the reader is able to find peace in the description of the simple life

The book attracted attention like many other diaries of young women The prevalence of young female diaries is explained for many of the same reasons Brants own diary is popular That they allow the reader to feel young again and reminisce about when they were a teenager Some of the first attention that was drawn to Brant for her work was after Alexandre Eullio praised Brant for her work these praises placed Brant among classic Brazilian authors French author Georges Bernanos also made the public aware of the book Elizabeth Bishop was originally drawn to the work in 1952 then in 1957 Bishop published her English translation of the book Bishop says that she was drawn to Brants work because of Brants impressive skills of observation and ability to recreate a scene using only words Some have compared Brants work to Jane Austen that even though she was from a small town in Brazil its style is like work from England

George Anyona
George Moseti Anyona 19452003 was a politician from Kenya

When he was released from prison in 1992 many people thought he would join Jaramogi Oginga Odingas FORDKenya but he opted to go alone by forming his own political party the Kenya Social Congress KSC Though he easily won a seat in Parliament as had been anticipated his Kitutu Masaba constituents squarely rejected his bid for the presidency opting to vote for other candidates instead Anyonas name however remains dominant among Kenyas political personalities because he is perceived by a large section of Kenyans as a brave man who was strong enough to challenge the Kenya African National Union KANU government at a time when it was almost suicidal to do so

Anyona was born in 1945 in Tombe Village Kitutu Masaba Kenya

He attended Tombe Primary School and Sengera Intermediate School before proceeding to the prestigious Alliance High School From Alliance he proceeded to Makerere University Uganda where he studied Political Science English Economics and History Before he ventured into politics in 1974 he worked for British Airways in Nairobi

The same year he ventured into politics he won the then Kitutu East Parliamentary seat Anyonas political troubles began in 1977 when he was detained without trial by then President Jomo Kenyatta He was released a year later by President Daniel arap Moi soon after he assumed power following the death of President Kenyatta Anyona would again land in trouble in 1982 this time with his longtime friend and veteran politician Jaramogi Oginga Odinga The two were arrested and detained without trial for attempting to form a political party Kenya African Socialist Alliance KASA to challenge the ruling party KANU Shortly after they were detained KANU sensed the danger the two politicians had exposed and immediately sought to seal the loopholes in the constitution The result was the passing of a constitutional amendment making Kenya a de facto oneparty state the same year 
Anyona was released from detention in 1984 and for the rest of the 1980s shied away from active politics His political comeback came in 1990 during the clamour for multiparty democracy in Kenya To many Kenyans this was one battle Anyona and Jaramogi could not shy away from because they were the ones who started it in 1982 Shortly after he reentered Kenyan politics in 1990 Anyona was again arrested at a Nairobi pub and charged with sedition Others arrested with him included Professor Edward Oyugi Isiah Ngotho Kariuki and Augustus Njeru Kathangu After a marathon trial they were jailed for seven years on charges of scheming to overthrow the Kenyan government and being in possession of seditious and proscribed publications According to some documents presented in the trial it was alleged that Anyona had gone as far as preparing a shadow cabinet to take over after he overthrew the government However it was later revealed by an Assistant Minister in the Office of the President John Keen that these allegations were nothing but government fabrications aimed at silencing Anyona In 1992 after filing appeals against their sentences the four were released on bail Shortly after that they were freed when the state opted not to oppose their appeals

With the multiparty elections coming up in December 1992 all opposition parties hoped Anyona would give them his endorsement FORDKenya in particular then under Jaramogi Oginga Odinga was seen as Anyonas perfect destination He was elected the FORDKenya Nyamira District Branch Chairman in absentia In a surprising move however Anyona rejected FORDKenyas overtures opting instead to launch his own political party Kenya Social Congress and vying for the Presidency In the 1992 MultiParty General Elections he won easily the Kitutu Masaba Constituency parliamentary seat becoming the only member of parliament from the KSC Though his constituents expressed eagerness to send Anyona to parliament they were not nearly as eager to vote for him as a Presidential candidate

Anyona died in 2003 in a car crash in the outskirts of Nairobi

Solomon and Sheba
Solomon and Sheba is a 1959 American epic historical romance film directed by King Vidor shot in Technirama color by Technicolor and distributed by United Artists The film dramatizes events described in The Biblethe tenth chapter of the First Kings and the ninth chapter of Second Chronicles

It starred Yul Brynner as Solomon and Gina Lollobrigida as Sheba and features George Sanders as Adonijah Marisa Pavan as Abishag and David Farrar as the Pharaoh The screenplay by Anthony Veiller Paul Dudley and George Bruce was based on a story by Crane Wilbur

The films theme differs substantially from Biblical sources and is highly fictionalized most notably in representing the Queen of Sheba as an ally of ancient Egypt in opposition to King Solomon of Israel and in her having a love affair with Solomon

Under the rule of King David Israel is united and prosperous although surrounded by enemies including Egypt and its allies The ageing King favours Solomon to succeed him but his elder brother Adonijah George Sanders a warrior declares himself King When David learns of this he publicly announces Solomon to be his successor Adonijah and Joab his general withdraw in rage but Solomon later offers his brother the command of the army knowing that Adonijah may use it against him

Israel continues to prosper under Solomons rule The Queen of Sheba Gina Lollobrigida conspires with the Egyptian Pharaoh to undermine Solomons rule by seducing him and introducing Sheban pagan worship into Jerusalem Solomon is indeed bewitched by her and the two begin living together under the pretense of forming an alliance between their two kingdoms The kings reputation is damaged but at the same time Shebawho sees the kings wisdom in the Judgment of Solomonbegins to truly fall in love with him and regret her plotting Things come to a head when Solomon recklessly allows a Sheban love festival in fact an orgy in celebration of a pagan god to be held within Israel In an act of divine retribution lightning from heaven destroys the Sheban altar and damages the newly built Temple in Jerusalem and the land is beset with a deadly famine Solomon is publicly rebuked by the people the High Priest and Nathan the Prophet disown him

Meanwhile Adonijah banished by his brother after an assassination attempt goes and strikes a bargain with Pharaoh given an army he will conquer Israel for Egypt in exchange for being placed on the throne as a kind of viceroy The tiny army mustered by Solomon who has been abandoned by his allied states is quickly routed and Adonijah presses on to Jerusalem and makes himself king Meanwhile Sheba now a believer in the power of the God of Israel prays for Solomon to be redeemed and restored to power as Nathan the Prophet overhears

Pursued by the Egyptians who were sent to finish him off Solomon thereafter devises a plan He lines up the remnants of his army on a hill prompting the enemy to charge The Israelites who have arranged themselves to face east then use their highly polished shields to reflect the light of the rising sun into the Egyptians eyes Blinded the Egyptians are prevented from seeing the chasm in front of which the Israelites have positioned themselves and the entire army rushes headlong over the edge and falls to its death

Meanwhile Adonijah met with a tepid reaction to his coup tries to stir up Jerusalems population by ordering the stoning of Sheba Midway through this hideous display Solomon makes a triumphant return to the city Adonijah attacks his brother refusing to be deprived again of his throne but is himself struck down Joab in retaliation attempts to attack Solomon but is struck down by Solomons faithful retainers Josiah and Ahab At Solomons prayer Sheba is miraculously healed of her wounds as he resumes his power she returns to her homeland now pregnant by Solomon


Edward Small announced plans to make a film about King Solomon as early as 1953 The following year Julius Epstein was writing a script for Small which was going to be produced by the team of Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse who often made movies under Smalls supervision Small then announced he was developing the project with Arthur Hornblow Jr and in 1955 Gina Lollobrigida was signed United Artists agreed to distribute the following year Small provided 75 of the films anticipated 6 million budget with United Artists provided 25

Lollobrigida came on board as financial partner getting a percentage of the profits The role of Solomon had been turned down by Tyrone Power and Yul Brynner however Power agreed to accept the part after the script was rewritten

Powers involvement meant the film became a coproduction with Powers Copa Productions headed by Ted Richmond In the interim Small and Hornblow had made Witness for the Prosecution together which was a hit but they decided to end their partnership Small went into coproduction with Copa Productions with Hornblow retaining a financial interest

The film was shot in Madrid and Valdespartera Zaragoza Spain Production began on 15 September 1958 aiming for a midDecember finish

Two thirds of the movie had been shot and the unit was in Madrid when on 15 November Tyrone Power filmed a duel scene with George Sanders who played his brother The two had also filmed a sword fight in the 1942 film The Black Swan The duel had to be repeated several times Power finally dropped the sword and said he couldnt continue complaining of a pain in his left arm He was helped to his dressing room and given brandy It is unclear what happened next as stories differ In one scenario he was taken to the hospital in Gina Lollabrigidas car and died Another scenario is that Power died in his dressing room In order to keep his jaw from dropping a scarf was put around his neck to walk him out of the studio to the car This was done in part because Mrs Power was at the hotel and knew nothing about what happened Ted Richmond gave orders that no press was to be called and Mrs Power was not to be called He died en route to the hospital Mrs Power was escorted to the hospital A memorial service was held on 16 November at US Torrejon Air Force Base

Production of the movie was halted Because love scenes remained to be shot another actor would have to be cast if the existing script was to be used battle sequences had been filmed but most of these could still be used with close ups of the new actor added Other possibilities discussed including rewriting the script to use Powers footage or use Power for the first half of the movie as young Solomon then recasting another actor as Solomon for the second half The issue was complicated by the fact that three different parties had full script star and director approval Small Copa Productions and Gina Lollobrigida

On 16 November Small offered the part of Solomon to Yul Brynner a friend of Power and the actor accepted This meant Brynner had to delay playing the lead role in Spartacus to which he had committed However United Artists had not been told of Brynners casting and were unsure of the conditions which had been granted to him Ted Richmond wanted to pull out of producing and for a time there was some doubt if the film would go ahead at all

Another option was to cancel Solomon and Sheba altogether the production was insured up to 3 million in the case of the death of one of the six lead players Lloyds of London covered the daily 100000 bill while the film was halted However in the end it was decided to proceed with Brynner in the role of Solomon

The film was eventually completed over ten weeks after much difficulty with an estimated cost of 6 million It was felt that this was relatively inexpensive considering the scale of the movie and Spain increasingly became a basis for Hollywood movies

The film is probably most noted for an orgy scene albeit no nudity featuring Sheba Lollobrigida see the lobby card which was extremely licentious for Hollywood motion pictures of that era

Solomon and Sheba received its world premiere on 27 October 1959 at the Astoria Theatre Charing Cross Road London where it was presented in 70mm

Solomon and Sheba received indifferent to negative reviews and Yul Brynners performance was criticized by no less than the films director King Vidor who stated that Tyrone Power had been much more believable as a conflicted king than Brynner who apparently played it with too much selfassurance Variety however praised some of the films sequences as magnificent production scenes and described Lollobrigida as showing the queen to be a woman of sharp brain as well as sensual beauty The magazine also stated that Brynner does a fine job in presenting a Solomon who credibly suggests a singer of songs yet finally is a man of ordinary flesh and blood who cannot resist Sheba

The film was a box office success earning an estimated 55 million in North American rentals with a total gross of 122 million

Commutative magma
In mathematics there exist magmas that are commutative but not associative A simple example of such a magma may be derived from the childrens game of rock paper scissors Such magmas give rise to nonassociative algebras

Let formula1  standing for the rock paper and scissors gestures respectively and consider the binary operation formula2 derived from the rules of the game as follows

This results in the Cayley table

By definition the magma formula13 is commutative but it is also nonassociative as shown by

but

ie

The mean operation formula17 on the rational numbers or any commutative number system closed under division is also commutative but not in general associative eg

but

Generally the mean operations studied in topology need not be associative

The construction applied in the previous section to rockpaperscissors applies readily to variants of the game with other numbers of gestures as described in the section Variations as long as there are two players and the conditions are symmetric between them more abstractly it may be applied to any trichotomous binary relation like beats in the game The resulting magma will be associative if the relation is transitive and hence is a strict total order
otherwise if finite it contains directed cycles like rockpaperscissorsrock and the magma is nonassociative To see the latter consider combining all the elements in a cycle in reverse order ie so that each element combined beats the previous one
the result is the last element combined while associativity and commutativity would mean that the result only depended on the set of elements in the cycle

The bottom row in the Karnaugh diagram above gives more example operations defined on the integers or any commutative ring

Using the rockpaperscissors example one can construct a commutative nonassociative algebra over a field formula20 take formula21 to be the threedimensional vector space over formula20 whose elements are written in the form

for formula24 Vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined componentwise and vectors are multiplied using the above rules for multiplying the elements formula25
The set

forms a basis for the algebra formula21 As before vector multiplication in formula21 is commutative but not associative

The same procedure may be used to derive from any commutative magma formula30 a commutative algebra over formula20 on formula32 which will be nonassociative if formula30 is

Shortly after being awarded the contract for the current Spirit of Gosport in 2001 Abels Shipbuilders were awarded a followon contract for a second ferry which was to be known as Spirit of Portsmouth However this vessel was only partially constructed when the ferry company cancelled the order and the unfinished hull remained at Abels shipyard for many years before being completed as a medical missionary ship the Forth Hope

The need for a second vessel to run alongside the similar Spirit of Gosport still existed and the current Spirit of Portsmouth was built in 2005 She is primarily used for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent thus enabled Spirit of Gosport to replace Portsmouth Queen on the Gosport to Portsmouth ferry route The main difference between the two Spirit of vessels is the covered roof and bar on Spirit of Portsmouth making her more suited to cruising Spirit of Portsmouth however services the ferry route when either Spirit of Gosport or the other ferry Harbour Spirit are out of service

Upon the introduction of Spirit of Portsmouth the 1966built Portsmouth Queen was withdrawn from service The previous vessel that was dedicated to cruise duty was Solent Enterprise Spirit of Portsmouth is currently the Gosport Ferries flagship

Manimahesh Lake
Manimahesh Lake also known as Dal Lake Manimahesh is a high altitude lake elevation  situated close to the Manimahesh Kailash Peak in the Pir Panjal Range of the Himalayas in the Bharmour subdivision of Chamba district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh The religious significance of this lake is next to that of the Lake Manasarovar in Tibet
The lake is the venue of a highly revered pilgrimage trek undertaken during the month of AugustSeptember corresponding to the month of Bhadon according to Hindu calendar on the eighth day of the New Moon period It is known as the Manimahesh Yatra The Government of Himachal Pradesh has declared it as a statelevel pilgrimage

There are two trekking routes to the lake One is from Hadsar village that is mostly frequented by pilgrims and trekkers This route is easier and have adequate arrangement for basic food and accommodation during the pilgrimage season The other one is from village Holi which is for the more adventurous ones This route climbs up further and then descends to the lake providing a beautiful view There is no other habitation except for a small village on this route

According to one popular legend it is believed that Lord Shiva created Manimahesh after he married Goddess Parvati who is worshipped as Mata Girija There are many legends narrated linking Lord Shiva and his show of displeasure through acts of avalanches and blizzards that occur in the region

Legend also mentions that Shiva performed penance on the banks of Manimahesh Lake In the same vein it is mentioned that Gaddis Shepherd the tribes of this region adopted Lord Shiva as their deity Gaddis are the people who reside in the Gaddi Valley which is the name of the upper regions of Ravi River where the Mount Chamba Kailash lies Further according to the legend the Shiva who lived in Mount Kailash the highest mountain of the state gifted the Gaddis with a Chuhali topi pointed cap which they wear traditionally along with their other dress of chola coat and dora a long black cord about 1015 m long The Gaddis started calling the land of this mountainous region as Shiv Bhumi Land of Shiva and themselves as devotees of Shiva The legend further states that before Shiva married Parvati at Lake Manasarovar and became the universal parents of the universe Shiva created the Mount Kailash in Himachal Pradesh and made it his abode He made Gaddis his devotees The land where Gaddis lived extended from west of Bharmaur upstream of the confluence of Budhil and Ravi rivers up to Manimahesh Manimahesh was also considered the abode of the three Lords of the universe namely Shiva Vishnu and Brahma Manimahesh was reckoned as the heaven Kaliasa of Lord Shiva The waterfall seen at the Dhancho on the way to Manimahesh Lake and which emanates from the lake was considered as the heaven Vaikunta of Vishnu The heaven of Bramha is cited as a mound overlooking the Bharmaur city The Gaddis also believe that Shiva resides in the Mount Kailash for six months whereafter he moves to the netherworld handing over the reigns to Lord Vishnu The day he departs to the netherworld is observed by the Gaddis reverentially every year which is the Janmashtami day the eighth day of the month of Bhadon August the birthday of Lord Krishna an incarnation of Lord Vishnu Shiva returned from the netherworld to Bharamaur at the end of February before the night of his wedding and this day is observed as the Shivratri day Gaddis observe this also as a festive day since Shiva and Parvati returned to Mount Kailash in the Gaddi land

Etymology of Manimahesh signifies a jewel Mani on Lord Shivas Maheshs crown According to a local legend the moonrays reflected from the jewel can be seen from Manimahesh Lake on clear full moon night which is a rare occasion However it has been inferred that such a phenomenon could be the result of reflection of light from the glacier that embellishes the peak in the form of a serpent around Shivas neck

A legend in which Lord Shiva himself is tricked is narrated According to this narration linked to Dhancho where pilgrims spend a night on their way to Manimahesh Lake Lord Shiva pleased with the devotion of one of his ardent devotees Bhasmasur an asura or demon bestowed a boon which gave powers to Bhasmasur under which Bhasmasur touching anyone would reduce that person to ashes Bhasmasur wanted to try this boon on Shiva himself He therefore followed Shiva to touch him and get rid of him However Shiva managed to escape and enter into the waterfall at Dhancho and take shelter in a cave behind the rolling waters of the fall Bhasmasur could not get through the waterfall Then Lord Vishnu intervened and killed Bhasamasur Since then the fall is considered holy

A rare event of the first suns rays falling on the Mani Mahesh peak is seen in reflection in the lake like saffron tilak This display in the lake has enhanced the legendary belief of the Gaddis on the sanctity of Manimahesh Lake at the base of the Mount Kailash which they visit on an annual pilgrimage This event has also contributed to the practice of taking bath in the lake on Janmashtami day or Radhashtami day fifteen days after the birth of Lord Krishna

The lake of glacial origin is in the upper reaches of the Ghoi nalarefer Leomann mapsIndia Himalaya Map 4 which is tributary of Budhil river a tributary of the Ravi River in Himachal Pradesh However the lake is the source of a tributary of the Budhil River known as Manimahesh Ganga The stream originates from the lake in the form of a fall at Dhancho The mountain peak is a snow clad tribal glen of Brahamur in the Chamba district of manimahesh range The highest peak is the Mani Mahesh Kailas also called Chamba Kailash elevation  overlooking the lake The lake considered a glacial depression is sourced by snowmelt waters from the surrounding hill slopes Towards the end of June with ice beginning to melt numerous small streams break up everywhere which together with the lush green hills and the myriad of flowers give the place a truly remarkable view The snow field at the base of the mountain is called by the local people as Shivas Chaugan Shivas playground According to a belief Lord Shiva stayed here with his consort Parvati

Manimahesh is approached from three routes Pilgrims from Lahaul and Spiti pass through Kugti pass Pilgrims from Kangra and Mandi take the Karwarsi pass or Jalsu pass via Tyari village near Holi in Bharmour The easiest and popular route is from Chamba via Bharmour The most popular is the BhanrlourHadsarManimahesh route which involves a track from Hadsar village to the Manimahesh Lake The highest altitude touched in this route is and it takes two days with an overnight stay at Dhancho Season to be undertaken is June to October and it has a gentle grade The path leading to the lake is well maintained

Halfway up this track is of open and flat meadow land to Dhancho Tented accommodation is available here during AugustSeptember Night halt is preferred here Free kitchens are opened by people to feed pilgrims But many prefer to go and pitch their tents next to the lake to feel a divine experience En route there is waterfall at Gauri Nallah known as the Dhancho fall From Dhancho it is a steep climb This track has seen lot of improvements over the years In the past the first climb was first done by crossing Dhancho nalla It was so tough that people used to crawl to get across Since they used to crawl like a monkey in this stretch it was known as Bandar Ghati monkey valley Now this track is much improved and the newly constructed path is used However some still prefer to take the old route as an adventure and go through the Bandar Ghati

In the past on the trek from Dhancho the bridge over the Mani Mahesh river was crossed to reach the left bank of the valley After  the river was again crossed over another wooden bridge to the right bank

From this point the climb passes through many zigzag paths along flowered meadows Birch trees are seen in the vicinity which indicates a gain in altitude as the trek proceeds Along this stretch of the trek route there are a number community kitchens eateries at about elevation From this location the trail to Mani Mahesh Lake could be discerned The waterfall flowing from the lake is also seen at this stage A further trek of through the grassy ridges leads to the Manimahesh Lake

Even though the Manimahesh Lake is of small size with shallow depth its location directly below Manimahesh Kailas peak and several other peaks and dangling glaciers is an inspiration even to the least devout pilgrim

Trekking in the last reach is through the glacier fields of the lake However on the way the walk is through the valley of flowers and wild medicinal herbs up to the lake The lake is situated at the centre of a snowy field touching the sacred peak The lake is surrounded by sandy boulders small hilly mounds and prickly dry bushes and there is no sign of any grass It is called Shiv Chaugan play ground of Lord Shiva The lake appears as if it has penetrated the rugged valley On a clear day the reflection of the abode of Shiva the Kailash Mountain can be seen on the lake surface All the year round the place remains desolate without any inhabitants because none dares to stay here The air is fresh but icy cold There are almost no fauna in the lake at its precincts  no ants snakes or any kind of wild life A few Bird species are sighted rarely The silence of the place is broken only when the pilgrims visit the place in large numbers an evening before the holy dip locally known as naun in the lake

According to legend Lord Shiva performed penance for several hundred years here The water cascades sprang out from his matted hair and took the form of the lake The lake as formed appears like a saucer It has two distinct parts The larger part has icy cold water called the Shiv Karotri the bathing place of Lord Shiva The smaller part of the lake which is hidden by the bushes has lukewarm water and is called Gauri Kund the bathing place of Parvati Shivas consort Thus men and women bathe in different parts of the lake According to rites the dip called locally as naun in the lake is taken four times if permitted or otherwise only once

In the periphery of the lake now there is a marble image of Lord Shiva which is worshipped by pilgrims The image is called the Chaumukha The lake and its surroundings present an impressive view The still clear and unpolluted waters of the lake reflect the snowcapped peaks that overlook the valley There is also a small temple in the shikhara style on the periphery of the lake A brass image of Lakshmi Devi known as Mahishasuramardini is deified in the temple

The holy pilgrimage to the Manimahesh Lake revered by local people as resting place of Lord Shiva is supported by the Government of Himachal Pradesh Manimahesh Pilgrimage Committee and several voluntary organizations For the Gaddi tribal population of the region pilgrimage to the lake is most holy It is held every year during the Hindu month of Badon on Radhastami the 15th day following the festival of Janmashtami corresponding to the Gregorian month of August or September The Yatra or Jatra as it is called is also popularly known as the Manimahesh Yatra It is heralded by a procession known locally as holy chhari holy stick carried by the pilgrims on their shoulders trek undertaken by pilgrims and sadhus Pilgrims undertake the holy trek barefoot and cover a distance of from the nearest road point of Hadsar to the Manimahesh Lake Lord Shiva is the presiding deity of the yatra The colorful procession of the chhari is accompanied by singing and recitation of hymns in praise of Lord Shiva The Chhari trek considered a tough trek follows a set ancient route with stops at the designated places To facilitate this trek pilgrims are provided with facilities of transport jeeps up to road ends food and medical facilities and so forth It is a twoday trek to the lake from Hadsar with a night halt at Dhanchho Tents are available for hire at Bharmour or Chamba Himachal Pradesh Ponies are hired by some devotees for the trek Direct trekking from Chamba is also an option undertaken by the devout which is a nineday trek the route followed is Rakh  Bharmaur Hadsar  Dhancho  and Manimahesh  with a brief halt at Bhiram Ghati The return trip follows the same route

The holy trek starts from the Laxmi Narayan temple and the Dashnami Akhara in Chamba town with the sacred stick Chhari of Gur Charpathnath carried by the pilgrims with participation of sadhus The trek to the lake takes about 6 days After the procession arrives at the lake ceremonies are held all through the night On the following day pilgrims take a holy dip naun in the lake After taking bath in the holy waters of the lake pilgrims circumambulate the lake three times as an act of reverence seeking blessings of the Lord Shiva However before taking a final dip in the Mani Mahesh Lake women devotees take a dip at the Gauri Khund which is situated about a mile short of the lake while men take bath at Shiv Karotri a part of the main lake The belief is that Parvati Shivas consort bathed at the Gauri Khund while Shiva took his bath at the Shiv Karotri State priests of Bharmaur Brahmin family perform the worship Pujas in all temples within the lake precincts

A final song People in My Life Sugar was taken out during the previews but has appeared in some later productions
In his review of the Broadway production Time theatre critic TE Kalem thought the musical has been so thoroughly processed refined and filtered that it has lost the natural energy that makes a good musical strong and healthy He added If hummable songs are a plus Jule Stynes songs are hummable though you may not know quite which homogenized number you are humming As for Bob Merrills lyrics they are the labored products of a man hovering over a rhyming dictionary Sugar is almost a textbook case of a musical born after its time It may well enjoy great wads of audience favor But in the past three years Company and Follies have altered the critical perspective by providing a musical form that is spare intelligent ironic mature and capable of sustaining threedimensional characters He concluded This is not to say that the big oldfashioned musical is irrevocably doomed but it must have a singular mood manner and meaning all its own Otherwise all that remains as Sugar indicates is a sterile display of highgloss techniques

Dyan McBride director of a 2012 San Francisco production of the musical noted in an interview that Written in 1972 Sugar really has one of the last Golden Age of Broadway scores You can feel contemporary Broadway starting to come This is not a rock n roll score this is really a jazzy score But you can start to hear things changing theres a little bit of lounge and you can hear some Bob Goulet

Adobe AIR
Adobe AIR formerly Adobe Integrated Runtime is a crossplatform runtime system developed by Adobe Systems for building desktop applications and mobile applications programmed using Adobe Animate ActionScript and optionally Apache Flex The runtime supports installable applications on Windows OS X and mobile operating systems including Android iOS and BlackBerry Tablet OS It also originally ran on Linux but support was discontinued as of version 26 in 2011

Adobe AIR is a runtime environment that allows Adobe Animate content and ActionScript 30 coders to construct applications and video games that run as a stand alone app and behave similar to a native application on supported platforms A Flash Player or HTML5 application used in a browser does not require installation while AIR applications require installation from an installer file Windows and OS X or the appropriate App Store iOS and Android AIR applications have unrestricted access to local storage and file systems while browserbased applications only have access to individual files selected by users

Adobe AIR internally uses a shared codebase with the Flash Player rendering engine and ActionScript 30 as the primary programming language Applications must specifically be built for Adobe AIR to use additional features provided such as multitouch file system integration native client extensions integration with Taskbar or Dock and access to accelerometer and GPS devices HTML5 applications may run on the WebKit engine included in AIR

Notable applications built with Adobe AIR include eBay Desktop Pandora One desktop TweetDeck the former Adobe Media Player Angry Birds and Machinarium among other multimedia and task management applications According to Adobe over 100000 unique applications have been built on AIR and over 1 billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world as of May 2014 Adobe AIR was voted as the Best Mobile Application Development product at the Consumer Electronics Show for two consecutive years CES 2014 and CES 2015
Using AIR developers can access functionality including text vector graphics raster graphics video audio camera and microphone capability Adobe AIR also includes additional features such as file system integration native client extensions desktop integration and access to connected devices AIR enables applications to work with data in different ways including using local files local SQLite databases for which AIR has builtin support a database server or the encrypted local store included with AIR

Developers can access additional functionality by building AIR Native Extensions which can access full device functionality being programmed in the native language

On desktop platforms AIR supports

On mobile platforms AIR supports many mobile hardware features

In 2011 the addition of Stage3D allowed AIR apps access to GPUs for hardware acceleration Several thirdparty frameworks have been developed to build upon the functionality of Stage3D including the Starling Framework and Away3D These frameworks are also compatible with AIR and provide vital performance improvements to AIR apps published for mobile devices

AIR apps can be augmented in functionality with the usage of AIR Native Extensions ANEs Native extensions are plugin code libraries that contain native code wrapped with an ActionScript API allowing developers to access native features not otherwise usable in AIR such as Apple Game Center or Google Cloud Messaging

Native extensions may be developed by anyone using publicly available tools some are distributed for free or even as open source while others are sold commercially

Native extensions may be programmed in the native language on each platform allowing access to the full set of platform APIs provided by the developer C for Windows Java for Android ObjectiveC for iOS

AIR is a crossplatform technology and AIR applications can be repackaged with few or no changes for many popular desktop and mobile platforms Different installation options exist for each platform

AIR applications may be published with or without the AIR runtime Applications packaged with the AIR runtime are larger in file size and are known as captive runtime applications If the runtime is not embedded in the app it must be installed separately

In January 2009 Adobe claimed that there were over 100 million installations of Adobe AIR worldwide and that the majority of AIR runtime installations occur at the time the first AIR application is installed by a user In May 2014 Adobe claimed that over 100000 unique applications were built on AIR and over 1 billion installations of the same were logged from users across the world

The latest version of Adobe AIR version 28 contains Adobe Flash Player 28 and is available for Windows 7 and later as well as OS X 109 and later Official support for desktop Linux distributions ceased in June 2011 with version 26

Adobe AIR applications can be published as native phone applications on certain mobile operating systems such as Android ARM CortexA8 and above and Apple iOS
Adobe AIR runs applications within a contained Flash Player instance It runs web applications via WebKit rendering engine Multiple instances of the browser can be started within a single AIR application but JavaScript content executes with some security limitations

AIR does not provide direct access to native GUI elements such as navigation bars or controls Native extensions can be used to access additional native resources

The AIR SDK is available as a free standalone download for software developers to make AIR applications SDK users do not need to install any commercial software to use the SDK although several options are available AIR apps can be compiled from the command line using the AIR compiler included in the SDK the compiler can also be called from an IDE to eliminate the need for the command line

AIR can also be used with Adobe Flex Flex is an integrated collection of stylable graphical user interface data manipulation and networking components and applications built upon it are known as Flex applications Flex GUIs are defined in MXML similar to how Android and Microsoft Visual Studio define GUIs however Flex does not give access to native GUI components

AIR applications built without the Flex framework allow greater flexibility and performance and are known as pure ActionScript applications Video games built on the AIR platform are typically pureActionscript projects Various opensource component frameworks are available for pure ActionScript projects such as MadComponents that provide UI Components at significantly smaller SWF file sizes

Adobe distributes three commercial software products for developing of AIR applications in ActionScript

Thirdparty development environments that target the AIR runtime are also available including

Adobe Flash Builder is the premium tool for Flex application development since it includes an integrated draganddrop user interface builder not found in competing tools like FlashDevelop

Adobe provides for AIR HTML5 and JavaScript development with Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 although any other HTML editor or text editor can be used

Adobe AIR can run a subset of JavaScript with no ability to dynamically execute code when running in the application sandbox According to Adobe this restriction is designed to prevent malicious remote content from attacking a users system Because of this restriction JavaScript frameworks that make use of dynamic JavaScript functions like eval were not initially compatible with Adobe AIR However several frameworks including Dojo Toolkit jQuery and ExtJS were updated to run in Adobe AIRs application sandbox Some frameworks like MooTools were already compatible

Dreamweaver CS4CS3 requires an additional extension to compile AIR applications as does Flash CS3 in the form of an update

Adobe made a public preview release of AIR then called Apollo along with a software development kit SDK and extension for developing Apollo applications with the Flex framework on March 19 2007

On June 10 2007 Apollo was renamed to AIR and a public beta release of the runtime was launched Public beta 2 of AIR SDK was released on October 1 2007 Public beta 3 was released on December 12 2007

Henri Ghon
Henri Ghon March 15 1875  June 13 1944 born Henri Vangeon in BraysurSeine SeineetMarne was a French playwright novelist poet and critic

Brought up by a devout Roman Catholic mother he lost his faith in his early teens while still at the Lyce in Sens Among the factors that brought this about one stood out in his own mind at school religion was taught without life or understanding Ghon did not miss it As F J Sheed says His was a happy atheism He replaced Catholicism with a semipagan cult of beauty in all its forms  nature literature music painting

He moved to Paris in 1893 to study medicine Around the same time he started to write poetry along with his colleagues Francis Jammes and Stphane Mallarm He also published avant garde criticism In 1887 he met Andr Gide who became his literary guide and friend for twenty years Ghon writes Gides biographer Alan Sheridan was Gides closest friend and companion on innumerable homosexual exploits Ghon actually drafted a militant text in favour of homosexuality La Vie secrte de Guillaume Arnoult which was one of the inspirations for Gides Corydon In 1909 they were founding members of the Nouvelle Revue Franaise NRF Ghon also painted studied music and travelled widely

It was the sceptic Gide who occasioned the first cracks in Ghons paganism when he invited him to visit Florence with him in 1912 There Ghon discovered the religious art of Giotto and Fra Angelico and was overwhelmed to the point of shedding tears At St Marks he wrote with Christ dying on the cross and the Virgin waiting for the angel in a bare and silent corridor even our senses had a soul Art had transported me before but never so high

He served as an army doctor in the First World War During this period he regained his Catholic faith as described in his work Lhomme n de la guerre The Man Born from the War His conversion was bound up with a devoutly Catholic naval officer Pierre Dominique Dupouey whom he met only three times in the space of a few weeks but who impressed him greatly It was again Gide who was the occasion for this fateful encounter when Ghon left for the Belgian front Gide urged him to try to find Dupouey who had once been his disciple and with whom he still corresponded On Holy Saturday 1915 Dupouey was killed in action on the Yser By Christmas Ghon had returned to the Catholic faith

He founded the Compagnons de Notre Dame Companions of Our Lady a sort of amateur theatre confraternity of young people for which he wrote over 60 plays usually on episodes from the Gospel or the lives of the saints Ghons plays had clear similarities with the medieval mystery and miracle plays The Companions of Our Lady performed with success in Paris and throughout France as well as in Belgium Holland and Switzerland and Ghon was awarded a prize for his work by the Acadmie franaise He also wrote poems saints biographies and novels among them a threepart work Les Jeux de lenfer et du ciel Games of Hell and Heaven centred on the Cur dArs

Ghon died of cancer in a Paris clinic on June 13 1944 a week after the Allied landing in Normandy and six days after the opening of his most recent play Saint Gilles

In 2008 the writer and philosopher Fabrice Hadjadj reviewing Catherine BoschianCampaners biography of Ghon in Le Figaro wrote Henri Ghon is not a minor writer and his work speaks for itself If his novels recall Dickens his theatre loses nothing in comparison with Anouilh and Giraudoux It was he alone who in the first half of the 20th century revived the popular burlesque and verticality of the medieval mystery plays thus anticipating Dario Fo

His Miroir de Peine was set to music by Hendrik Andriessen

MV Spirit of Gosport
MV Spirit of Gosport is a vessel owned by the Gosport Ferry Company Ltd and built by Abels Shipbuilders in Bristol

Spirit of Gosport was built in 2001 to replace Portsmouth Queen on ferry duties However the company also wanted to replace Solent Enterprise which operated cruise duties The vessel was hardly used for the first few months and both existing ferries were kept in service In 2003 she finally replaced Solent Enterprise on cruise duties This continued until 2005 when a brand new vessel was purchased to replace Spirit of Gosport on cruise duties

Shortly after being awarded the contract for Spirit of Gosport Abels were awarded a followon contract for a second ferry to be known as Spirit of Portsmouth However this vessel was only partially constructed when the ferry company cancelled the order and the unfinished hull remained at Abels shipyard for many years before being completed as a medical missionary ship the Forth Hope This ship should not be confused with the subsequent Spirit of Portsmouth that now operates alongside the Spirit of Gosport

John Scudder physician
Dr John Scudder 1900  December 1976 was a medical doctor and blood transfusion specialist who developed the Plasma for Britain program during the early years of World War II He recruited Dr Charles Drew to help develop the organization and its processes to get the plasma supply project operational Their work was estimated to have helped save the lives of thousands of Allied troops

Scudder was born to John and Ellen Bartholemew Scudder in 1900 in Brooklyn New York He attended Rutgers University before deciding to be a surgeon He completed medical school at Columbia University where he also did graduatelevel work on blood research and surgical procedures for its use 

His family was part of the Scudders in India who devoted more than 1100 combined years to Christian medical mission service Four generations of the family and 42 members served in India

After obtaining his doctorate Scudder began working and teaching at Columbia UniversityPresbyterian Hospital There he worked in blood transfusion and surgery He became an assistant professor of clinical surgery at Columbia University in 1935 He worked on research centering on whole blood then on fractionated blood and plasmas By 1940 he was doing research on blood fluid dynamics as well

In late 1939 after World War II began in Europe the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association BTBA of New York met with certain members of the British medical establishment about transfusion techniques Plasma transfusion was possible at that time but still experimental No one had a good method for supplementing Britains supplies with American blood plasma This was crucial since by all expectations any war was expected to have the high casualties similar to those of World War I 

The managers of the BTBA turned to Dr Scudder to organize the project He recruited Charles Drew one of his brightest graduate students and recently minted PhD to lead the project During the course of Plasma for Britain Scudder often assisted Drew in organizing and communicating with project managers and other medical authorities When Plasma for Britain was turned over to the British Military Scudder returned to his teaching and research position at Columbia

Scudder continued research in fields related both to blood work and surgery He published papers on shock syndrome banked blood and using chemicals and Xrays to map the cardiovascular system He coauthored many papers 

In the 1960s when there was a conflict between the Red Cross and the forprofit American Association of Blood Banks Scudder publicly supported the Red Cross He stated that blood donation should be a matter of civic responsibility not profiteering 

His health began to fail in the early 1970s He died in December 1976 at the age of 76

The following table shows the title Tempo marking voices time key and text sources for the seven movements The information is given for the beginning of the movements Rutter frequently shifts tempo key and time The source for the details is the vocal score unless otherwise noted

The first movement consists of the Introit from the Requiem Requiem aeternam and the Kyrie The work opens with a steady beat of the tympani to which instruments enter first without a defined key The voices enter in measure 7 stating in unison on the note C Requiem aeternam The text beginning Kyrie eleison is set in G major

The second movement is entitled Out of the Deep the English version of Psalm 130 a psalm commonly used at Anglican funerals It is set in C minor and begins with an expanded cello solo Its motifs are picked up by the voices first alto and bass in unison in low register

The third movement is the Pie Jesu a text that concludes the sequence Dies irae Rutter as before him Faur and Durufl omit the sequence but include the prayer to Jesus for rest It begins with a soprano soloist singing with a very light accompaniment with only slight involvement of the chorus echoing the words Dona eis requiem Dona eis sempiternam requiem

The central movement is the Sanctus with Benedictus a lively and exclamatory movement which is brightly orchestrated with bells flute and oboe and occasional timpani recalling the passage in Old Testament scripture in Isaiah chapter 6 and the worship of the sixwinged seraphim in the heavenly throneroom of God

The fifth movement is the Agnus Dei Lamb of God of the Requiem Rutter uses a steady beat on one note similar to the timpani of the first movement The Latin text is contrasted with another biblical passage Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live from the Book of Job The call Agnus Dei in measure 58 is the dynamic climax of the Requiem After an instrumental interlude which quotes a melody associated with Easter the voices sing very softly I am the resurrection and the life from the Book of John

The sixth movement is Psalm 23 another psalm commonly used at Anglican funerals It mentions the valley of the shadow of death but is an expression of trust in God and hope for dwelling in his house forever

The seventh movement includes words from the 1662 Book of Common Prayer Burial Service I heard a voice from heaven and the communion chant from Requiem Lux aeterna

The work lasts about 40 minutes

Resource allocation computer
In computing resource allocation is necessary for any application to be run on the system When the user opens any program this will be counted as a process and therefore requires the computer to allocate certain resources for it to be able to run Such resources could have access to a section of the computers memory data in a device interface buffer one or more files or the required amount of processing power

A computer with a single processor can only perform one process at a time regardless of the amount of programs loaded by the user or initiated on startup Computers using single processors appear to be running multiple programs at once because the processor quickly alternates between programs processing what is needed in very small amounts of time This process is known as multitasking or time slicing The time allocation is automatic however higher or lower priority may be given to certain processes essentially giving high priority programs morebigger slices of the processors time

On a computer with multiple processors different processes can be allocated to different processors so that the computer can truly multitask Some programs such as Adobe Photoshop and YafRay which can require intense processing power have been coded so that they are able to run on more than one processor at once thus running more quickly and efficiently
This method is generally suitable for multiprogramming environments and is actually very helpful

Prison of StLaurentduMaroni
The prison of SaintLaurentduMaroni was the main penal establishment of French Guiana for a century Some of the buildings were restored in the early 1980s

On 22 November 1850 Napoleon III declared Six thousand condemned men in our prisons weigh heavily on our budget becoming increasingly depraved and constantly menacing our society I think it is possible to make the sentence of forced labour more effective more moralising less expensive and more humane by using it to further the progress of French colonisation

The first batch of prisoners left the Breton port of Brest for the les du Salut on 31 March 1852 The prison at StLaurentduMaroni was established on the banks of the Maroni River on 21 February 1858 All the prisoners sent from France were taken there before being transferred to other prisons or camps The town of SaintLaurentduMaroni proper was founded on 16 March 1880 it was a penal town whose inhabitants were nearly all guards or liberated prisoners The hospital was built in 1912 and the prison itself closed in 1946 the same year the whole colonial penal system was abolished

The prison at SaintLaurent was but a temporary stop for most prisoners Only a small number of men ever stayed in SaintLaurent for long and they were nearly all employed in the penitentiary administration or were considered harmless and unlikely to try to escape

When a ship such as La Loire or La Martinire arrived from SaintMartindeR the first order of the day was to separate the chevaux de retour literally returned horses but meaning the escaped prisoners and the recidivists from the rest to send them to the les du Salut from whose shores escape was considered impossible A few however succeeded most famously Henri Charrire who later wrote Papillon The new prisoners then stayed for a while in SaintLaurent where they were sorted into different camps or prisons The ones considered to be shifty and eager to escape were sent to the islands along with the recidivists and exescapees The least dangerous men condemned to prison for petty offences were offered jobs in the penitentiary administration The prisoners were also separated by nationality as there were special camps reserved for those from Indochina and the Arabs often became guards

Since there was a hospital in SaintLaurent many prisoners faked illnesses to get sent there where they had plenty of time to plot escapes as experienced and written by among others Charrire Since many prisoners worked in the hospital this was not terribly hard to do

Those who were lucky enough to stay in SaintLaurent were generally better treated than prisoners in other camps Their work was simple they were free to go wherever they wanted inside the prison and were given better rations

Sundance charter vessel
Sundance is a charter vessel owned by Capital Pleasure Boats and operating on the River Thames Former names are Gay Enterprise and Solent Enterprise

The vessel was built in 1971 for the Gosport Ferry service by James and Stone of Brightlingsea primarily for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent Originally called Gay Enterprise the name was changed in the winter of 1979 during her standby ferry duties to Solent Enterprise It had a similar design to the companys two 1966 Queens Portsmouth Queen and Gosport Queen but the interior was more comfortable because of its different duty It was painted in later years in a blue livery with a large Solent Enterprise banner on its side barriers In its later years of service it was regularly used on ferry duties between Gosport and Portsmouth when either of the Queens were out of service In 2001 Gosport Ferry Company purchased a new ferry the Spirit of Gosport but the company also wanted to replace the Solent Enterprise in its cruising role Both Queens therefore stayed on and the Spirit of Gosport only had a few ferry duties in its first few months In 2005 another new vessel was purchased Spirit of Portsmouth This was fitted out with a covered top deck and a bar and to suit its cruise duties This meant that Solent Enterprise was no longer required by the Gosport Ferry service and she was sold to Capital Pleasure Boats in 2005 Her new owners renamed her Sundance and she operated on the River Thames in London as a charter vessel catering for parties corporate entertainment weddings and other functions Later she was sold again and moved to Copenhagen to be used as a floating cafe However in the early hours of the morning of 11 February 2016 a fire broke out on board completely engulfing the top deck and left her badly damaged Sundance was repaired and turned back into a houseboat but remains in Copenhagen today under new ownership

Architectural Design
Architectural Design also known as AD is a UKbased architectural journal first launched in 1930 as Architectural Design and Construction The journal is currently published by John Wiley  Sons and is edited by Helen Castle since 2001

In its early days the journal was more concerned with the British scene but it gradually became more international In 1946 Monica Pidgeon became editor and developed the magazine under the ownership of Standard Catalogue Company Contributors during the 1960s included Theo Crosby and Kenneth Frampton

It moved away from presenting mostly news towards themebased issues During the late 1970s and 1980s it was the bastion of Postmodernism with frequent articles and special editions guestedited by Charles Jencks the theoretical father of postmodern architecture At that time the journal was the mouthpiece of the publishers Academy Editions marketed in the USA under St Martins Press based in Leinster Gardens London they also had their own bookstore and they published very many wellknown titles concerned with postmodernism The longstanding EditorinChief until the mid1980s was Andreas Papadakis

The content of the journal is seen during the latter half of its history as running parallel with the cutting edge of avantgardism promoting innovation as well as celebrity status  stararchitects Thus at the height of Postmodernism in the late 1970s  when it often featured the works of Michael Graves Robert Stern Leon Krier James Stirling Robert Krier and Aldo Rossi  it also published Rem Koolhaass later influential book Delirious New York 1979 An undercurrent to Postmodernism featured in the journal was that of architecture without a style a vernacular classical architecture epitomised by the work of Quinlan Terry Demetri Porphyrios and John Simpson

The journal went partly into decline with the demise of postmodernism though it then shifted its coverage towards Deconstructivism folding in architecture blob architecture biomorphism and digital architecture The shift in emphasis can be pinpointed to a single edition of the journal devoted to the two polar positions at that time Peter Eisenman versus Leon Krier My ideology is better than yours Architectural Design 9101989 The current avantgardist interest of the journal in biomorphism is a return to issues the journal was covering in the 1960s and 1970s before posism with the architecture of Archigram Cedric Price and the thinking of Reyner Banham

The publication became part of John Wiley  Sons in 1997 when it acquired ADs German publisher VCH who had acquired the title from Andreas Papadakis Academy Editions in 1991

According to theatre critic Ken Mandelbaum Billy was a brassy Broadwaystyle musical and it took advantage of the services of topnotch American choreographer Onna White But its trump card was its star Michael Crawford Mandelbaum quoted the reviews The Daily Mail wrote There is no magic quite like being right there when a star is born and that was typical of the raves Crawford received But his vehicle was equally acclaimed The Daily Express called Billy the most successful British musical since Oliver while The Sunday People called it the brightest British musical for yearsits going to hoist brilliant Michael Crawford into the ranks of the superstars 

The Original Cast recording was released by CBS 70133 on May 1 1974
