Stephens Media newspapers
Stephens Media LLC was a Las Vegas Nevada diversified media investment company It owned stakes in the California Newspapers Partnership and the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette

The company had been expanding its interactive Internet business operating online sites for its newspapers and portal sites like LasVegascom which is licensed to Greenspun Media Group The company is also a partner in the California Newspapers Partnership with MediaNews and Gannett The company also formed Northwest Arkansas Newspapers LLC in November 2009 a joint venture with WEHCO Media Inc in Arkansas

On November 28 2010 Stephens Media Iowa LLC a subsidiary of Stephens Media acquired several newspapers including the Ames Tribune Boone NewsRepublican Dallas County News Nevada Journal Ames About People  Advertiser TriCounty Times and Algona Upper Des Moines from Midlands Newspapers Inc a subsidiary of the Omaha WorldHerald Company In August 2011 the Algona Upper Des Moines was sold to Hallmark Media 

In February 2015 Stephens Media was purchased by GateHouse Media for 1028 million In December 2015 GateHouse sold the Las Vegas ReviewJournal the Stephens groups largest paper to casino magnate Sheldon Adelson for 140 million

The company was formerly called Donrey Media Group which was founded by Arkansas media mogul Donald W Reynolds and based in Fort Smith Arkansas After Reynolds died in 1993 at the age of 86 the company was sold to the Stephens family of Arkansas known for their Little Rock investment banking business Stephens Inc Some of Donreys properties were sold off and the company moved its headquarters to Las Vegas Nevada home of its largest newspaper the Las Vegas ReviewJournal The company was renamed Stephens Media Group in 2002 In June 2006 the company became known as Stephens Media LLC The company has no connection with Stephens Media Group a radio broadcasting company in Tulsa Oklahoma

In 2010 Stephens Media contracted with the litigation firm Righthaven LLC giving it the power to enforce the companys copyrights when online violators go beyond the bounds of fair use More than 141 lawsuits have been filed in US District Court in Las Vegas since midMarch

In a column published in the RJ shortly after the lawsuits began publisher Sherman Frederick said the primary goal with the partnership with Righthaven was to deter theft of the companys copyrighted materials He said if the company was successful he hoped Righthaven would find other media clients In late August WEHCO Media which owns the Arkansas DemocratGazette and the Chattanooga Times Free Press signed on with the firm MediaNews Group has also used Righthaven to file a copyright infringement suit

The aggressive enforcement of the Stephens Media copyrights by Righthaven was being closely watched by other publishers as is the debate it has generated Critics of the relatively new practice have coined it copyright trolling and argue that the purpose of such enforcement is to make a profit In the Poynter article Stephens Media general counsel Mark Hinueber says the goal is to make sure the companys intellectual rights are protected We were seeing our entire work product in some stories just being rightclicked and cut and pasted into blogs where people were selling Google ads around them and making money The Las Vegas Sun has been thoroughly documenting Righthavens activities and the response The Suns outside law firm Lewis and Roca is defending several of the Righthaven suits

Targets of the Righthaven lawsuits included bloggers political forums major political parties and several of the newspapers own sources including NORML DailyPaulcom Infowars Free Republic and others On August 25 2010 the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF announced that they will make efforts to assist Righthaven LLC defendants to the best of their ability

Righthavens lawsuits came under increasing judicial scrutiny which led to Righthaven being found in June 2011 to lack standing to sue for alleged infringement of copyrighted material to which it holds only a limited license as such a license does not confer the right to sue for infringement Sanctions against Righthaven and its attorney Steven A Gibson of Nevada law firm Dickinson Wright are currently being contemplated by one judge Righthaven later had its assets seized to pay judgments levied against it in lawsuits it filed against those whom it said infringed on the copyrights of clients As a result copyrights which had been sold by Stephens to Righthaven were sold back to Stephens for 80000 to pay legal fees

In September 2009 Stephens Media and WEHCO Media Inc owner of the Arkansas DemocratGazette announced plans to combine their newspaper operations in Northwest Arkansas and operate as a single company The venture was approved in November 2009 by the US Justice Department and a new Arkansas Limited Liability Company Northwest Arkansas Newspapers LLC was formed Stephens Media sold its interest in the joint venture to WEHCO on May 5 2016 which assumed control of all operations of the newspapers in the joint venture

Newspapers in the joint venture include

Henry Yesler
Henry L Yesler December 2 1810  December 16 1892 was an entrepreneur and a politician regarded as a founder of the city of Seattle Yesler served two nonconsecutive terms as Mayor of Seattle and was the citys wealthiest resident during his lifetime

Yesler arrived in Seattle from Ohio in 1852 and built a steampowered sawmill which provided numerous jobs for those early settlers and Duwamish tribe members The mill was located right on the Elliott Bay waterfront at the foot of what is now known as Yesler Way and was then known as Mill Road or the Skid Road so named for the practice of skidding greased logs down the steep grade from the everreceding timber line to the mill In running the mill Yesler built the citys first water system in 1854 The system was made up of a series of openair Vshaped flumes perched on stilts that started atop First Hill and ran down past Yeslers residence and to the mill Later on after complaints of dirty water Yesler developed a system made up of log pipes and iron buried beneath the ground 
In 1858 Yeslers wife Sarah joined him in Seattle and the couple lived in a simple house across from the mill 
Yesler also served in public office at various times as a county auditor county commissioner and mayor
On June 6 1889 the Great Seattle Fire destroyed the entire business district which consisted mainly of wooden buildings including Yeslers sawmill Yeslers Hall a theater on the corner of and 1st Avenue and Yeslers Pavilion a civic center on 1st and Cherry Street They were never replaced In 1892 Yesler erected the Pioneer Building on the same plot of land where his first home stood now the heart of Seattles Pioneer Square Sarah Yesler had died in 1887 but Yesler built a large new mansion and shared his mansion with a younger female relative some sources describe her as a maid whom he married five months later
Yesler died on December 16 1892 at the age of 82 He is buried in Seattles Lake View Cemetery After his death Yeslers mansion became the first home of the Seattle Public Library and burned down on January 2 1901 The King County Courthouse currently occupies the site

In his informative and tongueincheek book Sons of the Profits columnist and Seattle historian William C Speidel pointed out some of Yeslers negative aspects On numerous occasions Yesler had lawsuits filed against him On other occasions it was Yesler himself doing the suing The City of Seattle made him a millionaire wrote Speidel yet he sued itfought itplundered itand on two occasions he brought it to the brink of bankruptcy Speidel also recounts how according to courthouse records Yesler owed John McLain an old friend from Ohio 30000 for the loan that the latter set up for construction of the mill Yesler would pay him 12000 of it over time and it wasnt until McLain sued him that he was able to collect on the rest
Yesler and his wife Sarah were Spiritualists and believed in free love

Egypt at the 1912 Summer Olympics
The Egyptian Olympic Committee considers the nation to have first competed in the Summer Olympic Games at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm Sweden According to the official report the nation sent one fencer Ahmed Hassanein who competed in the individual foil and pe events There is uncertainty however as to whether he competed as the official report lists all entrants in fencing regardless of their actual participation and no results are known for Hassanein

In 1912 Egypt was de jure under the control of the Ottoman Empire but had been de facto run by the British since 1882 At the 1896 Summer Olympics an athlete by the name of Dionysios Kasdaglis competed in tennis and won silver medals in the singles and doubles tournaments Kasdaglis is listed as Greek by the IOC for the singles but in the doubles he and his Greek partner Demetrios Petrokokkinos are listed as a mixed team Kasdaglis had British citizenship but lived in Egypt and was a member of Egyptian clubs and thus he has been considered by some as an Egyptian Olympian Two athletes Arthur Marson and Eugenio Colombani competed under the Egyptian flag at the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized as Olympic by the International Olympic Committee IOC but were considered as such by contemporary sources The Egyptian Olympic Committee founded in 1910 considers Egypts first Olympic delegation to have been at the 1912 Summer Olympics which is supported by that years official report There is uncertainty however as to whether the fencer they sent Ahmed Hassanein actually competed as the official report lists all entrants in the fencing events regardless of their actual participation

According to the official report Hassanein competed in both the individual foil and pe events In the former he was part of Pool XIV which included upcoming bronze medalist Richard Verderber of Austria and it is recorded only that he did not advance to the quarterfinals In the latter he was placed in Pool II which included eventual Olympic champion Paul Anspach of Belgium and again it is noted only that he did not make it out of the round Hassanein would go on to compete in both disciplines at the 1920 Summer Olympics and in pe in 1924 but never won a medal

United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi
The United Nations Integrated Office in Burundi BINUB was established by the United Nations Security Council to support the government of Burundi in its efforts towards longterm peace and stability and to replace the work of United Nations Operation in Burundi ONUB Its mandate was scheduled to begin on 1 January 2007 for an initial 12 months and its creation and mission was as a result of recommendations in a report by the SecretaryGeneral

The previous UN mission in Burundi ONUB was created to facilitate the implementation of the peace agreements signed between the previous government and the CNDDFDD rebel group The CNDDFDDs leader Pierre Nkurunziza went on to win the Burundian elections in 2005 and his party effectively controls the Burundian government

The reasons for establishing a second mission in Burundi following directly on the ONUB missions was the ceasefire agreement reached between the new CNDDFDD government and the last remaining rebel group PalipehutuFNL This ceasefire agreement was signed on 7 September 2006 in Dar es Salaam Tanzania after mediation by South Africa in talks that began in May Among the key points in the agreement were a complete cessation of hostilities temporary immunity for FNL fighters and the demobilization of these troops and their subsequent integration into the armed forces of Burundi in line with earlier peace agreements in this conflict that all stipulated powersharing arrangements in the security sector

The BINUB mission was created to facilitate the implementation of this ceasefire agreement with the most important point of the mandate being the support of the implementation of the modalities of the agreement assistance in the reform of the security sector and support of the reintegration of excombatants The Burundian government also requested the BINUB to help in the establishment of rule of law good governance and freedom of press and media

The mandate of BINUB currently extends to the end of 2010

It was replaced by the United Nations Office in Burundi BNUB on 1 January 2011

Bamburgh Dunes
Bamburgh Dunes are a region of coastal sand dunes with an area of over 40 hectares situated around the village of Bamburgh in Northumberland England The dunes which stand in the shadow of the impressive Bamburgh Castle have been a Site of Special Scientific Interest SSSI since 1995 and are part of the North Northumberland Dunes Special Area of Conservation SAC The dunes have a rich diversity of flora and fauna and in places provide good examples of climbing dunes found where sand has been blown onto high ground adjacent to the beach

Bamburgh Dunes vary from open sandy beaches through low ridges dominated by marram grass to more stable grasscovered dunes These occur as a series of irregular parallel sand ridges and hummocks separated by hollows which are seasonally wet Some of the plant species include the pyramidal orchid Centaurium sea sandwort and petalwort which is on the List of endangered species in the British Isles  The dunes are also rich in rare insect life over 500 species have been identified including 15 rare species including a plant hopper Dicranotropis divergens a grassmining fly Opomyza punctata and a shore fly Psilopa marginella Birds attracted to the dunes include grasshopper warbler sedge warbler European stonechat meadow pipit and reed bunting In winter shorteared owl and water rail are also found

Over the years more vigorous invasive plant species and scrub have encroached making the dune system too stabilised and threatening the uniqueness of Bamburgh Dunes most rare plant species appreciate the unstable and shifting structure of sand dunes In an effort to counteract this Bamburgh Castle Estate English Nature DEFRA Northumberland County Council and Bamburgh Parish Council have come up with a plan of management which has resulted in cattle being allowed to graze the dunes since 2000 to break up the dominant grass cover A fence has been erected to contain the cattle within the dunes access by people is encouraged within the fenced area with stiles and gates sited on the main paths
An ancient AngloSaxon 7th century burial ground was unearthed in the dunes to the south east of Bamburgh Castle during an archaeological dig in 1998 by the Bamburgh Research Project The burial ground called the Bowl Hole had been known to exist since 1816 when violent storms removed large amounts of dune sand and uncovered the site for a period The BBC television programme Meet the Ancestors became involved during the dig and screened a programme about the finds in February 2001

Loopswitch sequence
A loopswitch sequence also known as the forcase paradigm or AntiDuffs Device is a programming antipattern where a clear set of steps is implemented as a switchwithinaloop The loopswitch sequence is a specific derivative of spaghetti code

It is not necessarily an antipattern to use a switch statement within a loopit is only considered incorrect when used to model a known sequence of steps The most common example of the correct use of a switch within a loop is an inversion of control such as an event handler In event handler loops the sequence of events is not known at compiletime so the repeated switch is both necessary and correct see eventdriven programming event loop and eventdriven finite state machine

This is not a performance antipattern though it may lead to an inconsequential performance penalty due to the lack of an unrolled loop Rather it is a clarity antipattern as in any nontrivial example it is much more difficult to decipher the intent and actual function of the code than the more straightforward refactored solution

An eventdriven solution would implement a listener interface
But without the listener it becomes an example of the antipattern
And here is the refactored solution

<doc id="7728653" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7728653" title="Natures Valley">
Natures Valley
Natures Valley is a holiday resort and small village on the Garden Route along the southern Cape coast of South Africa Natures Valley lies between the Salt River the foothills of the Tsitsikamma Mountains the Indian Ocean and the Groot River lagoon Natures Valley has a balmy climate and is surrounded by the de Vasselot Nature Reserve which is part of the Tsitsikamma Park and in turn part of the Garden Route National Park

Natures Valley and the surrounding coastline was occupied by Old Stone Age or Paleolithic man from 1 million years ago Paleolithic man lived in the area in caves and under overhangs collecting food in the tidal zone and hunting for a rich variety of wildlife Various glacial periods interrupted this coastal occupation San huntergatherers lived in this area from about 10000 years ago until they were displaced by Khoikhoi herders from the interior

For a long time travel along the Garden Route parallel to the coastline was impossible due to the extremely deep and precipitous river gorges blocking all eastwest traffic Charles Collier Michell reported in 1839 there is no practical way  not even a footpath from Plettenberg Bay to the Tzitzikamma country Thomas Bain built a road from George to Knysna the socalled Seven Passes Road which took from 1867 to 1883 to complete Access to the coastal area which lay further east was possible only via the Langkloof valley which lies immediately north of the Tsitsikamma Mountains 

Natures Valley only became easily accessible after Thomas Bain completed the Grootrivier Pass in 1880 He and Captain Christopher Harison later Conservator of Forests first explored the route in 1868 to test its feasibility Harisons interest in the road stemmed from his belief that it could be used to halt the runaway destruction of the forest started by Dutch East India Company woodcutters in 1777 and carried on by their descendants At the time that Bain and Harison reconnoitred the route Bain was supervising the construction of no fewer than six passes so that 10 years would elapse before he could start work on the Groot River Pass A hundred years later the demands of road transport would dictate the building of a freeway with enormous concrete bridges  a tribute to the skill of engineers and bringing in its wake considerable collateral damage to the environment

After Bains completion of the Groot River Pass the Forestry Department proclaimed three lots in the Valley  one for its own use and the other two sold to private individuals The first person to settle in the now accessible valley and who acquired a 69hectare lot from Telfer Anderson was Hendrik Jacobus Hermanus Barnardo who had been a foreman at Bains Groot River construction camp Barnardo was an enigmatic character who went to extreme lengths to protect the trees of the area but enthusiastically led the slaughter of wildlife throughout the region Barnardo married three times and fathered 19 children Another member of his family shot the last Tsitsikamma elephant in 1881

In the face of continued pressure to sell a portion of his farm Barnardo finally relented in 1941 and sold an area of 16963 morgen to a syndicate of ten buyers for the sum of 755 In 1943 Baron Ulrich Behr of Kurland bought the option to purchase the remainder of Barnardos property from the Van Reenen family who had acquired the option in the 1920s but had never exercised it Behr then went through all the steps necessary to have the land proclaimed for development In 1953 the township was declared and formally named Natures Valley by Behr a name that had been used by the syndicate at the suggestion of Wide du Preez of The Crags

A network of trails covers the surrounding hills and beaches The lagoon offers sheltered water for sailing and canoeing without powerboating and beach buggies A walk along beaches and a rocky path leads to the Salt River Mouth after crossing Pebble Beach a large area completely covered in seasmoothed cobbles

East of Natures Valley is the Groot River Lagoon which marks the end of the Otter Trail starting at Storms River Mouth 60km further east This 5day trail is considered by many hikers to be the finest in South Africa being strenuous scenic and extremely varied The route meanders along the coast through evergreen forest past boulderstrewn beaches and frequently crossing tanninstained streams Huts are available for the hiker at the end of each day but bookings have to be made well in advance

The Brenton blue butterfly Orachrysops niobe was first described from Knysna by Roland Trimen in 1858 and was not seen again until discovered in 1977 at Natures Valley and shortly thereafter in 1979 at BrentononSea The Natures Valley population was assumed to be extinct when no more sightings were made after 1984 The cause of this decline was felt to be the absence of fynbos fires causing a shortage of the butterflys foodplant Indigofera erecta and accordingly a controlled burn was carried out in April 2003 with a reintroduction of butterfly eggs in August 2005

In 2000 researchers from the Albany Museum in Grahamstown discovered a number of aquatic insect species new to science in the Salt River which lies at the western end of Natures Valley The isolated position of the river a lack of fish and its acidic and unpolluted water are thought to have been factors in ensuring the undisturbed survival of these primitive forms New housing developments within the catchment area of the Salt River may threaten the continued existence of these unique insects

DirectorateGeneral for International Cooperation and Development
The DirectorateGeneral for International Cooperation and Development is one of the departments of the European Commission It operates under the authority of the European Commissioner for International Cooperation  Development Neven Mimica

Directorate General Development and Cooperation  EuropeAid was formed on 1 January 2011 following the merger of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office AIDCO with the Directorate General for Development and Relations with ACP States DEV AIDCO had been founded on 1 January 2001 with the mission of implementing the EU external aid programmes around the world At that time DG DEV and the Directorate General for External Relations RELEX were responsible for policy and programming 

Following the creation of EuropeAid in 2011 DirectorGeneral Fokion Fotiadis was responsible for the overall realisation of the DGs mission which consists in the programming and implementation of the European Commissions external aid instruments financed by the European Union budget and the European Development Funds In November 2013 Fernando Frutuoso de Melo succeeded Fokion Fotiadis as DirectorGeneral of the Directorate General 

EuropeAid focused on maximising the value and impact of aid funding by making sure support provided in a manner which complies with EU development objectives and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals in a speedy and accountable fashion Effective implementation and delivery of aid also helps the Commission and the EU as a whole to attain a higher profile on the world stage The European Union is the worlds largest aid donor

DG Development and Cooperation  EuropeAid was reformed into current form on 1 January 2015

DG International Cooperation and Development formulates the European Unions development policy abroad Its mission is to help reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty in developing countries through the promotion of sustainable development democracy peace and security

It works on policy formulation at a global and sectoral level The main intervention areas covered are Trade and regional integration Environment and the sustainable management of natural resources Infrastructure communications and transport Water and energy Rural development Governance democracy and human rights Peace and security Human development Social cohesion and employment EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States the Council the European Parliament and the Commission

When implementing projects it takes account of EU policy strategies and longterm programmes for the delivery of aid It translates policies into practical actions and develops new ways of delivering aid such as budget support and through sectoral approaches It also issues guidelines and makes evaluations of aid implementation In addition it is responsible for the proper management of funds and must use clear and transparent tendering and contracting procedures The programming cycle and responsibilities have evolved with the creation of the European External Action Service EEAS The EEAS has a key role in the programming of geographic instruments with EuropeAid and the EU Delegations 

DirectorateGeneral is responsible for all the steps of an aid delivery project after identifying needs it carries out feasibility studies and prepares all the necessary financial decisions and controls It then moves on to drawing up the required tendering monitoring and evaluation procedures EuropeAid often publishes these evaluations in its website aiming to improve management in particular by taking into account the lessons of past public actions and to reinforce capacity to account for and to ensure better transparency

This institution is a decentralised organisation Two out of three Commission staff members working on aid implementation are based in the field That is why most of the preparatory and implementation work is done through the EU Delegations in the beneficiary countries DirectorateGeneral is made up of more than 43 units divided into nine directorates attached to the Director General

To ensure coherence complementarity and coordination in implementing external assistance programmes worldwide DG DEVCO works in close collaboration with its various partners The overall aim is to make external aid more effective Civil society international organisations and governments of member states of the European Union are all important actors in this field

DirectorateGeneral awards grants and contracts to implement projects or activities that relate to the European Unions external aid programmes To ensure that EuropeAids work to improve peoples lives is recognised a set of visibility guidelines have been produced These guidelines ensure that aid projects acknowledge the funding support they receive from Commission budgets They also help to raise the general profile of the EU across the world

Development aid is financed directly by the EU budget 70 as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund EDF 30 The EUs external action financing is divided into geographic and thematic instruments The geographic instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument DCI 169 billion 20072013 which must spend 95 of its budget on overseas development assistance ODA and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument ENPI which contains some relevant programmes The EDF 227 bn 20082013 is made up of voluntary contributions by EU Member States There is currently a debate on whether to budgetise the EDF The perceived advantages include
The perceived disadvantages are that

Usually lasting 6 years each EDF lays out EU assistance to both individual countries and regions as a whole The EU is on its 10th EDF from 20082013 with a budget of 227 billion This represents about 30 of EU spending on development cooperation aid with the remainder coming directly from the EU budget

The budget of the 10th EDF can be broken down as follows

Negotiations for the 11th EDF would cover the period 20142020 This oneyear extension compared to the 10th EDF allowed the end of the 11th EDF to coincide with the expiration of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement in 2020 and the EU budget period The EDF has to date been funded outside the EU budget by the EU Member States on the basis of financial payments related to specific contribution shares or keys The Member State contributions keys are subject to negotiation The EDF is the only EU policy instrument that is financed through a specific key that is different from the EU budget key and which reflects the comparative interests of individual Member States

There was a debate on whether to budgetise the EDF However in the Communication A budget for Europe 2020 the European Commission underlined that it was not appropriate at present time to propose that the EDF be integrated into the EU budget The perceived advantages include
The perceived disadvantages are that

In 2005 the EU and its Member States agreed to achieve a collective level of ODA of 07 of GNI by 2015 and an interim target of 056 by 2010 with differentiated intermediate targets for those EU Member States which had recently joined the Union On the 23rd of May 2011 EU ministers responsible for development cooperation gathered to take stock of progress made and concluded that additional efforts would be needed to close an estimated gap of 50 billion to reach the selfimposed collective EU target of 07 by 2015

By 2015 the EU had not reached 07 of GNI though the commitment to this target was recently reaffirmed The commitment held no deadline Concord the European confederation for relief and development described the pledge as vague and nonbinding and said 2020 should be the new deadline

The EUs Agenda for Change

The European Commissions development strategy  Agenda for Change  puts inclusive and sustainable growth for human development at its centre Adopted in 2011 it adopted 2 reforms designed to make its development policy both more strategic and more targeted The Agenda for Change made new policies and rules for budget support The three main elements of this Agenda were

1 Targeting and concentrating aid

3 Other reforms for effectiveness  joint programming common results framework innovative financing such as blending loans and grants and Policy Coherence for Development

Programming the 11th European Development Fund

The EU is currently implementing its 11th European Development Fund for the period 20142020 with an aid budget of 305 billion for many of the ACP countries and Overseas Countries and Territories OCTs covering both national and regional programmes Effectively programming the European Development Fund EDF is a major political policy and bureaucratic challenge involving multiple stakeholders namely the European Commission EC the European External Action Service EEAS 28 EU member states the European Parliament 74 governments from the Africa Caribbean and Pacific ACP group of states and domestic accountability actors

Understanding the magnitude of the 11th EDF programming challenge is critical for three reasons

1 The 11th EDF unfolds in a radically changed global context for development cooperation as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals SDGs were agreed in September 2015

2 The 11th EDF is the last before the Cotonou Partnership Agreement CPA between the EU and the countries of the ACP expires in 2020

3 Programming and implementing the 11th EDF is a critical test of EU institutions that deal with external action and it tests the ability of EU development policy to achieve highimpact aid at a time when showing value for money is a high political priority at a time when many European governments follow a policy of fiscal austerity

Independent research by the European Centre for Development Policy Management ECDPM a think tank based in Maastricht The Netherlands shows that the EU has ensured the effective translation into practice of two key policy commitments of the Agenda for Change  namely a more focused strategy for less developed countries LDCs and lowincome countries LICs and the concentration of EU aid on a limited number of sectors and policy priorities Their research found that the high degree of compliance was achieved through toplevel support and tight control from headquarters

While the principles of the Agenda for Change appear to have been followed ECDPM showed that in many countries initial programming proposals based on incountry consultations managed by EU Delegations were then superseded by the choices of EU headquarters in Brussels Although the 11th EDF is closely aligned with national development plans there is evidence that this topdown approach to programming has led to a significant erosion of key aid and development effectiveness principles in particular country ownership

Critics have compared the album with the key free jazz recordings Ornette Colemans earlier  and John Coltranes subsequent Ascension John Litweiler regards it favourably in comparison because of its free motion of tempo often slow usually fast of ensemble density players enter and depart at will of linear movement Ekkehard Jost places it in the same company and comments on extraordinarily intensive giveandtake by the musicians and a breadth of variation and differentiation on all musical levels

Felixstowe F2
The Felixstowe F2 was a 1917 British flying boat class designed and developed by Lieutenant Commander John Cyril Porte RN at the naval air station Felixstowe during the First World War adapting a larger version of his superior Felixstowe F1 hull design married with the larger Curtiss H12 flying boat The Felixstowe hull had superior water contacting attributes and became a key base technology in most seaplane designs thereafter

Before the war Porte had worked with American aircraft designer Glenn Curtiss on a flying boat America in which they intended to cross the Atlantic in order to win the 10000 prize offered by the British Daily Mail newspaper for the first aircraft to cross the Atlantic Following the outbreak of war in Europe Porte returned to England and rejoined the Royal Navy eventually becoming commander of the naval air station at Felixstowe where he recommended the purchase from Curtiss of an improved version of the America flying boat on which he had worked the Curtiss H4 type resulting in the RNAS receiving two prototype Americas and 62 H4s

The Curtiss H4 was found to have a number of problems being both underpowered and having a hull too weak for sustained operations and having poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off One flying boat pilot Major Theodore Douglas Hallam wrote that they were comic machines weighing well under two tons with two comic engines giving when they functioned 180 horsepower and comic control being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide

To try to resolve the H4s hydrodynamic issues in 1915 Porte carried out a series of experiments on four H4s fitted with a variety of modified hulls using the results of these tests to design a new hull which was fitted to the wings and tail of an H4 serial number 3580 with a pair of 150hp 112kW HispanoSuiza 8 engines as the Felixstowe F1 Rather than the lightweight boattype structure of the Curtiss boats the F1s hull was based around a sturdy wooden boxgirder similar to that used in contemporary landplanes to which were attached a singlestep planing bottom and side sponsons Once modified by the fitting of a further two steps the new hull proved to give much better take off and landing characteristics and was much more seaworthy

Porte then designed a similar hull for the larger Curtiss H12 flying boat which while larger and more capable than the H4s shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling The combination of the new Porte II hull this time fitted with two steps with the wings of the H12 a new tail and powered by two RollsRoyce Eagle engines was named the Felixstowe F2 its first flight was in July 1916 proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which it was based The F2 entered production as the Felixstowe F2A being used as a patrol aircraft with about 100 being completed by the end of World War I Another seventy were built and these were followed by two F2C which were built at Felixstowe

In February 1917 the first prototype of the Felixstowe F3 was flown This was larger and heavier than the F2 giving it greater range and heavier bomb load but poorer agility Approximately 100 Felixstowe F3s were produced before the end of the war

The Felixstowe F5 was intended to combine the good qualities of the F2 and F3 with the prototype first flying in May 1918 The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F3 in order to ease production giving lower performance than either the F2A or F3

The Felixstowe F2A was used as a patrol aircraft over the North Sea until the end of the war Its excellent performance and maneuverability made it an effective and popular type often fighting enemy patrol and fighter aircraft as well as hunting Uboats and Zeppelins The larger F3 which was less popular with its crews than the more maneuverable F2A served in the Mediterranean and the North Sea

The F5 did not enter service until after the end of World War I but replaced the earlier Felixstowe boats together with Curtiss flying boats to serve as the RAFs standard flying boat until being replaced by the Supermarine Southampton in 1925

A scion of famous rabbinic families on both his fathers and his mothers side his family can be traced back to Maharam Padua and Saul Wahl Avraham Yehoshua Heshel showed great promise even at an early age Acquiring fame as a talmudic scholar he studied under Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk and Rabbi Yechiel Michl of Zlotchov Becoming one of the foremost spokesmen of the growing Chasidic movement in Poland he began his career as Rabbi of Kolbuszowa In 1800 he accepted the post of Rabbi of Apt or Opatw Although he held many other rabbinic positions to the chasidim he remained always the Apter Rov In 1808 he was chosen as Rabbi of Iai Moldavia In the wake of communal strife there he was forced to leave his post and settled in Mezhbizh the home of the Baal Shem Tov and the cradle of Hasidism where he devoted himself completely to the study and dissemination of Chasidism

It was during this period in his life in Mezhbizh that he gained the veneration of thousands of followers among whom were a number of the prominent rabbis of the age His outstanding character trait was his strongly expressed love of the Jewish people which earned him the title of Oheiv Yisrael Lover of Israel Oheiv Yisrael became the title of the published collection of his thoughts arranged according to the weekly Torah portions The work abounds with lofty kabbalistic insights and interpretations It is one of the basic chasidic texts and bespeaks the Apter Rovs passionate love of his fellow Jews The Apter Rov is one of the most notable and beloved luminaries in the hasidic firmament

On his deathbed crying bitterly over the long exile he said Before his demise Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berdichev promised that upon entering the WorldtoCome he would not rest or sit until Mashiach would come But they diverted his attention by teaching him lofty and mystical concepts until he forgot his pledgebut I assure you I will not forget

He was buried in Mezhbizh near the Baal Shem Tov An ornate stone ohel marks his grave in the old Jewish cemetery According to one hasidic legend angels subsequently carried his body and buried him in the Holy Land and in the Jewish Cemetery in Tiberias there is a stone marking his supposed grave

Paul Buff engineered the original demo recording of Pipeline by The Chantays and Wipe Out by The Surfaris using his unique custom built recording machine which recorded 5 tracks on 12inch recording tape Buff went on to invent the Kepex an acronym for KEyable Program EXpander the opposite of an audio compressor Paul Buffs Alison Research studio products became common on pop recordings Alan Parsons would use a Kepexed drum sound to create the heartbeat heard on Pink Floyds The Dark Side of the Moon

In 2012 Crossfire Productions in partnership with Buff released a 5CDr collection containing 156 of Buffs PAL recordings entitled Paul Buff Presents Highlights From The Pal And Original Sound Studio Archives The collection featured 58 Zappainvolved recordings including an early version of Why Dont You Do Me Right which later appeared in 1967 as the Aside of a Mothers Of Invention single and the previously unreleased Zappa novelty song My Masked Grandma

F2c
f2c is a program to convert Fortran 77 to C code developed at Bell Laboratories The standalone f2c program was based on the core of the first complete Fortran 77 compiler to be implemented the f77 program by Feldman and Weinberger Because the f77 compiler was itself written in C and relied on a C compiler back end to complete its final compilation step it and its derivatives like f2c were much more portable than compilers generating machine code directly

The f2c program was released as free software and subsequently became one of the most common means to compile Fortran code on many systems where native Fortran compilers were unavailable or expensive Several large Fortran libraries such as LAPACK were made available as C libraries via conversion with f2c The f2c program also influenced the development of the GNU g77 compiler which uses a modified version of the f2c runtime libraries

Ohio State Route 372
State Route 372 SR372 is a very short twolane eastwest state highway in the southern part of the US state of Ohio The western terminus of this spur route is at a Tintersection with the concurrency of US Route 23 US23 and SR104 about north of Waverly Its eastern terminus is just to the east of that point at the boundary of Scioto Trail State Forest Continuing east of that point is Stoney Creek Road which traverses through the state forest in the direction of the Scioto River From its inception in the middle of the 1930s the primary function of SR372 has been to provide access to the state forest from the state highway system

The entirety of SR372 is located within Franklin Township in rural southern Ross County Beginning at a Tintersection with the US23SR104 concurrency SR372 travels easterly into a series of curves in the shape of an S taking the route to the north and then bending to the southeast As it passes amidst heavily wooded terrain with some houses alongside the roadway SR372 travels past an intersection with North Ridge Road then abruptly comes to an end as it crosses the western boundary of Scioto Trail State Forest The roadway continues eastward from this point as Stoney Creek Road

The Ohio Department of Transportation ODOT regularly does surveys to determine the amount of traffic that utilizes its highway system Commonly the volumes measured in these surveys are expressed in terms average annual daily traffic AADT or the amount of traffic volume on a given segment of a highway on any average day of the year In 2010 ODOT determined that an average of 340passenger vehicles per day and 20commercial vehicles per day used SR372 This state route is not a part of the National Highway System a network of roadways identified as being most important for the economy mobility and defense of the nation

The SR372 designation was established in 1934 Throughout its entire history the highway has served to provide a connection to Scioto Trail State Forest from US23 When it was first designated all of SR372 was gravelsurfaced The state route was paved by 1958

Egypt at the 1984 Winter Olympics
Egypt competed in the Winter Olympic Games for the first and only time at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo Yugoslavia Its only participant was alpine skier Jamil El Reedy who competed in three disciplines but did not win a medal

Prior to 1984 Egypt had sent athletes to eleven editions of the Summer Olympic Games three times as the United Arab Republic the 1906 Intercalated Games and equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics The 1984 Winter Games were Egypts first and only appearance at the Winter Olympics The nation entered one athlete Jamil ElReedy to the alpine skiing tournament where he competed in three disciplines but failed to win a medal

ElReedy was born in Cairo to an Egyptian father and an American mother who taught English at the American University in Cairo He moved to Plattsburgh New York when his family left Egypt following the SixDay War Coached by his father he became a successful skier in high school training on Whiteface Mountain He was selected to represent Egypt at the 1984 Games at the age of 18 despite never having competed internationally and in preparation spent 40 days in an Egyptian cave filled with snakes and scorpions to strengthen his mental resolve At the Games he competed in three events with his best placement being 46th out of 101 entrants in the mens slalom He was also 60th out of 61 participants in the mens downhill finishing over a minute behind the penultimate finisher Greeces Lazaros Arkhontopoulos and failed to finish the mens giant slalom after a fall on the first run

Maldivian Coast Guard
The Maldivian Coast Guard is the naval or maritime arm of the Maldivian National Defence Force MNDF Because the Maldives does not have a navy the MNDF Coast Guard functions as the armed maritime force of the nation with a charter to contribute to national defence and by and large to respond to issues related to the maritime security of the nation Therefore the Coast Guard is documented as the custodian of the Maldives Maritime Domain Maritime security is a constituent ingredient of the national security in a maritime nation such as the Maldives and its significance is best understood when one perceives the island or the archipelagic nature of the country

After the new government took power in 2008 the Coast Guard has been the highest priority of the defense sector in Maldives Four Coast Guard squadrons are deployed in the southern central and northern regions of Maldives and a Strategic Reserve has been established at the capital Male


The roots of the MNDF Coast Guard lie in the 1570s Kalhuoffummi as its insignia symbolizes the legendary sailing boat used by the heroic Mohamed Thakurufaanu and his allies in his guerrilla battle to free the country from the invasion of the Portuguese Until the establishment of the modern Coast Guard in 1980 the small speed boat section of the National Security Service was the maritime security service in the Maldives and it lays claim on being the Maldives oldest continuous seagoing force The Coast Guard was established as a separate wing of the defence forces on 1 January 1980 with the late Colonel Hussain Fulhu as its first Commanding Officer The Maldivian Coast Guard Air Elements was formed as the air wing of the Coast Guard in 1978 with one HAL Do 228 donated by India In 2003 India Donated two HAL Dhruvs

The MNDF Coast Guard has a dual role with the strategic military application settling within the parameters of national defence and territorial integrity as the primary task while its secondary role is aimed at relatively non military aspects of maritime security which covers areas such as maritime terrorism transnational crime drug trafficking through maritime routes smuggling piracy and so forth In times of peace Coast Guard is popular as a force of goodwill due to its endeavours in building bridges of friendship with the public It reaches out to people and save their lives by intensely conducting well planned and executed Search and Rescue SAR operations at sea and assume other humanitarian roles in crises when the public is in need

Whilst most other military services of the MNDF are either at standby or training for the unseen hostile actions the Coast Guard is deployed every day With decentralized Coast Guard squadrons placed at Area Commands in North Central and South of Maldives and a strategic reserve at the capital Male under the new Strategic Defence Directive and much responsibility placed on even the most junior sailors the Coast Guard is frequently lauded for its quick responsiveness and adaptability in a broad range of tasks and emergencies

Its capabilities were strengthened and modernised after the 3 November 1988 attack by Peoples Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam terrorists

After the 1988 incident 6 British patrol craft were acquired These were 4 Tracker II class 1 Dagger class and 1 Cheverton class ships In 1998 3 vessels were built at the Colombo Dockyard These are 2 Coastal Surveillance Vessels of 24 meters CGS Ghazee and CGS Iskandhar and 1 Fast Landing Craft of 20 metres length The CGS also acquired a 17meter fire fighting vessel

After the 2004 tsunami the need for larger vessels with offshore patrol capabilities were given a high priority The Indian Navy donated a Trinkat class patrol vessel of 46 metres length in April 2006 commissioned as CGS Huravee and is commanded by Lieutenant Mohamed Jamshad Lt Jamshad had been the executive officer of CGS Huravee

The Maldives Coast Guard has acquired two additional large offshore patrol craft constructed at the Colombo Dockyard Sri Lanka These vessels are 42m and 35m in length The 35m patrol craft was brought to Male on 21 April 2007 and commissioned as CGS Shaheedh Ali commanded by Lieutenant Moahmed Fahumy Lt Mohamed Fahumy was previously the executive officer of CGS Shaheed AliThe 42m vessel was brought to Male on 11 November 2007 and commissioned as CGS Ghaazee It is commanded by Lieutenant Ahmed Fathih Lt Fathih was previously the executive officer of CGS Ghaazee

The Ghazee was renamed CGS Nooradheen after the Sultan who founded the Maldivian armed forces on 21 April 1892 In addition to these the Coast Guard operates some small inshore patrol craft


The MNDF coast guard has been vastly successful in securing after the modernization and expansion of their fleet Counterterrorist operations antipiracy missions search and rescue operations as well as humanitarian operations 

MNDF coast guard has successfully taken down pirate ships illegally entering the EEZ of the Maldives mostly from Somalia Almost every year the coast guard has been able to arrest and apprehend roughly 200450 pirates and prevent illegal entries into the Maldivian territory in the past years

On 17th May of 2007 a gun running ship that was carrying mortar bombs and guns while illegally intruding the EEZ of the Maldivian territory fired upon a Maldivian fishing vessel The Maldivian fishing vessel quickly informed the Maldives Coast Guard which resulted in a standoff between the Tamil Tigers gun runner boat and CGS Huravee of the coast guard After repetitive attempts to make them surrender with peaceful negotiations the boat still refused to comply and attempted to take offensive action against the coast guard With little choice left the coast guard ship CGS Huravee fired upon the boat and sank it

<doc id="7729151" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7729151" title="Threetier education">
Threetier education
Threetier education refers to those structures of schooling which exist in some parts of England where pupils are taught in three distinct school types A similar system was trialled in Scotland

In a threetier authorities children begin their compulsory education in a first school Sometimes also called a lower school or more simply primary school these schools cater for children aged up to an age between 8 and 10 and cover all of Key Stage 1 and the first years of Key Stage 2 Children then transfer to a Middle school These schools cater for children during a period of 3 to 4 years between the ages of 8 and 14 depending on the local authority These years cover parts of both Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 Following this children transfer to a high school sometimes known as an upper school for the remainder of their compulsory education and sometimes on into the sixth form

Many local authorities trialled systems as this for a period from as early as 1968 with many more following suit during the early 1970s particularly in 1972 when the raising of school leaving age in England and Wales from 15 to 16 saw many secondary schools lacking the adequate class space for 11 to 16yearolds

However most have since reverted to align their schools to the National Curriculum

Some LEAs reverted to the traditional age ranges as long ago as the late 1970s One of the first areas to revert to the traditional age ranges was Halesowen in the West Midlands which abandoned 59 first 913 middle and 131618 secondary schools in 1982 after just 10 years in use

No local authorities now maintain an exclusively threetier structure A number of authorities have a mix of standard twotier and threetier provision with middle schools Central Bedfordshire Worcestershire and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Berkshire Leicestershire operates a threetier system in some areas with children moving from primary school into secondary school after year six and then to upper school after year nine

In 2006 it was reported that Central Bedfordshire Northumberland and the Isle of Wight were the only LEAs still exclusively using the threetier system The London Borough of Harrow the city of Oxford and the counties of Dorset Norfolk Suffolk and Worcestershirelook up Bromsgrove and redditch largely used the system until the 2000s and their middle schools were either closed or converted to primary schools catering to children up to age 11

A threetier system also exists in Gibraltar

Presently the 13 intake mostly exists in the independent sector although some have followed their respective LEAs and adopted the 11 intake

The main routes through education are shown in the diagram below with threetier routes being shown in blue and mauve

PHP accelerator
A PHP accelerator is a PHP extension designed to improve the performance of software applications written in the PHP programming language

Most PHP accelerators work by caching the compiled opcodebytecode of PHP representation of php files to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling source code on each request some or even most of which may never be executed To further improve performance the cached code is stored in shared memory and directly executed from there minimizing the amount of slow disk reads and memory copying at runtime

PHP accelerators substantially increase the speed of PHP applications Improvements of web page generation throughput by factors of two to seven have been observed

The effect on application performance of opcode caching varies widely depending on factors such as the inherent execution time of the PHP application and the percentage of source code actually executed on a given request and whether additional optimization steps are performed While a code optimizer may even slow down overall performance when used in isolation it can provide an additional performance boost when coupled with a bytecode cache as the optimization effort is performed just once

Josh Fields infielder
Joshua Dean Fields born December 14 1982 is an American former professional baseball infielder He was selected as the 18th overall pick in the first round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft by the Chicago White Sox He has played in Major League Baseball for the White Sox and Kansas City Royals and in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Yomiuri Giants

Fields was a twosport athlete at Oklahoma State University playing both baseball and football He was selected as a Big 12 Conference AllStar at third base in  and had a career batting average of 364 over three years Fields also earned three letters as a quarterback for the Cowboys He led the team to two bowl games including setting the Cotton Bowl Classic record with 307 passing yards against the University of Mississippi

Entering  Fields was ranked as the fourthbest prospect in the White Sox organization and the 95thbest prospect in Major League Baseball by Baseball America He hit safely in 14 straight games from August 6  August 21 for the Birmingham Barons tied for the eighthlongest streak in the Southern League

Prior to the season Fields was once again ranked as the fourthbest prospect in the White Sox organization by Baseball America He homered in four consecutive games from May 11  May 14 with the Charlotte Knights and was selected to play in the AllStar Futures Game at Pittsburghs PNC Park Fields made his major league debut on September 13  but did not record his first major league atbat until September 18 In that game against the Detroit Tigers Fields hit a pinchhit home run off Detroits Jamie Walker He became the third player in White Sox history to hit a home run in his first major league atbat joining Carlos Lee May 7  and Miguel Olivo September 15  as the only other White Sox to do so

Fields entered the season ranked as the secondbest prospect in the White Sox organization and the 45thbest prospect in Major League Baseball by Baseball America Although he started the season at TripleA Charlotte he was called up to the White Sox after a season ending back injury to third basemam Joe Crede He recorded his first multihome run game on August 10 against the Seattle Mariners hitting both off starter Jarrod Washburn On August 26  Fields made his first start in left field though he only played 21 games at that position before being moved back to third base

Fields ended his first season as a Major Leaguer by hitting a promising 244 23 home runs 67 RBI and an OPS of 788 in 100 games His 23 home runs tied him with Bill Melton for 3rd most home runs by a White Sox player in their rookie season Melton did that in 157 games Fields received one thirdplace vote for AL Rookie of the Year

Entering spring training for the season Fields was expected to be the starting third baseman with Joe Crede likely traded However Crede arrived at camp fully recovered from his injury and White Sox general manager Kenny Williams was said to be unsatisfied with the trade offers This resulted in Crede being given the starting job and Fields once again beginning the season in TripleA Charlotte Fields had a disappointing injuryriddled season with the Knights in which he regressed to a 246 batting average and 772 OPS

On July 25 2008 he was called up to play with the White Sox after Crede was put on the 15day disabled list Fields underwent arthroscopic knee surgery at the end of the 2008 season and was the White Soxs starting third baseman in until Gordon Beckham was recalled from TripleA Charlotte on June 4 and took the position 
On July 23 2009 in a game against the Tampa Bay Rays Fields hit a grand slam in his first plate appearance of the game This would later end up being the gamewinning home run in Mark Buehrles perfect game over the Tampa Bay Rays winning 50 Fields also caught the final out of the perfect game a groundout to White Sox shortstop Alexei Ramrez Six days later he would be demoted to Triple A Charlotte to make room for newly acquired Mark Kotsay

On November 6 2009 Fields along with Chris Getz was traded by the White Sox to the Kansas City Royals in exchange for Mark Teahen He played in 13 games for the Royals hitting 306 during the 2010 season

On December 20 2010 Fields was signed to a minor league contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates
However on March 28 he was traded by the Pirates to the Colorado Rockies at the conclusion of spring training for either a player to be named later or cash considerations He recorded a 365 batting average with the TripleA Colorado Springs Sky Sox before being released on June 28 in order to pursue a career in Japan

Fields signed with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan on June 28 2011 In 40 games in Japan he hit only 202

He signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 4 2012 After failing to win a spot on the Dodgers opening day roster he was assigned to the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes He played in 133 games for the Isotopes with a 322 average with 13 homers and 71 RBI

Fields signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in late November 2012 according to Baseball America

It was a colony founded by the Epizephyrian Locrians and is said to have derived its name from an adjoining fountain But though it is repeatedly noticed among the Greek cities in this part of Italy it does not appear ever to have attained to any great power or importance It is probable however that the Medimnaeans  who are noticed by Diodorus as contributing a body of colonists to the repeopling of Messana modern Messina by Dionysius in 396BCE are no other than the Medmaeans and that we should read in the passage in question Though never a very conspicuous place Medma seems to have survived the fall of many other more important cities of Magna Graecia and it is noticed as a still existing town both by Strabo and Pliny the Elder But the name is not found in Ptolemy and all subsequent trace of it disappears It appears from Strabo that the town itself was situated a little inland and that it had a port or emporium on the seashore

The name of Mesima is still borne by a river which flows into the sea a little below Nicotera in the neighbourhood Nicotera the name of which is already found in the Antonine Itinerary probably arose after the decline of Mesma

<doc id="7729277" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7729277" title="Random digit dialing">
Random digit dialing
Random digit dialing RDD is a method for selecting people for involvement in telephone statistical surveys by generating telephone numbers at random Random digit dialing has the advantage that it includes unlisted numbers that would be missed if the numbers were selected from a phone book In populations where there is a high telephoneownership rate it can be a cost efficient way to get complete coverage of a geographic area

RDD is widely used for statistical surveys including election opinion polling and selection of experimental control groups

An important consideration in random digit dialing surveys is bias introduced by nonresponders Nonresponse bias can be a problem if responders differ from nonresponders for the measured variables For example nonresponders may not have been contacted because they work multiple minimumwage jobs Various techniques are used to reduce the nonresponse rate such as multiple call attempts monetary incentives advance letters and leaving messages on answering machines because reducing the nonresponse rate may directly reduce nonresponse bias In addition when trying to calculate total error estimates response rate calculations can be imprecise because it can be difficult to determine whether certain telephone numbers are interviewable

When the desired coverage area matches up closely enough with country codes and area codes random digits can be chosen within the desired area codes In cases where the desired region doesnt match area codes for instance electoral districts surveys must rely on telephone databases and must rely on selfreported address information for unlisted numbers Increasing use of mobile phones although there are currently techniques which allow infusion of wireless phones into the RDD sampling frame number portability and VoIP have begun to decrease the ability for RDD to target specific areas within a country and achieve complete coverage

<doc id="7729301" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7729301" title="DebyeHckel theory">
DebyeHckel theory
The DebyeHckel theory was proposed by Peter Debye and Erich Hckel as a theoretical explanation for departures from ideality in solutions of electrolytes and plasmas It is a linearized PoissonBoltzmann model which assumes an extremely simplified model of electrolyte solution but nevertheless gave accurate predictions of mean activity coefficients for ions in dilute solution The DebyeHckel equation provides a starting point for modern treatments of nonideality of electrolyte solutions

In the chemistry of electrolyte solutions an ideal solution is a solution whose colligative properties are proportional to the concentration of the solute Real solutions show departures from this kind of ideality at all but the very lowest concentrations see for example Raoults law In order to accommodate these effects in the thermodynamics of solutions the concept of activity was introduced the properties are then proportional to the activities of the ions Activity a is proportional to concentration c The proportionality constant is known as an activity coefficient formula1
In an ideal electrolyte solution the activity coefficients of all the ions are equal to one Ideality of electrolyte solution can be achieved only in very dilute solutions Nonideality of more concentrated solutions arises principally but not exclusively because ions of opposite charge attract each other due to electrostatic forces while ions of the same charge repel each other In consequence ions are not randomly distributed throughout the solution as they would be in an ideal solution

Activity coefficients of single ions cannot be measured experimentally because an electrolyte solution must contain both positively charged ions and negatively charged ions Instead a mean activity coefficient formula3 is defined For example with the electrolyte NaCl

In general the mean activity coefficient of a fully dissociated electrolyte of formula AB is given by

Activity coefficients are themselves functions of concentration as the amount of interionic interaction increases as the concentration of the electrolyte increases Debye and Hckel developed a theory with which single ion activity coefficients could be calculated By calculating the mean activity coefficients from them the theory could be tested against experimental data It was found to give excellent agreement for dilute solutions

A description of DebyeHckel theory includes a very detailed discussion of the assumptions and their limitations as well as the mathematical development and applications

A snapshot of a 2dimensional section of an idealized electrolyte solution is shown in the picture The ions are shown as spheres with unit electrical charge The solvent pale blue is shown as a uniform medium without structure On average each ion is surrounded more closely by ions of opposite charge than by ions of like charge These concepts were developed into a quantitative theory involving ions of charge ze and ze where z can be any integer The principal assumption is that departure from ideality is due to electrostatic interactions between ions mediated by Coulombs law the force of interaction between two electric charges separated by a distance r in a medium of relative permittivity  is given by

It is also assumed that

The last assumption means that each cation is surrounded by a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions The cloud has a net negative charge Similarly each anion is surrounded by a cloud with net positive charge

The deviation from ideality is taken to be a function of the potential energy resulting from the electrostatic interactions between ions and their surrounding clouds To calculate this energy two steps are needed

The first step is to specify the electrostatic potential for ion j by means of Poissons equation
r is the total potential at a distance r from the central ion and r is the averaged charge density of the surrounding cloud at that distance To apply this formula it is essential that the cloud has spherical symmetry that is the charge density is a function only of distance from the central ion as this allows the Poisson equation to be cast in terms of spherical coordinates with no angular dependence

The second step is to calculate the charge density by means of a Boltzmann distribution

where k is Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature This distribution also depends on the potential r and this introduces a serious difficulty in terms of the superposition principle Nevertheless the two equations can be combined to produce the PoissonBoltzmann equation

Solution of this equation is far from straightforward Debye and Hckel expanded the exponential as a truncated Taylor series to first order The zeroth order term vanishes because the solution is on average electrically neutral so that  n z  0 which leaves us with only the first order term The result has the form of the Helmholtz equation

which has an analytical solution This equation applies to electrolytes with equal numbers of ions of each charge Nonsymmetrical electrolytes require another term with  For symmetrical electrolytes this reduces to the modified spherical Bessel equation

The coefficients formula12 and formula13 are fixed by the boundary conditions As formula14 formula15 must not diverge so formula16 At formula17 which is the distance of the closest approach of ions the force exerted by the charge should be balanced by the force of other ions imposing formula18 from which formula12 is found yielding

The electrostatic potential energy formula21 of the ion at formula22 is

This is the potential energy of a single ion in a solution The multiplecharge generalization from electrostatics gives an expression for the potential energy of the entire solution see also DebyeHckel equation The mean activity coefficient is given by the logarithm of this quantity as follows see also Extensions of the theory

where I is the ionic strength and a is a parameter that represents the distance of closest approach of ions For aqueous solutions at 25C A  051moldm and B  329nmmoldm

The most significant aspect of this result is the prediction that the mean activity coefficient is a function of ionic strength rather than the electrolyte concentration For very low values of the ionic strength the value of the denominator in the expression above becomes nearly equal to one In this situation the mean activity coefficient is proportional to the square root of the ionic strength This is known as the DebyeHckel limiting law

This equation for formula27 gives satisfactory agreement with experimental measurements for low electrolyte concentrations typically less than 10 molL Deviations from the theory occur at higher concentrations and with electrolytes that produce ions of higher charges particularly unsymmetrical electrolytes Essentially these deviations occur because the model is hopelessly oversimplified so there is little to be gained making small adjustments to the model The individual assumptions can be challenged in turn
Moreover ionic radius is assumed to be negligible but at higher concentrations the ionic radius becomes comparable to the radius of the ionic atmosphere
Most extensions to DebyeHckel theory are empirical in nature They usually allow the DebyeHckel equation to be followed at low concentration and add further terms in some power of the ionic strength to fit experimental observations The main extensions are the Davies equation Pitzer equations and specific ion interaction theory

The theory can be applied also to dilute solutions of mixed electrolytes Freezing point depression measurements has been used to this purpose

The treatment given so far is for a system not subject to an external electric field When conductivity is measured the system is subject to an oscillating external field due to the application of an AC voltage to electrodes immersed in the solution Debye and Hckel modified their theory in 1926 and their theory was further modified by Lars Onsager in 1927 All the postulates of the original theory were retained In addition it was assumed that the electric field causes the charge cloud to be distorted away from spherical symmetry After taking this into account together with the specific requirements of moving ions such as viscosity and electrophoretic effects Onsager was able to derive a theoretical expression to account for the empirical relation known as Kohlrauschs Law for the molar conductivity 
formula29 is known as the limiting molar conductivity K is an empirical constant and c is the electrolyte concentration Limiting here means at the limit of the infinite dilution
Onsagers expression is
where A and B are constants that depend only on known quantities such as temperature the charges on the ions and the dielectric constant and viscosity of the solvent This is known as the DebyeHckelOnsager equation However this equation only applies to very dilute solutions and has been largely superseded by other equations due to Fuoss and Onsager 1932 and 1957 and later

Axel Lindahl
Axel Theodor Lindahl 27 July 1841  11 December 1906 was a Swedish photographer notable for his early photography of Norwegian landscapes

Lindahl was born in Mariestad in southwestern Sweden With his brother Udo he opened his own photography studio in Uddevalla in 1865 within one year his work was exhibited in museums By around 1867 he had moved his business to Gothenburg Once established there he extended his interest to landscape photography focusing initially on the Swedish west coast and then moving into Norway In 1883 he sold his interest in the studio in Sweden and made Norwegian landscapes his exclusive area of business working closely with the publisher Rich Andvord

Unlike many of his contemporary photographers who emphasized the dramatic nature of Norwegian landscapes Lindahl sought in his composition the harmonious aesthetic of his subject matter

He remained active throughout the 19th century and left over 3500 negative plates These were taken over by Anders Beer Wilse and were passed through several owners until the Norwegian government took them over in 1991 and placed them in the archives of Norsk Folkemuseum in Oslo

The Fabulous Clipjoint first published in book form in 1947 originally published under the title Dead Mans Indemnity in Mystery Book Magazine April 1946 is the first fulllength novel by writer Fredric Brown who had honed his craft by publishing hundreds of short stories in the pulp magazines of the day The Fabulous Clipjoint is also the first of seven detective novels featuring the nephewuncle team of Ed and Am Hunter The subsequent novels in the series are The Dead Ringer The Bloody Moonlight Compliments of a Fiend Death Has Many Doors The Late Lamented and Mrs Murphys Underpants

When teenaged Ed Hunters alcoholic father is murdered Ed is for all intents and purposes orphaned as he feels little affection for his meanspirited stepmother and hypersexual stepsister The police dismiss the case as nothing more than the random murder of a backalley drunk and so Ed decides to investigate the crime on his own

Ed enlists the help of his fathers brother Ambrose Am Hunter an itinerant carny whom he has not seen in many years and the two of them set out to solve the crime Together they wade through a swamp of unseemly characters of the Chicago underworld to expose the real murderer of Eds father Along the way with Ams guidance Ed comes to realize that his father was not the hapless pathetic man he had always believed him to be

The Fabulous Clipjoint like most of Browns works is notable for its solid craftsmanship atmosphere and suspense In 1948 it received the Edgar Award for Best First Novel which marks the only occasion Brown was nominated for the award

Global Justice or Global Revenge
Global Justice or Global Revenge International Criminal Justice at the Crossroads 2003 is a book by Austrian philosopher Hans Kchler who was appointed by the United Nations as observer of the Lockerbie bombing trial in the Netherlands 20002002 Turkish and Indian editions of the book were published in 2005 an Arabic edition was published in 2011

The book deals with the evolving concept of universal jurisdiction the doctrine of humanitarian intervention legal questions of international terrorism and whether international criminal justice can at all be practiced in the absence of a global balance of power The book analyzes the various international criminal courts since Nuremberg and provides a critical assessment of the prospects of the International Criminal Court It challenges the assumption of established legal theory in which the normative framework of criminal justice can be abstracted from actual power relations and offers elements of a new doctrine on the dialectical relationship between power and law

The gradual assertion of the International Criminal Courts authority will be the test case for the separation of powers which is the indispensable requirement of the rule of law whether at the national or international level Only a fully independent international court will guarantee that a system of global justice associated with universal jurisdiction will not turn into a system of global revenge where political interests not the principles of impartiality and fairness determine the practice of international criminal law

Persian calligraphy
Persian calligraphy  or Iranian calligraphy  is the calligraphy of the Persian language It is one of the most revered arts throughout history of Iran

After the introduction of Islam in the 7th century Persians adapted the Arabic alphabet to Persian and developed the contemporary Persian alphabet The Arabic alphabet has 28 characters An additional four letters were added by Iranians httpwwwpersiancalligraphyorgHistoryofCalligraphyhtml 2nowikinowiki which resulted in the 32 letters currently present in the Persian alphabet

Around one thousand years ago Ibn Muqlah  and his brother created six genres of Iranian calligraphy namely Mohaqiq Reyhan Sols Naskh Toqi and Reqa These genres were common for four centuries in Persia In the 7th century Hijri calendar Hassan Farsi Kateb combined the Naskh and Reqah styles and invented a new genre of Persian calligraphy named Taliq In the 14th century Mir Ali Tabrizi combined two major scripts of his time ie Naskh and Taliq and created a new Persian calligraphic style called NastaliqhttpwwwpersiancalligraphyorgHistoryofCalligraphyhtml 2nowikinowiki In the past 500 years Nastalq also anglicized as Nastaleeq  has been the predominant style for writing the PersoArabic script

In the 17th century Morteza Gholi Khan Shamlou and Mohammad Shafi Heravi created a new genre called cursive Nastalq Shekasteh Nastalq Persian   Almost a century later AbdolMajid Taleqani who was a prominent artist at the time brought this genre to its highest level This calligraphic style is based on the same rules as Nastaliq However cursive Nastaliq has a few significant differences it provides more flexible movements and it is slightly more stretched and curved Yadollah Kaboli is one of the most prominent contemporary calligraphers within this style

In 1950 the Irans Association of Calligraphers was founded by Hossein Mirkhani Ali Akbar Kaveh Ebrahim Bouzari Hassan Mirkhani and Mehdi Baiani For an overview of Persian calligraphys development within Afghanistan see Calligraphy during last two centuries in Afghanistan 1964 by Azizuddin Vakili

 Jalil Rasouli Parviz Tanavoli and Nima Behnoud use Persian calligraphy and Rumi poetry in dress designing
abol atighetchi abolghassem uses combination of colored naskh suluth and kufic style calligraphy with large letters in a single large format acrylic painting for his work presentation and circles in gold leaf or simple color to decorate but in the nastaligh style lots of colorful geometrical forms and lines are used to modernize the painting and also the same technique is used to modernize the large format birds of bessmel   all drawn with large lettersthis style of work can be classified as post modern

Giovanni Grancino
Giovanni Grancino 16371709 son of Andrea Grancino was one of the early Milanese luthiers and may have worked with his brother Francesco

Grancinos workshops were all located on Contrada Larga now Via Larga in Milan His instruments bear the characteristic segno della corona mark of the crown

Although the luthiers of Milan created instruments of varying quality Grancinos violins violas cellos and double basses are considered superior Grancino used a varnish which was a finely textured clear yellow to pale brown color

Grancinos early instrument patterns and designs were influenced by Niccol Amati of Cremona whose impressive works influenced many Italian luthiers of the period However Grancinos later productions show flatter arching and narrower form under the influence of Stradivari Grancinos cellos tend to be larger than others yet with a clear sound characteristic of the Italian luthiers

The Grancino manufactory was continued by members of the Testore family The eldest of them Carlo Giuseppe Testore built a violin for Grancino which is now housed in the National Music Museum on the campus of the University of South Dakota

Among Grancinos students was the Milanese luthier Giovanni Vasallo

Grancinos violins play an interesting role in fiction Canadian author EmilyJane Hills Orfords born Toronto 1957 novel Spring PublishAmerica 2005 features a Grancino violin with a mystery to unravel American Harold Deckers selfpublished novel I Giulia The View Through FHoles recounts the life of his treasured Grancino violin Canadian childrens performer Peggy Hills born Toronto 1950 also featured a Grancino violin in her childrens recording Peggys Violin which was nominated for a Juno in 2007

After getting active in politics Heaton was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1855

Two years later he moved to St Anthony Falls Minnesota where he entered politics He was elected as a member of the Minnesota State Senate serving 18581863

During the American Civil War in 1863 Heaton was appointed as a special agent of the United States Treasury Department and the United States depository in New Bern North Carolina after Union troops occupied the area A contraband camp was set up near the city to begin education of former slaves for independence In 1864 he was offered the appointment as the Third Auditor of the Treasury but declined

Heaton decided to stay in North Carolina where he served as a member of its constitutional convention in 1867 under Reconstruction When the state was readmitted to representation he was elected as a Republican to the Fortieth Congress and reelected to the Fortyfirst Congress serving from July 15 1868 until his death He was chairman of the Committee on Coinage Weights and Measures Fortyfirst Congress

After his nomination as a Republican candidate for reelection to the Fortysecond Congress he died in Washington DC on June 25 1870 His body was returned to New Bern where he was interred in the National Cemetery

One Unit
The One Unit  was a geopolitical program launched by the government of Pakistan led by thenPrime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra on 22 November 1954 The program was believed to be enacted after the government faced difficulty of administrating the two unequal polities of Pakistan separated from each other by more than a thousand miles To diminish the differences between the two regions the program merged the Four Provinces of West Pakistan into a single province as was the case with East Pakistan now Bangladesh

Pakistani scholars and researchers maintain that the One Unit program was viewed as a counterbalance against the political and population domination of the ethnic Bengali population of East Pakistan The One Unit program was met with great resistance and grievances from the Four Provinces since its establishment and it remained in effect until 1970 Finally President General Yahya Khan imposed Legal Framework Order No 1970 to end the One Unit program and reinstate the provisional status of the Four Provinces as of August 1947

Although Pakistan was conceived by philosopher Sir Muhammad Iqbal in 1930 uniting the four states of the northwestern British Indian Empire the country was established on 14 August 1947 directly resulting from the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah Since then the country had been without a consolidated written constitution and all Pakistans state affairs had been run under constitutional acts of the British Indian Empire such as the Government of India Act 1935 and the Indian Independence Act 1947 

The Government had prolonged difficulty in administrating East Bengal with its border with Eastern India and the four provinces which border Western India Iran China and Afghanistan

One Unit was conceived by thenGovernorGeneral Malik Ghulam and drafting was completed by thenchief Minister Mumtaz Ali Doltana The first official announcement about it was made on 22 November 1954 Rationalizing the framework Bogra enumerated the benefits of having one unit or province There will be no Bengalis no Punjabis no Sindhis no Pathans no Balochis no Bahawalpuris no Khairpuris The disappearance of these groups will strengthen the integrity of Pakistan The Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali implemented the framework of the One Unit program on 14 October 1955 after Pakistan National Assembly passed a bill merging all of West Pakistan into a single province on 30 September 1955 

1 It would end the curse of provincial prejudices

2 It would allow the development of backward areas

3 It would reduce administrative expenses

4 It would make it easier to draw up a new constitution

5 It would give East and West Pakistan maximum autonomy

After the 1954 general election the four provinces and Tribal Areas were merged in the western wing The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore The province of East Bengal including Sylhet and the Hill Tracts was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca The federal government moved the countrys capital in 1958 from Karachi to Rawalpindi serving as provisional capital until Islamabad was ready while the federal legislature moved to Dacca

West Pakistan formed a single and united political entity but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions The One Unit policy was regarded as an administrative reform that would reduce expenditure and help eliminate ethnic and parochial prejudices However with the military coup of 1958 trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President claimed executive power over West Pakistan The province of West Pakistan was dissolved on 1 July 1970 by President General Yahya Khan

Marcellus of Tangier
Saint Marcellus of Tangier or Saint Marcellus the Centurion  c mid 3rd century  298 AD is venerated as a Martyr Saint by the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church His feast day is celebrated on October 30

Marcellus was said to have been a centurion stationed at Tingis modernday Tangiers who refused to participate in the general birthday celebrations of the Emperor Maximian which would have entailed sacrifice to the Roman gods Throwing off his military belt weapons and vine staff the insignia of his rank Marcellus was soon brought before a judge named Fortunatus The judge remanded the saint to lay his case before Maximian and Constantius the latter was friendly to Christians However Marcellus was taken to the deputy Praetorian prefect Aurelius Agricolanus instead Marcellus pleaded guilty to repudiating his allegiance to an earthly leader

Marcellus was martyred with a sword by the deputy Praetorian prefect

Afterwards it is said that the official shorthand writer a man named Saint Cassian was so angry at the sentence that he refused to record the court proceedings and was martyred as well

St Marcellus relics were later brought to and enshrined at Len and he became a patron saint of the city The Plaza de San Marcelo in this city is named for him The church of San Marcelo dates from the 10th century

An alternate version of his legend states that he was a centurion of the Legio VII Gemina Pia Felix and was born in what is now Len in the middle of the third century This version however has been shown to be largely apocryphal The story relates that Marcellus lived close to the city walls During the birthday celebrations for the Emperor Maximian in July 298 Marcellus publicly demonstrated his Christian faith by throwing down the insignia of his rank and proclaimed that he only venerated one God He was then sent to Tangiers to be judged by the viceprefect vicar Agricolanus He was condemned to death and decapitated on October 29 298 together with his wife Nona and his twelve sons Claudius Lupercus Victorius Facundus Primitivus Servandus Germanus Faustus Januarius and Martial Included in this group of sons are the martyrs Emeterius and Celedonius though their connection to Marcellus is probably apocryphal Servandus and Germanus or Cermanus were venerated separately at Cadiz and their association with Marcellus is also apocryphal

Saints Claudius Lupercus or Lupercio and Victorius or Victoricus d c 300 are said to have been the sons of St Marcellus They were said to have been martyred at Len Spain during the reign of the Emperor Diocletian Their relationship to Marcellus is probably apocryphal though it was accepted in subsequent breviaries and hagiographies as well as the Roman Martyrology which placed all four saints under October 30 However it is quite possible that Claudius Lupercus and Victorius were soldiers of Spanish origin who were killed at Len as tradition states Many churches in Spain were dedicated to them including the ancient Benedictine abbey of San Claudio in Galicia
The town of San Claudio near Oviedo takes its name from this group of martyrs

Their relics were translated several times in succeeding centuries King Ferdinand I of Castile transported some of their relics to the church of San Isidoro in Len In 1173 the relics were translated to a new church dedicated to the three martyrs This church was destroyed in 1834 and the relics were moved to the church of San Marcelo dedicated to their presumed father Their feast day is celebrated in Spain and Portugal on October 30

Victorius or Victoricus should not be confused with the French saint of the same name Another Lupercus or Luperculus was a bishop of Eauze who was venerated as a martyr and sometimes identified as an uncle of the Spanish saint Saint Engratia

Kim Wonyong
Kim Wonyong 19221993 was a South Korean archaeologist and art historian Noted in the discipline of Korean archaeology and ancient art history Yoon 2006 he was one of the first people recognized as an archaeologist in Korea to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree

Kim graduated from New York University in 1959 and was known in the latter part of his career as the Doyen of Korean Archaeology Nelson 1995 He along with others such as Kim Jeonghak Korea University Kim Jaewon Seoul National University Kim Jungbae Korea University Kim Jonggi Son Bogi Yonsei University and Lee Eunchang are pioneers of modern Korean academia who were influenced not only by the discipline of archaeology but history art history architecture and Korean philosophy

Kim began his studies at Keij Imperial University the precursor of Seoul National University SNU during the Japanese colonization of Korea 1905  1945 and graduated from there with a bachelors degree in 1945 He wrote his PhD thesis on Silla ceramics and after receiving his New York University NYU PhD Kim returned to South Korea He started as a professor at SNU in 1961 and began a long and influential career there with the exception of 19701971 when he served as the director of the National Museum of Korea Kim was a founding member of the Department of Archaeology and Ancient Art History at SNU In South Korea the academic juxtaposition of archaeology and ancient art history is partly a reflection of the status of such studies in traditional Korean and Northeast Asian culture However the mixing of the two is also a reflection of the combination of education that Kim Wonyong received at Keij Imperial University and NYU The Department of Ancient Art History and Archaeology at SNU became the main model for the establishment of similar departments at national universities across South Korea

It is difficult to overstate the importance of Kims contributions in Korean archaeology Kim Wonyong did research on all aspects and all periods of Korean prehistory and early history and can be considered as the Father of Korean Archaeology However Kim will be remembered for laying the foundation of academic archaeology symbolized by the publication in 1973 of his seminal work Hanguk Gogohak Gaeseol Introduction to Korean Archaeology This influential book was reprinted 20 times between 1973 and 1996 and remains a must on the reading list of all students of Korean prehistory and early history Kim published hundreds of articles and excavation reports over his career in Korean English and Japanese He also trained many generations of the leading archaeologists in Korea

Kim Wonyong realized the importance of Korean ancient and prehistoric cultural heritage and served as a Senior Committee member of the National Cultural Heritage Committee of Korea from 1958 to 1992 He was a great proponent of academic exchange with western archaeology and as such did research with archaeologists such as Richard J Pearson Kim was also a vocal critic of the New Archaeology Processualism from its inception in the early 1960s publishing several key letters to the editor in American Antiquity that were critical of the new theoretical movement and defended the old guard of functional and cultural historical archaeology

Kim Wonyong was also an artist He painted traditional monochromatic ink pieces multicoloured ink paintings and whimsical selfportraits Kim took the nomdeplume Sambul Hanja  to sign his paintings A true intellectual giant on the vanguard of the rebirth of the Republic of Korea in the wake of the crippling Japanese occupation of 1910  1945 and the devastating war of 1950  1953 Sambul Kim Wonyong died of cancer on November 14 1993

Deutscher Tourenwagen Cup
The Deutsche Tourenwagen Cup formerly known as ADAC Procar Series is a yearly motorsport series in Germany and some surrounding countries The series has been running since 1995

Currently the DTC is the highest level of German motorsport that runs cars to the Super 2000 regulations used in World Touring Car Championship WTCC To fill up the grid and to promote new young drivers the few Super 2000 cars are joined by the less advanced Division 2 and 3 series the Super 2000 cars being called Division 1 bringing up the total number of starting drivers to around 20 to 25 Division 1 also allows cars of BTCCspec  the 2005 champion Mathias Schlppi won in a BTCCbuilt MG ZS

As of 2016 there are 3 different classes in the DTC

The DTC have existed since 1995 as a championship for Super Production cars under the name DTC Deutsche Tourenwagen Challenge Ford and Hotfiel Sport had an important presence in the early and middle parts of the history of the series with Thomas Klenke winning the championship in 2002 The series was called the DMSB Produktionswagen Meisterschaft in 2004 and raced in two rounds of the European Touring Car Championship

The 2005 season saw the introduction of Super 2000 rules for Division 1 and the series changed its name to the DMSB Produktionswagen Meisterschaft Mathias Schlppi in a MG ZS for Maurer Motorsport was the undisputed champion winning 12 out of 16 races 2006 saw Maurer Motorsport swapping their MGs for Chevrolets and Mathias Schlppi for exBTCC driver Vincent Radermecker Schlppi instead drove for the new TFSYaco team running Toyota Corollas Vincent Radermecker would win Maurers second title while Schlppi was second in the championship

While arguably having some talented drivers and teams such as Radermecker Schlppi Maurer Motorsport and so on the DTC is very minor compared to the immensely popular DTM series

The Cry of the Wolf
The Cry of the Wolf is a novel for children or young adults written by Melvin Burgess and published by Andersen Press in 1990  Set on the island of Great Britain it features a grey wolf raised partly by humans after learning only a little from its mother before her death and the hunter who killed her who is obsessed with personally eliminating the species from the wild

The Cry of the Wolf was Burgesss first novel He was a highly commended runner up for the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association recognising the years best childrens book by a British subject

Tambourine Books published the first United States edition in 1992 Translations have been published in Danish Norwegian French Spanish Lithuanian and Slovenian languages at least

The book tells the story of a man who tries to kill the last wild wolves in England and the wolf raised among humans who will try to strike back
What if there were still wolves in England and only a few people knew it What if one of those people was an obsessive halfmad extremely able hunter who was determined to have the honour of killing the last wolf in England We are with the last wolf cubs as they are born short minutes before the slaughter begins The female survives wounded by The Hunter only long enough to teach her sole surviving cub a few skills before she too is killed by the man The cub Greycub is reared by Ben and his family and being a social animal waits in vain for the sound or scent of a remaining wolf This is not to be for he is the last wolf in England Regretfully leaving his human friends he roams for years searching for sign of his species In a bizarre but very fitting climax to the story Greycub becomes the hunter and The Hunter knows too late the feeling of the prey

This is a raw and brutal book and to be sure a cautionary tale about extinction However the focus is on obsession verging on madness Ben the boy who rears Greycub becomes an innocent betrayer of the wolves for it is he who first alerts The Hunter to the presence of the wolf pack The book reads like nonfiction with an almost detached manner but the brutality is so compelling that detachment on the part of the reader is nearly impossible In fact the feelings of readers would make for a fascinating discussion At which point did they become engaged Did they ever feel any sympathy for The Hunter How did the author do that Also there is some anthropomorphism present Could Burgess have done the book without it

Greycub  Son of Silver and Conna Main character of the story he grows up to live alone in Scotland where he kills his enemy the Hunter

Silver  Greycubs mother Her original mate was killed by the Hunter she then mated with Conna She is described as being cunning and intelligent

Conna  Father to Greycub second mate to Silver He is a skilled hunter killed just before Silver

Jenny  The Hunters trustful hunting dog she had an accident with a hyena making one of her front legs smaller than the other Killed by the Hunter for betraying him

Goldface  Silvers original mate the first kill of the Hunter

Cacoo  Connas cousin Killed by the hunter

Brindles  An old wolf in Silvers pack Killed by the Hunter

Clapper  A farm dog Killed by the Hunter when he kidnaps Greycub

Bell  Farm dog Killed by the Hunter while keeping watch with Clapper

Ben Tilley  A nice boy who tries to help Greycub for most of his life after letting slip to the hunter that there are still wild wolves in England

The Hunter  The evil man of the story he is driven into a madness to kill the last wolves He is killed by Greycub

John Tilley  Bens father and farmer at High Pond Farm

Margaret Tilley  Bens mother She is somewhat of a clean person but cares for the wolves and her family

The Breeder  The one who weans Greycub and the only one besides Ben that Greycub really respected He kept over forty deerhounds in his kennels

ACC0
ACC sometimes called ACC is a class of computational models and problems defined in circuit complexity a field of theoretical computer science The class is defined by augmenting the class AC of constantdepth alternating circuits with the ability to count the acronym ACC stands for AC with counters Specifically a problem belongs to ACC if it can be solved by polynomialsize constantdepth circuits of unbounded fanin gates including gates that count modulo a fixed integer ACC corresponds to computation in any solvable monoid The class is very well studied in theoretical computer science because of the algebraic connections and because it is one of the largest concrete computational models for which computational impossibility results socalled circuit lower bounds can be proved

Informally ACC models the class of computations realised by Boolean circuits of constant depth and polynomial size where the circuit gates includes modular counting gates that compute the number of true inputs modulo some fixed constant

More formally a language belongs to ACm if it can be computed by a family of circuits C C  where C takes n inputs the depth of every circuit is constant the size of C is a polynomial function of n and the circuit uses the following gates AND gates and OR gates of unbounded fanin computing the conjunction and disjunction of their inputs NOT gates computing the negation of their single input and unbounded fanin MODm gates which compute 1 if the number of input 1s is a multiple of m A language belongs to ACC if it belongs to ACm for some m

In some texts ACC refers to a hierarchy of circuit classes with ACC at its lowest level where the circuits in ACC have depth Ologn and polynomial size

The class ACC can also be defined in terms of computations of nonuniform deterministic finite automata NUDFA over monoids In this framework the input is interpreted as elements from a fixed monoid and the input is accepted if the product of the input elements belongs to a given list of monoid elements The class ACC is the family of languages accepted by a NUDFA over some monoid that does not contain an unsolvable group as a subsemigroup

The class ACC includes AC This inclusion is strict because a single MOD2 gate computes the parity function which is known to be impossible to compute in AC More generally the function MOD can not be computed in ACp for prime p unless m is a power of p

The class ACC is included in TC It is conjectured that ACC is unable to compute the majority function of its inputs ie the inclusion in TC is strict but this remains unresolved as of July 2018

Every problem in ACC can be solved by circuits of depth 2 with AND gates of polylogarithmic fanin at the inputs connected to a single gate computing a symmetric function These circuits are called SYMcircuits The proof follows ideas of the proof of Todas theorem

It is known that computing the permanent is impossible for logtimeuniform ACC circuits which implies that the complexity class PP is not contained in logtimeuniform ACC

Lowood Queensland
Lowood is a town and locality in the Somerset Region in southeast Queensland Australia The town is on the Brisbane River west of the state capital Brisbane and north of Ipswich In the 2011 census Lowood had a population of 3336 people

Lowood was established as the first terminus of the Brisbane Valley branch railway in 1884 and the town grew from the subdivision around the new station The name is derived from the low woods of brigalow in the Lowood area as opposed to the taller trees elsewhere in the Brisbane Valley Lowood Post Office opened on 15 October 1888 a receiving office had been open from 1884

The Lowood public library opened in 2000
At the 2006 census Lowood had a population of 1010

Due to its proximity to Brisbane and Ipswich Lowood is becoming an area for hobby farmers and residential commuters Nearby Lake Wivenhoe is a popular place for activities such as boating and fishing

Lowood has a number of heritagelisted sites including

During World War II an airfield called Lowood which was actually located at Mount Tarampa was the site of a military airfield operated by the Royal Australian Air Force No 71 Squadron operated from the airfield during 1943 conducting coastal patrol and naval convoy escort missions After the war the airfield was converted into a motorracing circuit the Lowood Airfield Circuit and operated for 20 years the highlight hosting the 1960 Australian Grand Prix The airfield no longer exists but a small memorial marks its previous location

Following the withdrawal of the railmotor service to Toogoolawah in 1989 a substitute bus service to Ipswich was introduced by Queensland Rail QR Two services are in the morning and return services are in the late afternoon Time tables are available from QR

The Somerset Regional Council operates a public library at the corner of Michel and Main Streets

The Lowood branch of the Queensland Country Womens Association meets at 106 Main Street

Gulzar Alam worked in Pakistan Air force for sometime He left singing due to bad law and order situation in the region 

In January 2003 Gulzar was arrested while performing at a private wedding he was accused of drinking alcohol and rowdy behaviour but was later released Gulzar said he was humiliated by this however a more serious event took place in April of that year when 27 police officers forced entry to his home and arrested this three sons and a brother He stopped singing after receiving anonymous letters warning of the consequences of singing in public and started selling property instead however he eventually fled to Karachi

However following the elections of February 2008 the secular nationalist Awami National Party replaced the Muttahida MajliseAmal and they not only opened Nashtar Hall for cultural activities but invited Gulzar Alam back to singing Gulzar Alam accepted the invitation wholeheartedly and started his singing career again In April 2008 Peshawars Nishtar Hall was the citys only auditorium for promoting cultural activities had reopened after five years of closure due to the policies of the previous government  Gulzar was one the artists who performed at the reopening

Ashes to Ashes Only Fools and Horses
Ashes to Ashes is an episode of the BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses It was the second episode of Series 2 and was first screened on 28 October 1982 The episode title was based on the Christian funeral service phrase ashes to ashes dust to dust

As Del Boy and Rodney are in the market conducting business as usual Trigger arrives and asks them if they will attend the funeral of his grandmother Alice At first reluctant they learn that they will be the only other mourners so the Trotters agree

Later after the funeral Del Rodney Trigger and Grandad hang out at Alices house and Trigger tells the Trotters that his father died a couple of years before he was born as well as the story of how Alice had an affair with someone else while her husband Arthur was away fighting in the war Among the many things in the house are two urns that Del can sell

That night back at the flat as Del comes to the conclusion that the urns are valuable Grandad looks in one of the urns and is shocked to see the ashes of Triggers grandfather Arthur Then Grandad comes clean as he tells his grandsons that he was the other man who Alice had the affair with while Arthur was away because his wife had left him at the time When Arthur found out he told Grandad that he would come back and haunt him someday Del and Rodney do not believe that Arthurs ghost could have found Grandad and go to bed

Later that night at 300am Del comes out of the bathroom just to eavesdrop in on Grandad talking to the urn with Arthurs ashes in it Del decides to wind him up by talking through a traffic cone making Grandad think that Arthurs ghost is really talking to him But unfortunately Rodney is awakened by the noise and scares Del from behind Grandad finally has enough and demands that Del and Rodney get the ashes out of the flat But Del and Rodney cant get hold of Trigger since hes on holiday in Ireland Grandad suggests scattering Arthurs ashes at his old hangout the Peckham Bowling Green tomorrow night

The next night at the bowling club Del and Rodney decide to scatter the ashes evenly while saying a prayer but unfortunately they do not get to do so as the clubhouse lights up and the players arrive The Trotter brothers quickly escape into the night

The next morning Del and Rodney try to pour Arthurs ashes into the water at St Katharine Docks but are stopped by a river policeman played by John D Collins from doing so

After failing to pour the ashes into a cement mixer the Trotters get lucky when a council cleaning lorry sucks up the ashes from the urn Del is convinced that it makes sense since Arthur used to be a roadsweeper but Rodney is not sure

When they get back home Grandad tells Del and Rodney that Trigger received their telephone calls since hes fogbound at the airport Trigger tells Del something that Grandad forgot to mention Triggers grandmother Alice had been married twice Del then shows Grandad the other urn which of course is full of ashes

Although his reputation was founded on his career as a live interdisciplinary artist Stitt originally trained as a painter In recent years he has refocused on the materials processes and performance of painting His recent painting work conveys a tangible sense of physical and spatial tension capturing the surface world and the abstract or cognitive one behind it 
In 2008 he was awarded the Creative Wales Award from Arts Council of Wales to develop his painting practice and has since radically changed his output to painting

Potjaman Na Pombejra
Khun Ying Potjaman Na Pombejra   formerly Potjaman Shinawatra   ne Soypetpotjaman Damapong   born November 22 1956 is the exwife of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra

Potjaman was the youngest child and only daughter of Potjanee Na Pombejra and her husband Samoe Damapong a police general who excelled in his work on crime suppression and investigation and became a Deputy CommissionerGeneral of the Royal Thai Police Samoe Damapong came from a family of Lao origin his paternal grandfather was an Isan Lao from Nong Khai while his maternal grandmother was a princess of the Na Champassak family Potjaman and Thaksin married in July 1976 and they went on to have one son Panthongtae a businessman and two daughters Pinthongta and Paetongtarn In the late 1970s and 1980s Potjaman worked with Thaksin to develop his various commercial ventures

On January 23 2006 the Shinawatra family sold their entire stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings The Shinawatra and Damapong families netted about 73 billion baht taxfree from the sale using a regulation that made individuals who sell shares on the stock exchange exempt from capital gains tax

The Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission investigated the transaction and cleared the entire family from wrongdoing except for Potjamans son Panthongtae The SEC did find that Panthongtae committed minor infractions with regard to information disclosure and public tender offers in transactions between 2000 and 2002 
He was fined 6 million THB about 150000USD Allegations of insider trading by Potjaman other Shinawatra family members Shin Corporation Corp executives and major shareholders were also investigated No irregularities were found On 21 September 2006 the Revenue Department sent a letter to the Shinawatras advising the Shinawatra family not to pay taxes on the transaction Also in 2006 Revenue Department DirectorGeneral Sirot Sawadpanish testified to the military juntas Assets Examination Committee that the transaction was not taxable The junta investigated Sirot and 6 other senior Ministry of Finance officials for their role in dispensing legal advice regarding the transaction The AEC demanded that Potjaman testify to the Committee and threatened to jail her if she did not

After Thaksin was deposed by a military coup the juntaappointed Assets Examination Committee accused her of irregularities in the purchase of governmentowned land However the Bank of Thailand which supervised the sale of the land claimed that the sale was conducted properly

In January 2007 the Financial Institutions Development Fund complied with the Assets Examination Committee request to file a charge against Thaksin and his wife over their purchase of four 772 million baht plots of land from the FIDF in 2003 The charge was based on alleged violation of Section 100 of the National Counter Corruption Act which specifies that government officials and their spouses are prohibited from entering into or having interests in contracts made with state agencies under their authorisation However Section 4 of the Act indicates that persons committing malfeasance must be direct supervisors of the damaged party  in this case the FIDF At the time Bank of Thailand Governor Pridiyathorn Devakula directly supervised the FIDF not Thaksin Section 29 of the Bank of Thailand Act of 1942 stated that the Prime Minister did not have jurisdiction to oversee the FIDF because those managing the fund had sole authority for policies control oversight and regulations governing the agency Pridiyathorns testimony to the court occurred in secret  Thaksins legal team was not allowed in the room The FIDF later noted that the land was sold to the Shinawatras at a price greater than its appraised value The case went to the Supreme Court 10 July 2007

On 21 October 2008 the Supreme Court of Thailands Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions delivered a verdict on the Ratchadaphisek Land purchasing case ruling that

As Thaksin and wife defended themselves that the FIDF was not an administrative agency or state enterprise and Thaksin as the Prime Minister had no powers and duties to supervise scrutinise or monitor the Fund resulting that the land purchasing case was not a conflict of interest

The Court By unanimous resolution holding that the Fund was the administrative agency under Section 100 Subsection 1 of the National Counter Corruption Organic Act BE 2542 1997 By 63 holding that Thaksin was a de facto supervisor of the Fund By 72 holding that Potjaman was not a holder of political position or public authority prohibited under Section 122 of the Organic Act And by unanimous resolution holding that the purchased land and all other properties gained in this case could not be seized under Section 33 Subsection 1 and Subsection 2 of the Criminal Code

Therefore Thaksin was found guilty of abusing his power to help his wife purchasing the land at a knockdown price being sentenced to two years in imprisonment All accusations against Potjaman in the case shall lapse together with the arrest warrant whereof However as Thaksin was dwelling aboard the arrest warrant was issued to bring him back to the domestic punishment

Soon after the verdict was handed down Thaksin gave a telephone interview to Reuters stating he had expected the imprisonment term He was quoted as remarking that I have been informed of the result I had long anticipated that it would turn out this way and adding that the case was politically motivated

Thaksin Shinawatras wife Pojaman Shinawatra 51 who was found guilty on July 31 2008 and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment was released on 5 million baht bail Bangkok Criminal Court Judge Pramote Pipatpramote also convicted her adopted brother Bhanapot Damapong and her secretary The three defendants have high economic and social status But they were working together to avoid taxes even though the taxes amounted to little compared to their assets

On August 10 2008 Thaksin and his wife Khunying Potjaman flew to London from Beijing where he had been attending the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony In doing so he violated the terms of his bail Thaksin said that it was his wish to return to Thailand someday but claimed it was not currently safe enough for him and his family Thaksin announced his intention to seek political asylum in Britain His 3 children had reportedly flown ahead to Britain Meanwhile Thailands Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant for both Thaksin and his wife for jumping bail

Thai Supreme Commander Gen Boonsrang Niempradit and opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva accused Thaksin of hurting Thailand and damaging its reputation His Majesty the King recognizes highly the importance of the judiciary  The public should follow him

On September 17 Chief Justice Thonglor Chomngarm and the judges unanimously postponed the reading of the verdict to October 21 at 2 pm and issued the fresh arrest warrant for Thaksin and his wife Pojaman

On November 10 2008 the Department of Foreign Affairs Philippines Undersecretary Franklin Ebdalin stated the government would politely turn down any request for political refuge from the fugitive Thai leader xxx due to Manilas friendly relations with Bangkok If an applicant for political asylum insists the first thing the friendly country customarily does is to send him back to his home country The Department of Foreign Affairs had not received feelers that Thaksin wanted haven in the Philippines Of course he wouldnt want to be embarrassed thats why I dont think he would make such a request Hes no ordinary figure Hes a former prime minister of Thailand Amid Thai newspapers reports that Thaksin may land in Manila his brotherinlaw Somchai Wongsawat was set to arrive for a scheduled state visit on November 10 with Gloria MacapagalArroyo bilateral meeting on regional global financial crisis

The British Government Home Office revoked Potjaman Shinawatra and Thaksins visas while the Bangkok British Embassy emailed airlines advisory directing them to disallow Thaksin or his wife from boarding flights to the United Kingdom But Thaksins spokesman Phongthep Thepkanjana said I spoke with Thaksins secretary and he said that Thaksin still had not been notified by the British government Thaksin was reported to be travelling in East Asia having been forced to look for a home Thaksin still remains honorary president of the Manchester City Football Club which he sold in August Thaksin had considered sanctuaries such as China the Philippines and the Bahamas The Times reported the Thaksins were granted Bahamas honorary citizenship and the couple are building a 55 million home in China The visa revocation rendered moot the UK extradition issue but Thai prosecutors complained it would now be harder to keep track of him and he could end up in a country with which Thailand does not have an extradition treaty Somchai Wongsawat said The revoking of the visas is the decision by the Government of Great Britain We cannot criticise

Meanwhile Thaksins attorney Udom Prongfa filed a countercharge against Veera Somkwamkid with the Crime Suppression Division CSD Mr Veera went ahead and filed the charge even after the Royal Thai Police Office had concluded Mr Thaksin had done nothing wrong Also thousands of Thaksin supporters at the stadium gathered and claimed that only royal kindness or the power of the people could bring him home

Sirisak Tiypan director general for international affairs of the Office of the Attorney General said No matter China or the Philippines we have an extradition treaty with both countries Thaksin may appeal the guilty verdict until November 22 but prosecutors are working on extradition documents Sirisak added that even if Thaksin decides to live in a country with which Thailand has no extradition treaty authorities could ask for him to be handed over on a reciprocal basis Bahamas Bermuda and African countries without extradition treaties with Thailand have reportedly offered to take in Thaksin and his wife

There has been a controversy on whether there is any hidden interest when Thaksin and Potjamn transferred their Shin Corp shares to their children Panthongtae and Pinthongtharn Shinawatra were accused of being nominees of their parents 
Potjamn transferred her shares to Parnthongtae was said to have been a setup For Panthongtaes case the shares have been sold to him at cost price Prior the transfer Panthongtae had written an agreement to settle a 45billion baht debt for buying 300 million shares of Thai Military BankTMB to Potjaman In which the real value of TMB share at that time was 15billion baht This means that there has been a fake debt worth of 3billion baht

The Assets Examination Committee AEC later revealed that Panthongtaes account that receives Shin Corp dividend has been transferring money to Potjamns account exceeds the debt to 11Billion baht

Pintongtha was accused of being another nominee of her parents In response to the accusation she said that her mother gave her a certain amount of money to buy Shin Corp shares from her brother Panthongtae Potjamn gave money to her daughter to buy 367 million shares of Shin Corp which leaves Panthongtae an equal number of shares Pintongthas account has been receiving dividend from Shin Corp and there has not been any transaction between Pintongthas account and Potjamns account However the money was used to buy SC Asset shares from WinMark worth of 71 million baht and buy shares from another five realestate firms from two funds in 2004 worth of 485 million baht

DSI AEC and Securities and Exchange Commission later revealed common information that WinMark and the two funds are owned by Thaksin and Potjamn Shinawatra Potjaman responded the accusation that she did not own Winmark neither her husband The company is however owned by a realestate firm from the middle east

Bannapot Damapong Potjaman Shinawatras brotherin law was charged with wealth concealing of Shin Cop Shares Bannapot cofounder of Shin Corp was believed to own 162 of the companys shares right from the beginning when the company turned public Howeverm 1075 was accused of being a nominee to Potjaman Shinawatra The 1075 is the separated into two sections The first section worth of 162 Bannapot used Potjamans money to buy the shares to increase his holdings The 913 leftover was accused as being a fraud The transaction made it look like that Bannapot was buying shares from Potjaman But the promissory note for buying the shares was accused of being made up after the incident as the name of Potjaman was stated as Lady Potjaman where at the time of the transaction her status was not yet a lady

Khunying Potjaman has received the following royal decorations in the Honours System of Thailand

On 1 November 2006 the ship sank on the east coast of Sweden At the time of the sinking Finnbirch had a crew of 14 of four Swedes and ten Filipinos The ship capsized in a heavy storm which also set an oil rig adrift The crew were seen sitting on the ships hull but the storm prevented rescue boats from reaching the scene and it was too dangerous to lower the helicopter crew onto the violently pitching hull All but two of the men were eventually rescued after jumping into the sea once the ship had capsized One of the Filipino crew members died in the hospital after his rescue suit failed and a Swede drowned after being entangled in the wreck The master of the ship broke several bones after falling but survived On 7 November 2006 the Merchant Marine Officers Association criticized the rescue stating that the helicopter had been circling overhead whilst the crew members sat on the hull waiting to be rescued

Adi Ophir born 22 September 1951 is an Israeli philosopher

Professor Ophir teaches philosophy at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University He is also a fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute where he directs an interdisciplinary research project on Humanitarian Action in Catastrophes The Shaping of Contemporary Political Imagination and Moral Sensibilities 

Ophirs recent book The Order of Evils offers a moral theory that emphasizes the socially structured existential and political nature of evil He argues that evils like pain suffering loss and humiliation are superfluous evils that can often be prevented but are not 

Analyzing seminal works by modern and postmodern philosophers such as Rousseau Kant Marx Sartre Arendt Foucault and Derrida Ophir submits that to be moral is to care for others and to be committed to preventing their suffering and distress

Ophirs focus on understanding particular evils rather than some transcendentalized Evil keeps his thought determinedly secular While a deeply theoretical work The Order of Evils is informed by Ophirs preoccupation with two major events in recent Jewish history the Holocaust and the Israeli occupation of Palestine He does not compare these two events but instead introduces a typology of disasters that locates them within the wide spectrum of calamities generated by humans to exhibit both the specificities and general patterns that subsequently emerge

List of Governors of Menorca
Below is a list of known governors of Menorca from the time of the British occupation in 1708 until the British relinquished control of the island for the last time in 1802

It was commonplace for governors to be absent from the island and several never set foot there Menorca changed hands several times in the 18th century It was ruled by Britain from its initial capture in 1708 until 1756 then occupied by France for seven years until the Peace of Paris 1763 when it was returned to Britain In 1781 the island fell to a Spanish invasion and in 1783 Britain ceded the island to Spain It was captured by the British for a final time in 1798 and occupied until it was returned in 1802 to Spain

Roseland Park
Roseland Park is a now defunct amusement park previously located at 169 Lake Shore Drive in the city of Canandaigua New York along the north shore of Canandaigua Lake Roseland started operation in 1925 under its founder and original owner William Muar It continued to operate for 60 years until its closure on Labor Day September 2 1985

Roseland originally opened up under the name Lakeside Park with little more than a dance hall and a few rides The dance hall itself was named Roseland after the Roseland Ballroom in New York City After three years it had become such an integral component to the parks identity that the park itself was renamed from Lakeside to Roseland Over the years as the park changed and grew it saw many rides come and go Some of the additional attractions saw things like a Ferris wheel bumper cars a miniature train ride a sky ride that went out over part of Canandaigua Lake before returning to the station and the parks Carousel which was purchased for the park in 1941 from the defunct Long Branch amusement park For a period of time there was even a live circus act Additional attractions have been added and changed over the years including the addition of the parks major wooden roller coaster the Skyliner which was built in 1960

The following is a partial list of attractions Roseland had at various points throughout its history
On September 16 two weeks following the park closure an auction was held to sell off all of the parks remains While almost nothing of the site that Roseland once occupied remains today two of the parks most notable rides can still be found in operation Philadelphia Toboggan Companys carousel No 18 was purchased at the auction for 397500 by the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse It was refurbished and restored to its original colors and then installed at the Carousel Center mall in Syracuse New York on October 15 1990 Carousel No 18 was originally built in 1909

The other ride still in operation is the Skyliner a wooden roller coaster This ride was also built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company It was built at Roseland and opened in 1960 where it operated until the park closure in 1985 It was then moved to Lakemont Park in Altoona Pennsylvania reopening in 1987 under the same name It was designed by John C Allen who later went on to design the Blue Streak at Cedar Point It is a double out and back coaster with a track length of 2400 feet and a maximum height of 60 feet

A housing development now sits on the property where Roseland Park once was Though the park has long since shut down its name still exists today in the form of Roseland Waterpark which is also located in Canandaigua

Proechimys
Proechimys is a genus of South American spiny rats of the family Echimyidae All species of the genus are terrestrial In the lowland Neotropical forests Proechimys rodents are often the most abundant nonvolant mammals They are recognizable by reason of their elongated heads and long rostra large and erect ears narrow and long hind feet and tails always shorter than headandbody lengths The dorsal pelage comprises a mixture of expanded varyingly stiffened spines or aristiforms  hence the vernacular name of spiny rats  and soft hairs or setiforms

Proechimys is the most speciose genus of the rodent family Echimyidae with 25 species recognized followed by Phyllomys with 13 species and Trinomys with 11 species

The genus Proechimys is the sister group to the genus Hoplomys the armored rat In turn these two taxa share evolutionary affinities with other Myocastorini genera Callistomys the painted treerat and Myocastor the coypu or nutria on the one hand and Thrichomys on the other hand

Reconstructing the systematics and phylogeny of Proechimys species have been greatly hampered by extreme levels of within and amongpopulation character variability This difficulty has been emphasized by Pine et al
To infer the phylogeny of Proechimys at the species level morphological characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences have been used and allowed to group species into major clades but whose interrelationships remain unresolved Six species groups were identified group semispinosus group longicaudatus group guyannensis group trinitatus group goeldii and group gardneri and 4 species Proechimys simonsi P echinothrix P canicollis and P decumanus remained unaffiliated to any of these groups
br
The different groups of species can be diagnosed as follows

Proechimys species presently occur mainly in South America in all countries except Argentina Uruguay and Chile One member of the genus P semispinosus also ranges into Central America

The team was named after English professional football club Sheffield United On 11 December 2005 Sheffield United took over the organization and changed the clubs badge as well as the teams home kit to represent this The club went on to achieve promotion and their highest ever league position of seventh in the top tier of Chinese football until they were embroiled in a matchfixing scandal in 2009 Punished with relegation the owners eventually sold their majority on 9 December 2010 to Hung Fu Enterprise Co Ltd and Scarborough Development China Co Ltd On 23 May 2013 the Tiancheng Investment Group announced the acquisition of the club

The club was formed on 26 February 1996 under the name Chengdu Wuniu and entered into Chinas Yi League with Wang Fengzhu as their first manager In their inaugural year the team topped both their second round group as well as their final round group and progressed to the semifinals before losing to Shenzhen Jinpeng 21 on aggregate Their second season in 1997 season saw them rise into Chinas Jia B League this time coming second in the 2nd round group but again topping the final round group They went on to win both their legs of the quarter finals 10 against Beijing Kuanli and after brushing aside Shaanxi Guoli 20 they progressed through to the final but lost 10 however they were still promoted along with the winners Jiangsu Jiajia as well as both semifinal losers

After gaining promotion to the second tier Chengdu Wuniu started the 1998 campaign well losing only two of their first nine matches in the higher division however in round 10 they were well beaten 80 away to Liaoning Tianlun Their best win came in their penultimate match of the season when they beat Jiangsu Jiajia 41 and the team ended the season midtable in eighth out of 12 Chengdus second year in Jia B once again started well with the team losing just 1 of their first 13th games before succumbing to Beijing Kuanli away 40 At the end of the season after 22 matches Chengdu Wuniu finished 6th with 9 wins and 8 draws The start of the millennium season saw a name change for the team to Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng and proceeded with a poorer start than in previous years including defeat away to Guangzhou Apollo 50 however the team did manage to finish in 8th place

The team started well for the 2001 season going unbeaten in their first eight games and went on to finish in third position however the season was tarnished when match fixing allegations came to light involving Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng and four other teams The teams record win over Sichuan Mianyang Taiji 112 and their 42 away victory against Jiangsu Shuntian were put under the spotlight and as a consequence all coaches and players involved in both matches along with another game featuring the other two teams were banned for one year and all five teams had three months to reform and reapply for playing in the next seasons CFA competitions The only points were deducted from Sichuan Mianyang Taiji but they were relegated as punishment To make the season even more disappointing Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng fell at the first round of the Mexin Doors FA Cup losing 21 away to Jia A League side Tianjin Teda CEC

In 2002 Chengdu Wuniu Guoteng were reformed as a result of the previous seasons match fixing and were renamed Chengdu Taihe Early in the season the team final progressed passed the first round of the Fuji Films FA Cup beating Shenyang Ginde 32 in nearby Deyang with a last minute goal however they were soon on their way home again after losing 31 to Qingdao Yizhong Hainiu once again in Deyang The league competition followed in much the same vein with the team finishing in 9th of 12 however a midseason venue change to City Stadium in Luzhou cant have helped however Santos did manage to achieve joint top divisional scorer with 10 goals for the club

The team crashed out yet again in the earliest stage of the Landi FA Cup in 2003 losing 2 of their 3 group matches The team started using City Stadium in Deyang as its home ground this season and its name reverted to the name Chengdu Wuniu in round 6 of the league in July They finished the year in a respectable 6th place out of 14 after the division had been enlarged and beat 4th placed Jiangsu Shuntian 51 in October

Chengdu Wunius poor cup performance continued in 2004 losing 53 on penalties after extra time to Qingdao Beilaite in the first round of the Landi FA Cup The poor performance also contributed to their final position of 13th out of 17 that year after another enlargement This season was also played at two differing home venues the Provincial Sports Centre in Chengdu as well as City Stadium in Deyang

The 2005 season was finally played back at one home venue in Chengdu the Chengdu Sports Centre They again crashed out of the CFA Cup in the first round this time to Chinese Super League side Shanghai International Their poor performance in the league also continued finishing 11th of 14 in the league

Chengdu Wuniu underwent another name change in January 2006 when they were bought out by the then Chairman of English football team Sheffield Uniteds Kevin McCabe who renamed the club Chengdu Blades to reflect the new owners nickname The Blades as well as changing the kits and badge while the reserve team were sent to Hong Kong and named Sheffield United Hong Kong to advertise its association with the owning company Sheffield Uniteds unique international football model would continue with the purchase of Hungarian club Ferencvrosi TC and significant stakes with Australian team Central Coast Mariners FC which were overseen by Group Executive Director Michael Farnan who was responsible for the commercial development of the Sheffield United International Group While this was going on the teams performance improved and by the end of the year they had climbed to 4th position in the table their 2nd best ever finish at that time

At the start of the 2007 Chinese league campaign Chengdus opening game of the season against Harbin Yiteng finished in a 60 victory in front of a home crowd of 4000 spectators which resulted in the opposing Head Coach Wang Hongli creating a Chinese League record for the fastest resignation after just one game The clubs strong start to the season continued and they wouldnt even concede their first goal until 26 May 2007 in their Round 9 league game against Tibet Huitong which they still went on to win 21 Even during the league break Chengdu went on to face Chinese Super League side Shanghai Shenhua in a friendly that Chengdu came back to win 21 Round 14 commenced with a 31 win against Harbin Yiteng and the Blades moved onto the top spot However following consecutive 11 draws with Nanchang Bayi and Chongqing Lifan the Blades fell back into 2nd position This was cemented by their first defeat of the season losing 21 against leaders Guangzhou Guangyao

The Blades returned to winning ways with 4 straight wins against Beijing Hongdeng 20 Nanjing Yoyo 61 Qingdao Hailifeng 20 and Tibet Huitong 30 and after 20 games the Blades were still in the second automatic promotion place with just another 4 matches to play 5 points behind Guangzhou Pharmaceutical

The Blades snatched victory 21 in the last minute against Yanbian in their next away game to put themselves within touching distance of promotion requiring just one more win which followed a week later in round 23 with Chengdu securing their place in next seasons beating Shanghai Stars 42 in front of their home crowd

Chengdu drew their penultimate game of the season 11 against BIT Beijing and faced former promotion rivals 3rd placed Jiangsu Shuntian in the final fixture of the China League at home on 27 October which finished 00 to ensure a promotion party just two seasons after the buyout by Sheffield United

Chengdu had the privilege of staging the opening ceremony of the 2008 season of the Chinese Super League before their first match at home to Liaoning FC which was broadcast live on Chinese TV The newcomers fell behind after an hours play but managed to earn a point just a few minutes later after Liu Cheng equalised After an away defeat to 2007 champions Changchun Yatai on 5 April the Blades had two successive victories against Zhejiang Lcheng and Dalian Shide to move into 3rd place And on 27 April 2008 Chengdu Blades beat Shanghai Shenhua with a score 21 and moved into the second place This was followed by a 31 away loss to Tianjin Teda and then a 11 draws against Qingdao Jonoon

On 12 May Chengdu was rocked by the 2008 Sichuan earthquake none of the Chengdu Blades personnel were injured and in the following days both staff and players donated blood for the cause The players also visited schools affected by the earthquake and the club donated more than 11000 along with tents umbrellas water food and clothes including more than 5000 football shirts to people affected in the region At the following game against Changsha Ginde on 17 May China Leagues first ever minutes silence was held before the match which ended in a 11 draw all gate money from this rounds games around China would also be given to the disaster zones

In the remaining rounds Chengdu only won one more game beating Shenzhen 30 at home drew another 9 matches 4 of which were 00 draws and lost the other 10 games This was enough to finish 13th in table and avoid relegation

On 23 February 2010 Chengdu was relegated to China League One in the fallout of a match fixing scandal despite having achieved a 7thplace finish in the Chinese Super League the previous season It was discovered by the Chinese police that on 22 September 2007 during the teams promotion campaign that the clubs President Xu Hongtao and his deputy You Kewei paid Qingdao Hailifeng FC up to 500000 RMB to lose a league game 20 Despite this setback under Wang Baoshan as manager Chengdu Blades won immediate promotion back to the Chinese Super League after finishing second in league one one point behind winners Guangzhou With the clubs owners Sheffield United struggling within their own league funding for Chengdu Blades was cut and they experienced financial problems during the season which resulted in the club finishing 15th and in the relegation zone at the end of the season

Olley v Marlborough Court Ltd
Olley v Marlborough Court Hotel 1949 1 KB 532 is an English contract law case on exclusion clauses in contract law The case stood for the proposition that a representation made by one party cannot become a term of a contract if made after the agreement was made The representation can only be binding where it was made at the time the contract was formed

Mrs Olley was a long staying resident of the Marlborough Court Hotel Lancaster Gate London As usual she left her room key on a rack behind the reception one day but when she came back it was gone Inside her room her fur coat had been stolen A witness called Colonel Crerer who was sitting in the lounge saw a person go in and come out again with a parcel fifteen minutes later The porter had apparently been cleaning a bust of the Duke of Marlborough and failed to notice Mrs Olley asked to be repaid for the cost of the coat The Hotel pointed to an exclusion clause on a notice behind a door in the bedroom leading to a washbasin which said
The proprietors will not hold themselves responsible for articles lost or stolen unless handed to the manageress for safe custody
Mrs Olley argued that the clause was not incorporated into the contract

Denning LJ Singleton LJ and Bucknill LJ found firstly that the Hotel had failed to take reasonable care as they were required to do contractually and under Innkeepers Liability Act 1863 s 1
Secondly the disclaimer was not part of the contract and the hotel could not rely upon it The contract for the storage of the coat was formed at the reception desk There was no way that Mrs Olley could have been aware of the disclaimer at that point and so it could not be part of the contract

<doc id="7730205" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730205" title="Aenesidemus book">
Aenesidemus book
Aenesidemus is a German book published anonymously by Professor Gottlob Ernst Schulze of Helmstedt in 1792 Schulze attempted to refute the principles that Karl Leonhard Reinhold established in support of Immanuel Kants Critique of Pure Reason 1781 The title is a reference to Aenesidemus an ancient Greek skeptical philosopher Its complete title in English translation was Aenesidemus or Concerning the Foundations of the Philosophy of the Elements Issued by Professor Reinhold in Jena Together with a Defense of Skepticism against the Pretensions of the Critique of Reason  

The book was supposed to be a written correspondence between Hermias Greek a follower of Hermes who believes in the Kantian critical philosophy and Aenesidemus Greek he who praises the people who is skeptical about that philosophy The skepticism of David Humes skepticism about induction according to this book was not disproved by Kant As Hume had asserted the existence of causality the soul or the thinginitself cannot be proved

Philosophy cannot establish the existence or nonexistence of the thinginitself By establishing general principles we cant know the limits of our ability to know Progressive development however can approach complete knowledge

No skeptic can doubt the reality and certainty of mental representations and mental events that are immediately given through consciousness

Skepticism does not claim that metaphysical questions cannot be answered

Skepticism doubts the possibility of knowledge about the existence or nonexistence of the thinginitself Kant however was guilty of begging the question in that he presupposed that the thinginitself exists and causally interacts with observing subjects

Kant and Reinhold claimed that the reality of objects can be known from the representations in the mind of the observing subject This is inferring objective reality from subjective thought Such an inference is the fallacy of drawing existential conclusions from logical premises

Kants critical philosophy is selfcontradictory He said that thingsinthemselves cause sensations in an observers mind Kant applied causality to noumena But in his critique he had claimed that causality is a category of the understanding that can only be applied to phenomena

Kant posited real existence to the postulates of God Free Will and Immortal Souls But this is more than is necessary for moral theology which only requires belief in them as Ideas of Reason

The science of psychology does not require that the soul have faculties Rather psychology is a detailed description and systematic classification of actual mental events

If we were to take critical philosophy seriously we would commit ourselves to resolving experiences into two parts  a system of universal subjective forms on one side and a mass of amorphous meaningless objective matter on the other

How can we be sure that Kants obligation to be moral is the result of freedom It might be the result of some irrational natural force

Kants response was indicated in his letter to Jakob Sigismund Beck December 4 1792 

Reinhold wrote that true skepticism rested on the fact that only the observing subject felt what was in its consciousness The only truth is the subjects notion that there is an object that agrees with its internal mental representation 

Johann Fichte agreed with Reinholds subjectivity He based his own idealism on the observing subjects internal forms of knowledge Arthur Schopenhauer agreed with Schulze Therefore the world as REPRESENTATION in which aspect alone we are here considering it has two essential necessary and inseparable halves The one half is the object whose forms are space and time and through these plurality But the other half the subject does not lie in space and time for it is whole and undivided in every representing being Hence a single one of these beings with the object completes the world as representation just as fully as do the millions that exist And if that single one were to disappear then the world as representation would no longer exist Therefore these halves are inseparable even in thought for each of the two has meaning and existence only through and for the other each exists with the other and vanishes with it

bniste
bniste  is the French word for a cabinetmaker

As opposed to bniste menuisier denotes a woodcarver or chairmaker in French The English equivalent for bniste ebonist is not commonly used Originally an bniste was one who worked with ebony a favoured luxury wood for midseventeenth century Parisian cabinets originating in imitation of elite furniture being made in Antwerp The word is 17th century in origin Early Parisian bnistes often came from the Low Countries themselves an outstanding example is Pierre Golle who worked at the Gobelins manufactory making cabinets and table tops veneered with marquetry the traditional enrichment of bnisterie or cabinetwork

bnistes make case furniture which may be veneered or painted Under Parisian guild regulations the application of painted varnishes generically called vernis Martin was carried out in separate workshops sawdust being an enemy to freshly varnished surfaces At the outset of the French Revolution the guilds in Paris and elsewhere were abolished and with them went all their regulations One result of this is that Paris chairmakers were now able to produce veneered chairs as London furnituremakers less stringently ruled had been able to make since the first chairs with splats had been produced shortly before 1720 in imitation of Chinese chairs

Because of this amalgamation chairs and other seat furniture began to use veneering techniques which were formerly the guarded privilege of bnistes This privilege became less distinct after the relaxation of guild rules of the Ancien Rgime and after the French Revolutions abolition of guilds in 1791 Seat furniture in the Empire style was often veneered with mahogany and later in pale woods also

From the midnineteenth century onward the two French trades bniste and menuisier were often assembled under the single roof of a furnisher and the craft began to make way for the industry 

From the mid17th century through the 18th a notable number of bnistes of German and Low Countries extraction were preeminent among Parisian furnituremakers as the abbreviated list below suggests

Borsh
Borsh Borsnow Shirain is a maritime village in the Albanian Riviera in the former Lukov municipality Vlor County Albania At the 2015 local government reform it became part of the municipality Himar The village is inhabited by Muslim Albanians who speak the Lab dialect of Albanian

Borsh borders with Fterra Qeparo Piqeras and has a population of 2500 inhabitants

The region which Borshi is located was part of the Chaonia of the ancient region of Epirus The castle remained in use in Roman times and was refortified by the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century Nothing is known of the settlement in the Byzantine era until it is mentioned as Sopotos in 1258 when it was part of the Despotate of Epirus tha grew out of the failing Byzantine empire Borsh then went through a period of considerable turmoil changing hands several times between the Despotate of Epirus and Norman crusades invaders before being taken by the Turks in 1431

Fifty years later it was captured by Albanians led by Skenderbeg but was retaken by the Turks only eleven years later and heavily refortified On June 10 1570 the castle of Sopot was taken by James Celsi Proveditor of the Venetian navy who left after leaving in charge the Greek commander of Nauplion Emmanuel Mormoris This also triggered part of the nearby Himariotes to submit to Venetian rule The next year the Ottoman army recaptured it and took Mormori as a prisoner

The 18th century was a turbulent economic time and due to Orthodox revolts and conflicts with Orthodox powers such as the Russian Empire Ottoman governors at times applied pressures including drastic tax raises on the local Christian population as well as other pressures caused towns to convert Borsh converted in 1744 and followed it up by raiding nearby Piqeras which remained Christian
The fortress was renovated again by Ali Pasha Tepelena and it is these fortifications that visitors can view by taking the halfhour walk up to the castle rock the limestone mount clearly visible above the old village During Ali pashas reign there were 700 houses at Borsh and below the castle mount you can see a ruined mosque of Hajji Bendo and madrese a Muslim theological school both of which were damaged in Ali Pashas wars but survived only to be destroyed by fighting after 1912 when the Turks left the region

Between 1912 and 1914 serious interethnic conflict took place between Greeks and Albanians and significant portion of the old village was destroyed however some fine buildings remain Modern Borsh was built after that but became seriously depopulated first due to malaria and following severe reprisal killings by Germans in WW2 however depopulation was balanced by an influx of refugees from Vlora fleeing into partisan territory from the city which was heavily contested until late in the war

The village is very stable and growing in prosperity thanks to tourism and olive oil production The thing that makes Borsh very popular is its beach which is the largest beach in Ionian sea 7km

The tourism has begun to develop a lot thanks to villages beauty and thanks to its friendly people Continuing in this way Borsh will become soon the best destination for tourists in the South of Albania

The Lab dialect spoken in Borsh was reported by Albanian linguist M Totoni to possess nasal vowels a characteristic that was previously thought to have been the diagnostic difference between the major Tosk and Gheg divisions whereby Tosk dialects such as Borshs lab dialect were previously thought to have all lost nasal vowels when they split from Gheg dialects which retained the nasality feature

St Leonards Church Cotheridge
St Leonards Church is a small 12thcentury church located in the scattered village of Cotheridge in Worcestershire It stands not far from the manor house Cotheridge Court The church boasts an ancient wooden tower The main part of the church the nave has a plastered ceiling with its beams remaining hidden though some ceiling beams in the chancel are visible The chancel floor is partially tiled 

The church belongs to the Diocese of Worcester with its denomination being Church of England and small services are still held It lies upon the pilgrimage route to Wales from Worcester and is today a visitors centre

The oldest parts of the church are the chancel and the nave which contains a carved stone Norman Arch dividing them These date to the early part of the 12th century during the reign of Henry I The walls of the chancel and the nave are probably sandstone but they are plastered on both sides The windows in the nave are also 12th century The ceiling of the nave is plastered and is curved with no beams showing

During the 15th century the wooden bell tower was added It is square ascends in four stages and is built of chestnut and oak The studded oak doorway to the tower also provides access to the church

Dating from the 17th century it is oakpanelled and is hexagonal in shape

In the chancel the floor is made of reddish tiles Four of them bear the arms of Gloucester Abbey three of them with the Elephant Head of Throckmorton two carry the Berkeley arms and one a Passion Shield inscribed in Latin

Since 1570 the ownership has followed the descent of the manor house Cotheridge Court and in 1623 John Acton sold the church to William Berkeley who had previously purchased the manor from Acton in 1615

In 1684 it received restoration from Rowland Berkeley and between 1615 and 1939 it has been cared for by the Berkeley family It is now a part of the Diocese of Worcester

In November 1947 the nave roof collapsed Though there were only about 200 people in the parish they decided to save their church After 13 years the restoration work was completed but it was considered unsafe to leave the four bells in the bell tower and to this day only one remains

Once again in April 1979 the nave roof was considered unsafe with the possibility of collapsing The people of Cotheridge and their neighbouring parishes raised money for the restoration With additional help from the Worcester Diocese English Heritage and the Historic Churches Preservation Trust the work was completed in 1987

The churchyard contains two war graves of Royal Artillery soldiers of World War II

Passing novel
Passing is a novel by American author Nella Larsen first published in 1929 Set primarily in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City in the 1920s the story centers on the reunion of two childhood friendsClare Kendry and Irene Redfieldand their increasing fascination with each others lives The title refers to the practice of racial passing and is a key element of the novel Clare Kendrys attempt to pass as white for her husband John Jack Bellew is its most significant depiction in the novel and a catalyst for the tragic events

Larsens exploration of race was informed by her own mixed racial heritage and the increasingly common practice of racial passing in the 1920s Praised upon publication the novel has since been celebrated in modern scholarship for its complex depiction of race gender and sexuality and is the subject of considerable scholarly criticism As one of only two novels that Larsen wrote Passing has been significant in placing its author at the forefront of several literary canons

As early as 1925 Nella Larsen had decided that she wanted to be among the New Negro writers receiving considerable attention at the time Initially writing short stories that were sold early in 1926 to a ladies magazine she was rumored that year to be writing a novel In a letter to her friend Carl Van Vechten she acknowledges it is the awful Truth But who knows if Ill get through with the damned thing Certainly not I In April 1927 Larsen and her husband Elmer Imes moved from Jersey City New Jersey to Harlem to be closer to the cultural phenomenon The following year Larsen published her first novel Quicksand with New Yorkbased publisher Knopf and its favorable critical reception encouraged her ambitions to become known as a novelist

The 1920s in the United States was a period marked by considerable anxiety and discussion over the crossing of racial boundaries the socalled color line between blacks and whites This anxiety was exacerbated by the Great Migration in which hundreds of thousands of blacks left the rural south for northern and midwestern cities where together with new waves of immigrants they changed the social makeup The practice of persons crossing the color lineattempting to claim recognition in another racial group than the one they were believed to belong towas known as passing As many African Americans had European ancestry in varying proportions some appeared visibly European The legacy of slavery with its creation of a racial caste and the imposition in the early 20th century of the socalled onedrop rule by which someone with even one ancestor of subSaharanAfrican origin was considered black led to a hardening of racial lines that had historically been more fluid at any time the concept of race was historically contingent Although the exact numbers of people who passed is for obvious reasons not known many estimates were made at the time The sociologist Charles S Johnson 18931956 calculated that 355000 blacks had passed between 1900 and 1920

A significant precedent for Larsens depiction of Clare and Jacks relationship was the 1925 legal trial known as the Rhinelander Case or Rhinelander v Rhinelander On the urging of his family Leonard Kip Rhinelander a wealthy white man sued his wife Alice Beatrice Jones for annulment and fraud he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her colored blood The case concerned not only race but also status and class as he had met her when she was working as a domestic Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice she contended that her mixed race was obvious and she had never denied it it came at a devastating social cost for both parties intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court and Alice was forced to partially disrobe in front of the jury in the judges chambers in order for them to assess the darkness of her skin 
Larsen refers to the case near the end of the novel when Irene wonders about the consequences of Jack discovering Clares racial status What if Bellew should divorce Clare Could he There was the Rhinelander case The case received substantial coverage in the press of the time and Larsen could assume that it was common knowledge to her readers

The story is written as a third person narrative from the perspective of Irene Redfield a mixedrace woman who lives in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City

Part One of the book titled Encounter opens with Irene receiving a letter from Clare Kendry causing her to recall a chance encounter she had had with her at the roof restaurant of the Drayton Hotel in Chicago during a brief stay in the city The women grew up together but lost touch when Clares white father died and she was taken to live with her two paternal white aunts Irene learns that Clare passes for white living primarily in Europe with her unsuspecting rich white husband and their daughter Although Irene tries to avoid further engagement with Clare she never is able to fully exclude her from her life as she later visits Clare for tea along with another childhood friend Gertrude Martin Toward the end of the visit Clares white husband John Jack Bellew arrives Unaware that all three women are black Jack expresses some very racist views and makes the women uneasy However the women play along in an effort to maintain Clares secret identity Afterward Irene and Gertrude decide that Clares situation is too dangerous for them to continue associating with her and are uncomfortable around Clare and her husband Irene receives a letter of apology from Clare but destroys it in her quest to try and forget about Clare and get her out of her life Instead Irene wants to focus on her life with her husband Brian and her two sons Theodore and Brian Jr

Part Two of the book Reencounter returns to the present with Irene having received the new letter from Clare After Irene ignores Clares letter Clare visits in person so Irene reluctantly agrees to see her When it is brought up that Irene serves on the committee for the Negro Welfare League NWL Clare invites herself to their upcoming dance despite Irenes advice against it for fear that Jack will find out Clare attends the dance and enjoys herself without her husband finding out which encourages her to continue spending time in Harlem Irene and Clare resume their childhood companionship and Clare frequently visits Irenes home

The third and final part of the novel begins before Christmas as Irenes relationship with her husband has become increasingly fraught Aware of her friends appeal Irene becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair with Clare During a shopping trip with her visibly black friend Felise Freeland Irene encounters Jack who becomes aware of her and by extension Clares racial status Irene considers warning Clare about Jacks newfound knowledge but decides against it worried that the pairs divorce might encourage her husband to leave her for Clare Later Clare accompanies Irene and Brian to a party hosted by Felise The gathering is interrupted by Jack who accuses Clare of being a damned dirty nigger Irene rushes to Clare who is standing by an open window Suddenly Clare falls out of the window from the top floor of the building to the ground below where she is pronounced dead by the guests who eventually gather at the site Whether she has fallen accidentally was pushed by either Irene or Bellew or committed suicide is unclear The book ends with Irenes fragmented anguish at Clares death

Passing has been described as the tragic story of a beautiful lightskinned mulatto passing for white in high society The tragic mulatto also mulatta when referring to a woman is a stock character in early AfricanAmerican literature Such accounts often featured the lightskinned offspring of a white slaveholder and his black slave whose mixed heritage in a racebased society means that she is unable to identify or find a place with either blacks or whites The resulting feeling of exclusion was portrayed as variably manifested in selfloathing depression alcoholism sexual perversion and attempts at suicide

On the surface Passing conforms to that stereotype in its portrayal of Clare Kendry whose passing for white has tragic consequences however the book resists the conventions of the genre as Clare refuses to feel the expected anguish at the betrayal of her black identity and socializes with blacks for the purposes of excitement rather than racial solidarity Scholars have more generally considered Passing as a novel in which the major concern is not race For instance Claudia Tate describes the issue as merely a mechanism for setting the story in motion sustaining the suspense and bringing about the external circumstances for the storys conclusion

Catherine Rottenberg argues that Larsens novella is a prime example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US The main characters Irene and Clare and their struggle with their own identification problems in the novel helps readers understand the difference between gender and race norms These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by reevaluating the idea of desireidentification The misidentification Clare deals with stems from her reconnection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her AfricanAmerican culture Irenes identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion Irene doesnt want to put herself into a dangerous situation

As scholars show race is not the only primary concern in Nella Larsens Passing Class is also a major aspect that is simultaneously developed Both of the main characters Irene Redfield and Clare Kendry present a strong sense of class They also demonstrate how they cross clearly defined class borders in order to obtain more power in their life

Clare Kendry crosses social class binaries Clare does not inhabit any particular social class but rather lives as both a workingclass and a middleclass woman in the novel Clare is born in a workingclass family where her father is a janitor of the building that she lives in In adulthood she passes during her marriage to obtain the lifestyle of an upper middleclass woman Despite having the luxury and comfort that she has always wanted but never had had in her childhood Clare still longs for her childhood experiences and constantly visits Irene and her maid Zulena Because Clare shares many experiences of the workingclass she feels very comfortable when talking to Zulena as if Zulena was her friend Clares desire to live in both social classes at the same time shows how these class boundaries are fluid

While Clare demonstrates her class binaries Irene is very protective towards her own status quo Irene grew up as a middleclass person and continues to live as such after marrying a doctor Irene is more hesitant to cross between middleclass and workingclass she isolates herself and avoids all of the circumstances that she might be mistaken for a lowerclass person For example during Irenes attempt to pass to become an elite white woman at Drayton hotel she makes a clear distinction between herself and workingclass individuals by showing her desire to be separated from the sweating masses Irene is also concerned that people at the Negro League Dance might mistake Clare for a prostitute Throughout the novel Irene seems comfortable living in a higher social class while Clare constantly crosses between the two classes

Scholar Sami Schalk argues that the notion of eugenic ideology emerges in the novel Eugenic Ideology assigns specific behavioral and physical traits to different distinctions of race class gender and sexual identity Both physical and behavioral features of this ideology are discussed by the main characters in Passing Irene and Clare For example several times in the novel Irene acknowledges the way white people racially designate physical traits to African Americans in order to identify them The concept of eugenic ideology also emerges when Clares aunts assign her to a domestic servant role believing this would align with her skin color Thus the aunts perceptions of Clares work are distinctly categorized through race

Schalk further suggests that the novel resists these notions of eugenic ideology by emphasizing how characters pass fluidly between racial identities and resist clear categories of identity In the novel Clare Kendry hides her racial identity from her husband and is able travel to places where African Americans are not allowed entry because no one can denote her black heritage from her behavior In addition Irene notes several times in the novel that the physical traits white people assign to African Americans are ridiculous She too is able to pass in places where African Americans are not allowed entry and therefore defies racial categorization The novel resists eugenic distinctions by highlighting the fluid transitions between races

Scholars have treated sexuality with caution and reticence especially during the Harlem Renaissance because the history of slavery and the objectification of the black women Black novelists especially female black novelists had to be more discreet when writing about the sexuality of their characters During this time women especially black women were used as sexual objects Due to sexual objectification black novelists wanted to overcome the legacy of rape They wanted to end the stereotypes of black women as sexual objects and to return to the timidity and modesty of Negro womanhood The writers didnt want to repeat the experience of womens oppression especially AfricanAmerican women McDowell believes that during the Harlem Renaissance female sexuality was acknowledged only in the advertising beauty and fashion industries and sexual pleasure especially for black women leads to the dangers of domination in marriage repeated pregnancy or exploitation and loss of status

According to Scholar Deborah McDowell Larsen wanted to tell the story of black women with sexual desires but the novelist also had to be constrained in that she wanted to establish black women as respectable in black middleclass terms As an example in the novel Irene is portrayed as sexually repressed Irene has a tenuous relationship with her husband Brian In fact they have separate rooms McDowell believes that Irene is confused by her sexual feelings for Clare which are much more apparent McDowell argues that the story is about Irenes awakening sexual desire towards Clare

Scholars have identified a homoerotic subtext between Irene and Clare centered on the erotic undertones in Irenes descriptions of Clare and appreciation of her beauty As scholar Deborah McDowells writes the idea of bringing sexual attraction between two women to full narrative expression is likewise too dangerous a move which helps to explain why critics have missed this aspect of the novel In that interpretation the novels central metaphor of passing under a different identity occurs at a surprisingly wide variety of levels including sexual This suggests that there are other forms of passing that take place in the novel that are not just based on race Larsen has a clever way of deriving its surface theme and central metaphorpassing disguising the plots neatly and symmetrically The apparently sexless marriage between Brian and Irene their separate bedrooms and identification as coparents rather than sexual partners allows Larsen to flirt if only by suggestion with the idea of a lesbian relationship between Clare and Irene In the novel these sexual innuendos appear when Irene first lays eyes on Clare at the rooftop of the Drayton Hotel The novel describes Clare as a sweetly scented woman in a fluttering dress of green chiffon whose mingled pattern of narcissuses jonquils and hyacinths was a reminder of pleasantly chill spring days These flowers symbolize the attraction Irene has for Clare Jonquils and narcissuses both represent excessive interest in ones physical appearance This alludes to Irenes obsession and physical attraction for Clare As the novel states from the very beginning of their reencounter Irene is drawn to Clare like a moth to a flame

The character of her husband Brian has been subject to a similar interpretation Irenes labeling of him as queer and his oftexpressed desire to go to Brazil a country then widely thought to be more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States was are given as evidence It is also shown that Brazil is considered to be a place with more relaxed ideas about race Irene begins to believe that Clare and Brian are having an affair to hide or distract from her own feelings for Clare McDowell writes the awakening of Irenes erotic feelings for Clare coincides with Irenes imagination of an affair between Clare and Brian Although she had no reason to accuse him Irene did so to protect herself from her own sexual desires

Scholars such as Claudia Tate and Helena Michie suggest there is a theme of jealousy throughout the novel Both point to Irenes jealousy in terms of her appreciation for Clares charisma and desirable appearance in the novel As Clare meets Irene to go to the Negro Welfare League dance Irene feels dowdy and commonplace in comparison to Clare who she sees as exquisite golden fragrant flaunting The scholars stress that there are two aspects to this jealousy with Irene exhibiting both bitterness in her perception of Clare and simultaneously feelings of affection and desire for her Helena Michie categorizes the relationship as sororophobic a term she defines as a fear of ones sister While Irene expresses jealousy in her admiration of Clares beauty and social charms she is also susceptible to their seduction and eventually begins to suspect that her husband Brian might be influenced by them as well In her intensifying suspicions Irenes jealousy develops into a fear of losing her family and with it the identity she has built for herself as a middle class black woman Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not She was caught between two allegiances different yet the same Herself Her race Race The thing that bound and suffocated her Whatever steps she took or if she took none at all something would be crushed A person or the race Clare herself or the race Or it might be all three Nothing she imagined was ever more completely sardonic Larsen uses jealousy as the main source of conflict in the novel and uses race as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clares true racial identity to remove Clare from her life and regain that security she desires more than anything Albeit she feels jealousy and fear out of loyalty for her race Irene does not follow through with her thoughts of exposing Clare

While the novel primarily focuses on Irenes feelings of jealousy Clare is also shown to be envious of Irene Unlike Irene however Clare exhibits jealousy towards Irenes lifestyle Clare perceives Irene as being close to her blackness and her community a state that Clare has previously chosen to leave behind but strives to experience again As Clare and Irene converse during Clares first visit to Irenes home Clare expresses her loneliness to Irene contrasting her view of Irenes condition to Clares own feelings of isolation How could you know How could you Youre free Youre happy Clare expresses her own jealousy outwardly even as the novel centers on Irenes inner turmoil

Scholars such as Catherine Rottenberg examine how Larsens characters struggle against race and gender norms of whiteness in the United States Rottenberg shows how the main characters in the novel confront normative characteristics of white culture Clare who is of mixed race chooses to identify with the white culture Irene who identifies as an African American chooses to pass when she feels the need to blend into white culture The essence of Rottenbergs scholarship shows how the novels characters struggle against the desire for whiteness because of the positive stereotypes society has created around white identity Clares experience growing up with her white aunts who treated her as a servant directly impacts Clares initial desire towards whiteness Hence she passes as a white woman marries a white man and forgets her AfricanAmerican culture Even though as a society the white race is the desirable race Rottenberg explains how there are limitations put into place so the inferior race can never fully be white For example Clare has this desire to pass as a white woman because she believes that is the only way she will have a social power but after reconnecting with her childhood friend Irene she begins to struggle with her misplaced desire for whiteness and returns to her AfricanAmerican identification Seeing Irene sparks a desire in Clare to get back in touch with her AfricanAmerican culture Similarly Irene identifies as black but because she desires to feel safe and in control at all times in her life she chooses to pass over only on occasion Irenes desire to be white comes from her wanting the middleclass lifestyle because it will give her the security she needs Irene doesnt want to put herself into a dangerous situation which in a way makes her feel like her marriage and the life she knows at risk Throughout Larsens novel Rottenberg explains how Clare has evolved from wanting to achieve whiteness to reconnecting with the AfricanAmerican culture while Irene still has a desire to achieve whiteness for the feel secure

Scholars such as Andrew W Davis and Zahirah Sabir acknowledge Irenes psychology of safety and security which likely originated from the threat of racism surrounding her family In the novel Irene states that she places security as the first priority in her life on top of race and friendship in the novel

Davis states that the reason that Irene prioritizes security is she wants to protect her children from the social prejudices of the time In addition Irene wants Brian her husband to stay in New York as a doctor to provide security for her children When Brian desires to leave for Brazil Irene is anxious due to the fact that New York is still a white society and is a familiar to her as an AfricanAmerican middleclass woman Clares presence in Irenes life is a threat to this security It makes Irene sense the insecurity of her marriage with her husband Brian And it makes her acknowledge the reality of questions of race and class that surround her and her childrens life

Passing was published in April 1929 by Knopf in New York City Sales of the book were modest Knopf produced three small print runs each under 2000 copies While early reviews were primarily positive it received little attention beyond New York City

Comparing it to Larsens previous novel Quicksand Alice DunbarNelsons review in The Washington Eagle began by declaring that Nella Larsen delights again with her new novel Writer and scholar W E B Du Bois hailed it as the one of the finest novels of the year and believed that its limited success was due to its treating a forbidden subject the marriage of a white man to a mixedrace girl who did not reveal her ancestry

A common criticism of the novel is that it ends too suddenly without a full exploration of the issues it raises Mary Rennels writing in the New York Telegram said Larsen didnt solve the problem of passing Knocking a character out of a scene doesnt settle a matter An anonymous reviewer for the New York Times Book Review similarly concluded that the most serious fault with the book is its sudden and utterly unconvincing closebut otherwise considered it an effective treatment of the topic On the other hand DunbarNelson found that the ending confirmed to the reader that you have been reading a masterpiece all along

In modern scholarship Larsen is recognized as one of the central figures in the AfricanAmerican feminist and modernist canons a reputation that is based on her two novels Passing and Quicksand and some short stories As of 2007 Passing is the subject of more than 200 scholarly articles and more than 50 dissertations which offer a range of critical interpretations It has been hailed as a text helping to create a modernist psychological interiority challenging marriage and middleclass domesticity complexly interrogating gender race and sexual identity and for redeploying traditional tropessuch as that of the tragic mulattawith a contemporary and critical twist However literary critic Cheryl Wall summarizes the critical response to Passing as less favorable than to Larsens first novel Quicksand citing the views of Amaritjit Singh in The Novels of the Harlem Renaissance 99 of Robert Bone in The Negro Novel in America 102 and of Hoyt Fuller in his Introduction to Passing 14 On one hand the significance of sexual jealousy in the story has been seen to detract from the topic of racial passing conversely even if racial passing is accurately treated in the novel it is considered a historically specific practice and so Passing appears dated and trivial

Aratinga
Aratinga is a genus of South American conures Most are predominantly green although a few are predominantly yellow or orange They are social and commonly seen in groups in the wild In Brazil the popular name of several species usually is jandaia sometimes written as jandaya in the scientific form

Many species from this genus are popular pets although being larger than the members of the genus Pyrrhura they need a sizable aviary to thrive

The taxonomy of this genus has recently been resolved by splitting it in four genera as the genus as previously defined was paraphyletic The species of the Aratinga solstitialis complex were retained in this genus while other former Aratinga species were moved to Eupsittula brownishthroated species Psittacara palebeaked species and Thectocercus bluecrowned parakeet Furthermore the closely related nanday parakeet A nenday and the duskyheaded parakeet A weddellii are placed in this genus The nanday parakeet was previously placed in its own genus based on the differences in coloration and elongated upper mandible but this was not supported by phylogenetic studies that showed a close relationship with the A solitarius complex species

JeanBaptiste Labat described a population of small parrots living on Guadeloupe which has been postulated to be a separate species based on little evidence They were called Conurus labati and are now referred to as the Guadeloupe parakeet Aratinga labati No specimens or remains of the extinct parrots are known Their taxonomy may never be fully elucidated so their postulated status as a separate species is hypothetical and it is regarded as a hypothetical extinct species

Colias
Colias is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae They are often called clouded yellows the North American name sulphurs is elsewhere used for Coliadinae in general The closest living relative is the genus Zerene which is sometimes included in Colias
This genus occurs throughout the Holarctic including the arctic regions They are also found in South America Africa China and India Their caterpillars feed on certain Fabaceae for example vetches Vicia While most are thus beneficial by keeping weeds at bay some occasionally become nuisance pests on crops like alfalfa In some species the wings of males have brilliant ultraviolet reflection while those of females do not Adults of both sexes have various colour forms

Most if not all species of this genus as usual for Coliadinae do not sequester toxins or other noxious compounds from their food plants They are therefore a wellloved prey item of insectivores as compared to Pieris of the related Pierinae They make up this disadvantage by being more nimble and better able to evade attacks by wouldbe predators

Notable lepidopterologists who did many studies on this genus included Julius Rber J Malcolm Fawcett George B Johnson and Henry RowlandBrown

Hybridization runs rampant in these polytypic and clinal butterflies confounding molecular phylogenetics studies In general cladistic analyses of only one type of data particularly mtDNA sequences cannot be considered reliable Regardless the evolutionary distance within some species is so large that cryptic speciation rather than or in addition to interbreeding seems to be the cause For example the Beringian populations traditionally assigned to the northern clouded yellow C hecla could warrant recognition as a species hybridization between North American and Asian populations seems to have played a role in their evolution but as a whole they appear to be a rather old and distinct lineage

Listed alphabetically


Colias are usually some shade of yellow orange or white Their uppersides feature black borders usually solid in males often with pale spots in females They always perch with wings closed but upperside pattern may be seen faintly through the wing or glimpsed in flight

Wilcox Crittenden Mill
The Wilcox Crittenden Mill also known as Wilcox Crittenden Mill Historic District is a property in Middletown Connecticut that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 It was the location of the Wilcox Crittenden company a marine hardware firm The historic district listing included four contributing buildings and three other contributing sites

The mill complex consists of four surviving mill buildings built between 1814 and 1917 and foundational remnants of others as well as two brownstone dams Mill A built in 1814 to house weaving operations was converted into an office when larger facilities were built Mill B located to its north is long and was built between 1901 and 1912 Mill C is a concrete block structure built in 1907 and is long Mill D stands across the ravine of Pamachea Creek from Mill C and is the youngest of the four buildings

This building is sited on the north bank of Pameacha Creek It is located in a commercial and industrial area and faces the busy intersection of Warwick and South Main Streets Nearby are related later factory buildings A modern solarenergized bank is located across the intersection to the west

The main part of this structure was erected in 1814 by John Watkinson as a woolen factory Pamecha Creek was a prime source of water power in Middletown a mill had occupied this site since the 1650s Following Watkinsons death in 1836 this building was occupied by another woolen business known as The Pamecha Manufacturing Company

In 1849 William Walter Wilcox a young and aggressive factory worker went into business with Ira Penfield his employer Together they continued manufacturing Penfields recently patented grommet a small metal device used in the raising and lowering of sails in the basement of this building and established the firm of Penfield and Wilcox Wilcox then went on the road successfully selling this new device and establishing a coasttocoast reputation When Penfield retired in 1857 Wilcox took in Joseph Hall Jr as a partner and the firm known as Wilcox and Hall was established Hall left the business in 1867 in 1869 the firm acquired the name by which it has been known for over one hundred years The Wilcox Crittenden and Company The firms prominent managers at this time were William Walter Wilcox Albert R Crittenden a former Middletown Mayor E Bound Chaffee and Homer Churchill This firm brought force and strength to the ships chandlery business They constructed additions to the existing structures to meet their rapidly growing needs Their success was attributed to honesty paying close attention to the business and having a good understanding of maritime needs

On a summer night in 1907 a devastating fire attacked the premises Virtually every building and its contents on Pamecha ravine was destroyed except for a small brick structure and the addition to the south This determined firm rebuilt within two years without losing a customer or laying off an employee Except for this building and a slightly larger and later structure on the south side of the Pamecha Creek all the structures related to the firm were built after the 1907 fire

This story brick structure displays some of its early exterior features brownstone sills and lintels and two corbelled chimneys The windows on the west facade were lengthened the brownstone lintels removed and replaced by segmentalarched brick lintels The cupola was replaced The wing attached to its south wall probably dates deom the late 19th century More decorative it displays corbelled brick work and an unusual arched window on the west facade A large mural of a clipper ship is painted on the south wall

The Pamecha Creek played an important role in Middletowns early manufacturing operations The many waterpowered factories located on its banks were largely responsible for this citys industrial prosperity in the early nineteenth century This building is one of the few survivors of that prosperous era

The site is additionally significant as an archeological site Not only has it been in continuous use since 1650 but documents indicate that much of the machinery and tools damaged in the 1907 fire were not removed from the steep ravine

The property has been converted into an apartment building and is in good condition

Meinoud Rost van Tonningen
Meinoud Marinus Rost van Tonningen 19 February 1894  6 June 1945 was a Dutch politician of the National Socialist Movement NSB During the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II he collaborated extensively with the German occupation forces He was the husband of Florentine Rost van Tonnigen

Meinoud Marinus Rost van Tonningen was born on 19 February 1894 on the island of Java in the city of Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies presentday Indonesia He was the son of KNIL general Marinus Bernardus Rost van Tonningen who had distinguished himself suppressing the revolts against Dutch rule on Lombok Aceh and Bali After high school he completed legal studies at the University of Leiden

In the periods 19231928 and 19311936 he was representative of the League of Nations in Vienna His job was to monitor the Austrian financial policy While stationed in Vienna he developed strong antisemitic and anticommunist convictions He became close friends with Engelbert Dollfuss who became Chancellor of Austria in 1932 and who was murdered in 1934

He became a member of the NSB on 7 August 1936 after returning from Austria He won a seat in Parliament in the elections that year and became the leader of his parliamentary party in the Dutch House of Representatives

He also became editorinchief of the NSB party newspaper Het Nationale Dagblad which he made into a vessel of his own ideas to the dismay of the NSB party leadership Rost van Tonningen was obsessed with Germany and the Greater German Idea while Anton Mussert the leader of the NSB had more affinity with the idea of Fascism as carried out by Benito Mussolini in Italy

It was mainly Rost van Tonningens influence that caused the NSB to become more openly antisemitic Rost van Tonningens antisemitism was more radical than NSB leader Anton Mussert Because of his influence the NSB became closer to the German Nazi Party the NSDAP

1939 saw Rost van Tonningen establish the paramilitary organisation  the Mussert guards Many members of this organisation later became members of the Nederlandsche SS Rost van Tonningens request to be admitted as a member of the SS Westland regiment was at first denied because he had been born in the Dutch East Indies and was unable to obtain documents showing that his family had 150 years of pure Aryan blood However from 1943 Indos Dutch Eurasians could join the lower ranks of the Waffen SS Whereas those deemed to be Native Indonesians with no or little European ancestry were still not allowed In 1944 Rost van Tonningen again applied for membership of the SS and was admitted

During the German occupation of the Netherlands Rost van Tonningen was appointed liquidation commissar for all Marxist organisations by Arthur SeyssInquart the Austrian administrator for the Netherlands

This was targeted especially at the Social Democratic Workers Party SDAP the Revolutionary Socialist Party RSAP and the Communist Party CPN The CPN had to be liquidated the SDAP had to be reconstructed based on National Socialist doctrine This reconstruction failed because the SDAP had destroyed most of its archives and administration papers

The SDAP leadership refused to cooperate and during regional meetings of the SDAP it was announced that the SDAP would not collaborate with the German occupation forces Virtually all SDAP affiliated organisations refused to cooperate with Rost van Tonningens attempts to nazify them Most organisations eg Labourers Sports Association musical organisations chose to dissolve themselves rather than become part of the Nazi hierarchy On 5 July 1941 the SDAP was disbanded together with all other remaining political parties

On 26 March 1941 Rost van Tonningen was appointed to the posts of SecretaryGeneral of the Finance ministry and President of the Dutch National Bank the Nederlandsche Bank During his tenure in these functions the Germans held the Netherlands financially responsible for the costs of the occupation of their country The total cost of this to the Dutch society was calculated by the Dutch government after the war as being 9488000000 Reichsmark Besides this amount an amount of 5750000000 Reichsmark of loans made by the Netherlands to Germany was never repaid so a total amount of 14500000000 Reichsmark flowed to Germany Comparison France 43250000000 and Belgium 11070000000

On 1 April 1941 the currency barriers between the Netherlands and the Third Reich were removed and on 1 September 1941 the last obstructions in the currency markets between the two countries were finally removed This meant that the Germans could trade the gold of the Dutch National Bank for paper Reichsmarks

The other financial heads of occupied territories were not as eager as Rost van Tonningen to remove the barriers and the Netherlands could not spend the Reichsmarks obtained in this way to pay these other countries The other territories brought their Reichsmarks to the Netherlands to pay their foreign debt Germany Denmark Hungary and Occupied France all paid their debts in this way This and the purchase of Dutch goods for Reichsmarks by the Germans made the Dutch balance of Reichsmarks grow from 83000000 March 1941 to 3646000000 September 1941 Rost van Tonningen in the meantime kept printing large amounts of Dutch money This led to large inflation figures

As SecretaryGeneral for Special Economic Affairs Rost van Tonningen was involved in the establishment of the Nederlandse Oostcompagnie Dutch East Company an organisation involved in the reconstruction of the Ukraine The efforts of this company were an abysmal failure

On 5 September 1944 Dolle Dinsdag Mad Tuesday Rost van Tonningen fled with a number of other Dutch Collaborators fearing the rapidly advancing Allied armies He turned up again a few days later but was fired from his position as successor to the NSB leadership by Anton Mussert after writing an article in which he praised the members of the Dutch NSB youth organisation Nationale Jeugdstorm National Youth Storm who had joined the Hitlerjugend division

In the summer of 1944 Rost van Tonningen was trained to be an officer in the first battalion of the Landstorm Nederland a Dutch paramilitary defense organisation In March 1945 he left for the frontlines which ran through the middle of the Netherlands in the Betuwe On 8 May 1945 he was taken prisoner by Canadian troops and was held in a prisoner camp in Elst From there he was transferred to Utrecht and on 24 May 1945 he was moved to the prison in Scheveningen Rost van Tonningen allegedly committed suicide there by jumping from a balcony in the prison on 6 June 1945 There have been persistent rumors but no proof that he did not jump by himself He never stood trial for his actions

His second wife Florentine Rost van Tonningen continued to promote proGerman and National Socialist views denying the Holocaust and regretting the fall of the Third Reich and any threat to racial purity One of their sons Ebbe Rost van Tonningen published a memoir in 2012 about his childhood In Niemandsland In no mans land

Combat Arms Training and Maintenance
Combat Arms Training and Maintenance CATM or simply Combat Arms are United States Air Force Security Forces personnel who train base populace on the use of small arms oversee maintain and repair all small arms in the US Air Force inventory AFSC 3P0X1B SEI 312 TSgt and above are Security Forces personnel who completed the 7 week Combat Arms Apprentice Course Lackland AFB and conduct marksmanship training to prepare all Air Force personnel for home station and deployment operations Combat Arms specialists lead manage supervise and implement small arms weapons training programs Their duties include operating firing ranges and associated facilities enforcing range safety inspectingrepairing weaponry performing preventative maintenance developingutilizing training aides and determining trainingmaintenance resource requirements Combat Arms personnel also provide training in safeguarding weapons ammunition and equipment instructing small arms weapons qualification training and providing guidance on weapons placement to SF and other ground defense force commanders Combat Arms Instructors are the Air Forces small arms weapons Subject Matter Experts SME

During the Korean War several incidents occurred which called attention to the small arms training provided to Air Force personnel The most significant was the tragedy at Kimpo Air Base Korea which was overrun by a numerically superior Chinese communist force The Air Police Squadron was so overwhelmed that they were forced to fight a rear guard action before being annihilated The general base population was then easily defeated before reinforcements arrived to drive the enemy back The remaining personnel found alive by the Chinese were hanged in the main hangar on Kimpo This hangar still stands today as a memorial to those who died without a chance to fight

The resulting investigation revealed serious deficiencies in the way small arms training was perceived and carried out in the Air Force Prior to the Korean War no formal program of weapons training existed One result was the inability of the majority of personnel at Kimpo to successfully defend themselves and the base The majority of the base weapons were inoperable due to lack of maintenance The few serviceable ones were of little use as personnel were not trained in their use unable to even load or aim them Only the Air Police were routinely trained in marksmanship and maintenance of small arms

Please note not everyone agrees the Kimpo Massacre occurred The US Air Force Police Alumni Association website addresses this claim on their website httpwwwusafpoliceorgkoreahtml

The experience of the Korean War encouraged General LeMay then Vice Chief of Staff and former Strategic Air Command commander to pursue a course that was to change the way weapons training was received by Air Force personnel In 1958 twentyfive experienced USAF competitive shooters were selected to become the initial instructor cadre of the USAF Marksmanship Center located at Lackland Air Force Base Texas The marksmanship program was designed by Colonel Tom Kelly former Commander of Holloman Air Force Base New Mexico and under the direction of Colonel Peter W Agnell The initial cadre attended the US Armys advanced rifle marksmanship coaches class at Fort Benning Georgia from 26 January to 15 February 1958 The threeweek training course included coaching techniques range management and procedures for the preparation of marksmanship training programs The purpose of the initial cadre was to train Small Arms instructors and gunsmiths for assignment to all Air Force bases With these personnel as a core for the newly formed USAF Marksmanship Center bases throughout the world began selecting personnel to be sent to the center for training On 5 November 1958 the first class was conducted consisting of 32 students The initial course was 12 weeks in duration and graduated qualified Small Arms instructors who returned to their bases to establish local Marksmanship Programs The new instructors were awarded the Air Force Specialty Code AFSC 753X0 and the expanded program included intensive training for aircrews Air Police Air Base Defense personnel to improve the overall weapons capability of all Air Force personnel

In 1965 the USAF Marksmanship units name was formally changed to Small Arms Marksmanship Training Unit SAMTU This change designated what weapons the career field was responsible to train Besides meeting local training objectives and conducting competitive rifle and pistol matches Small Arms specialists set up and operated specialty courses The USAF Sniper School located at Fort Campbell Kentucky was one of these and existed from 1965 to 1967 Its purpose was to train personnel to carry out their assigned duties effectively in the Republic of Vietnam There was also a 72hour Southeast Asia SEA course in operation through 1971 Its purpose was to prepare all Air Force personnel en route to Southeast Asia NOTE Some Air Force Snipers who were assigned to the Air Commando units and were not instructors were sent to the Marine Sniper School during 19651968

Control of the marksmanship program moved from Washington DC to Randolph Air Force Base Texas in 1978 This move was to enhance the program management The career field again felt another change in 1982 when it was functionally restructured to report to the Air Force Office of Security Police With this change came the re designation to Combat Arms Training and Maintenance CATM

On November 1 1993 the AFSC was changed to more closely align the career field with the Security Police career field The new designation was 3P1X1 for CATM instructors and 3P1X1A for gunsmiths The career field also shared the same functional badge with Security Police and the Office of Special Investigations OSI which designated the basic level the 7level and Senior NCO Academy graduate level Since then the career field again changed and Combat Arms instructors were merged with Security Forces in 1997 with the first graduating Security Forces Class on 10 April 1997 becoming Security Forces first and Combat Arms as a shredout of the AFSC The new inclusive Security Apprentice course L3ABR3P031000 became the norm with training at Lackland AFB San Antonio Texas CATM instructors now have the AFSC of 3P0X1B through the rank of SSgt and are designed SEI 312 as TSgt and above

Since the introduction of the Airmans Creed in 2007 by General T Michael Mosele all other creeds are officially unrecognized by the Air Force
This also includes the Security Forces Creed

Hang instrument
The Hang  plural form Hanghang is a musical instrument in the idiophone class created by Felix Rohner and Sabina Schrer in Bern Switzerland The name of their company is PANArt Hangbau AG The Hang is sometimes referred to as a hang drum but the inventors consider this a misnomer and strongly discourage its use
The instrument is constructed from two halfshells of deep drawn nitrided steel sheet glued together at the rim leaving the inside hollow and creating the shape of a convex lens The top Ding side has a center note hammered into it and seven or eight tone fields hammered around the center The bottom Gu is a plain surface that has a rolled hole in the center with a tuned note that can be created when the rim is struck

The Hang uses some of the same basic physical principles as a steelpan but modified in such a way as to act as a Helmholtz resonator The creation of the Hang was the result of many years of research on the steelpan and other instruments The inventors of the Hang have continued to refine the shape and materials and have produced several variations over the years

The name Hang comes from a Bernese German word which has a doublemeaning one of which is hand and the other hillside referring to its convex shape It is a registered trademark and property of PANArt Hangbau AG

Growth of a worldwide interest in the Hang created a group of similar instruments which are referred to as handpans a term coined in 2007 by the American steelpan producer Pantheon Steel

The Hang is typically played resting on the players lap The Hang is generally played with the hands and fingers instead of mallets This lighter means of playing produces an overtonerich sound that could be considered softer and warmer than the bright sound of a malletbased traditional steelpan

The top Ding side of the Hang depending on how it is played can sound like a harp bells or harmonically tuned steelpans The notes are laid out in a cross pattern in the tone circle from low to high so that with a specific orientation of the Hang the player can ascend or descend the scale by alternating using the left and right hands to strike the tone fields Each tone field has multiple overtones oriented specifically in the flattened field with a dome at the center Typically there is a fundamental tone an overtone tuned to an octave above that fundamental and an additional overtone a perfect fifth above that octave twelfth or tritave The orientation is fairly consistent across the fields on each Hang so that the overtones can be highlighted muted or extracted based on how and where the player strikes the tone field

The bottom side of the Hang has a round opening the Gu producing together with the air in the cavity a Helmholtz resonance similar to a ghatam or an udu In the second generation Integral Hang and Free Integral Hang adjustment of the size of the Gu by partially blocking it with either a hand or the legs can generate a sympathetic D from the Helmholtz resonance which introduces subtle layers of cross complexities in the resonance of the instrument as notes are played on the Ding side In the first and secondgeneration models there is a single high note with a long sustain that can be generated by striking the rim of the hole on the Gu side In the Integral Hang there are two notes that can be generated F and F The Hang can also be used as a friction idiophone Shakerlike sounds can be made by sliding a hand across the surface and it can also ring like a singing bowl by using skin a hand or a bow

The Hang was developed in the year 2000 and introduced at the Musikmesse Frankfurt in 2001 It is in diameter and has a height of  The two deep drawn steel hemispheres of the Hang are hardened by a process known as gas nitridization The side considered the bottom has an opening Gu in the center which allows the generation of the bass note through Helmholtz resonance When it is played in a damped way it can change in pitch similar to a talking drum On the top are seven or eight notes arranged in a tone circle in zigzag fashion from low to high All are tuned harmonically with fundamental octave and the fifth above the octave around a low note Ding at the center of the tone circle Each creation is numbered and signed

There are only two people who built Hanghang the inventors Felix Rohner and Sabina Schrer They have a small workshop in Bern where every Hang has been created

From 2001 to 2005 the first generation Hang was offered in multiple scales ranging up to 45 different sound models The Hang makers took their initial inspiration from ethnomusicological roots with models such as the Aeolian Ake Bono Hijaz Melog Pygmy and Zhi Diao From 2001 to 2004 each Hang had eight tone fields in the circle In 2005 PANArt was able to lower the tones on the Hang significantly in what they referred to as the Low Hang with the Ding tuned to F E or E It was offered in two versions with eight or seven tone fields in the circle In the first generation each creation was numbered the name of the sound model was written and a signature of either Felix Rohner or Sabina Schrer was on a small note pasted on the inside of the top Ding surface

In the spring of 2006 the Hang makers presented a new generation of Hang The new generation instruments often referred to as second generation have a surface coating of annealed brass over the nitrided steel as well as a ring of brass around the circumference of the Hang From the many different scales the Hang makers reduced to a structure with one type of central note Ding at D All new generation models have two A notes A and A as well as another D D in the tone circle around the Ding The remaining notes were mixed into several different configurations The majority of second generation Hanghang were built with seven tone fields in the circle Older Hanghang had tone fields with the oval indentation oriented radially towards the Ding with the 2007 models as well as the Integral Hang the tone fields are angled at about 45 from a line drawn from the Ding to the edge They also started marking the individual serial number on the inside of the Gu opening and signing each Hang at the outside edge of the Gu side of the Hang No sound model names were officially given to the second generation models

In the spring of 2008 the Hang makers announced a new version the Integral Hang Numbers began again with an H in front H1 H2 etc and with the first Integral Hang dated in November 2007 Several changes marked the Integral Hang There was only one scale with seven tone fields in the cycle D Ding A B C D E F A and no other sound models offered The Gu hole was adjusted to a subtly oval shape to improve the tuning of the three partials D F and an F of the Gu neck Significant changes were made to the Ding center note on the top A circular indentation in the dome was made and has a texture of brass applied annealed and then lacquered Also changes to the shoulder area between the flattened area of the Ding and the notes in the tone circle were implemented so that the transition was more gradual than in the 2nd generation Hanghang The PANArt logo serial number date of finalization and signatures of the Hang makers were placed on Gu side of the Hang near the equator where the two shells meet

By developing the Integral Hang Rohner and Schrer distanced themselves from the idea of building an instrument for the needs of professional musicians Their aims and ambitions were published in a Letter from the Hangbauhaus 

This model has been available since April 2010 Compared to its predecessor the Free Integral Hang features a few construction changes First of all there is no longer a brass ring around the seam connecting the ding and gu shells Furthermore the dome of the ding is not brasscoated anymore and is characterized by a double offset a triple dome The Free Integral Hanghang are tuned without the use of tuning devices The pitch of the Ding differs from one instrument to another and varies around the tone D The tones in the tone circle relative to the Ding correspond to those of the Integral Hang

In the free tuning of a Hang the focus is not about the precise mathematical frequency ratios of the partials of a tone field but on the impact of the entire sound Trinidads steelpan tuners already slightly detuned partial tones to attain the characteristic sound of their own instruments In an acousticmathematical analysis Anthony Achong substantiated that this detuning is the most important parameter in influencing the structure of a steelpan tone the duration of the partials as well as the amplitude and frequency modulations By foregoing a tuning device for the Free Integral Hang the Hang tuners are free to systematically make use of this parameter and to concentrate on the artistic design of the sound structure during the entire tuning process

As of December 2013 PANArt announced that the Hang would no longer be made as the PANArt tuners were completely concentrated on a new different instrument the Gubal In the following years PANArt developed a number of other instruments called Hang Gudu Hang Urgu Hang Bal and Hang Gede as well as a number of string instruments and created a collective improvised music form played with these Pang instruments

On 3 May 1821 Napoleon gave instructions that should he become insensible no English physician but Arnott was to touch him Napoleon died on 5 May 1821 and Arnott attended his postmortem examination The Emperor bequeathed Arnott six hundred Napoleons and the British government gave him an additional payment of five hundred pounds

The 17th congressional district has shifted northward after the 2012 redistricting It lost Quincy and Decatur as well as its share of Springfield It was generally thought that the redrawn map would allow the district to revert to the Democrats who held it without interruption from 1983 to 2011 As expected oneterm Republican incumbent Bobby Schilling was defeated by Democratic opponent Cheri Bustos in the 2012 election cycle

The district covers parts of Peoria Tazewell and Winnebago counties and all of Carroll Fulton Henderson Henry Jo Daviess Knox Mercer Rock Island Stephenson Warren and Whiteside counties as of the 2011 redistricting which followed the 2010 census All or parts of Canton East Moline Freeport Galesburg Kewanee Moline Peoria Rock Island Rockford Pekin and Sterling are included The representatives for these districts were elected in the 2012 primary and general elections and the boundaries became effective on January 5 2013

From 2003 to 2013 the district was known as the rabbit on a skateboard for its unusual shape devised as the outcome of gerrymandering The boundaries were drawn in a bipartisan deal to protect both Democratic incumbent Lane Evans and neighboring Republican incumbents The lines of the district were drawn to move Republican voters into neighboring districts and to include Democratic neighborhoods in Springfield and Decatur

Les ftes dHb
Les ftes dHb ou Les talens lyriques The Festivities of Hebe or The Lyric Talents is an opraballet in a prologue and three entres acts by the French composer JeanPhilippe Rameau The libretto was written by Antoine Gautier de Montdorge 17071768 The work was first performed on 21 May 1739 by the Acadmie royale de musique at its theatre in the PalaisRoyal in Paris

Les ftes dHb was Rameaus second operaballet his first Les Indes galantes had appeared in 1735 It was first performed at the Paris Opra on 21 May 1739 The famous dancer Marie Sall appeared as Terpsichore in the third entre Montdorge was a friend of Rameaus patron Alexandre Le Riche de La Poupelinire His libretto came in for heavy criticism and the second entre had to be revised with the aid of SimonJoseph Pellegrin who had written the words for Rameaus first opera Hippolyte et Aricie In spite of the weak libretto the work was an immediate success and became one of Rameaus most popular operas enjoying 80 performances in its first year It was revived in 1747 1756 and 1764 with set designs supervised by Franois Boucher and the role of Iphise taken by Sophie Arnould Thereafter 18th century productions only gave partial versions of the work

Les ftes dHb takes the form of a typical opra ballet a series of selfcontained acts loosely based around a theme in this the case the lyric arts of poetry music and dance

Hebe is harassed by the unwanted attentions of Momus Love suggests she should escape with her to the banks of the River Seine to witness festivities celebrating the arts

On the island of Lesbos the love of the two poets Sappho and Alcaeus is harmed by the jealous Thelemus who persuades King Hymas to banish Alcaeus When the king is out hunting Sappho surprises him and stages an allegorical play for him by which Hymas learns the truth The king pardons Alcaeus and the lovers rejoice

Iphise daughter of Lycurgus King of Sparta is due to be married to Tyrtaeus an accomplished musician as well as a warrior An oracle announces that Iphise must marry the conqueror of the Messenians and Tyrtaeus leads his soldiers into battle against them Iphise views the action in the form of a ballet provided by the oracle Tyrtaeus is victorious and the act ends with general rejoicing

The shepherdess Egl well known for her skill at dancing is due to choose a husband The god Mercury visits her village in disguise and falls in love with her arousing the jealousy of the shepherd Eurilas Egl chooses Mercury and the two celebrate with the help of Terpsichore the muse of dance and her followers

The music has received much praise According to Cuthbert Girdlestone Rameau gave of his best No work of his contains more variety or contains so kaleidoscopically complete a view of his range in lyric tragedy or pastoral Graham Sadler has written Rameau by now at the height of his powers contributes a score of astonishing inventiveness Cest une musique enchante wrote one contemporary with little exaggeration This is especially true of the third entre wonderfully rich in that languorous and often deeply nostalgic music that is one of Rameaus hallmarks

Rameau included orchestrated versions of several of his harpsichord pieces in the score For example Lentretien des Muses in the second entre from the D major suite in the 1724 Pices de Clavessin and the musette and tambourin from the E minor suite in the same book in the third entre

<doc id="7730808" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7730808" title="33 Revolutions per Monkee">
33 Revolutions per Monkee
Although they were billed as musical guests Julie Driscoll and Brian Auger alongside their thenbacking band The Trinity found themselves playing a prominent role in fact it can be argued that the special focused more on the guest stars specifically Auger and Driscoll than the Monkees themselves This special is notable as the Monkees final performance as a quartet until 1986 as Peter Tork left the group at the end of the specials production

The title is a play on revolutions per minute

The story follows Brian Auger and his assistant Driscoll as they take The Monkees through various stages of evolution until they are ready to brainwash the world via commercial exploitation Trapped in giant test tubes the four are stripped of all personal identity and names Micky Dolenz becomes Monkee 1 Peter Tork becomes Monkee 2 Michael Nesmith Monkee 3 and Davy Jones Monkee 4

Each Monkee under Driscolls watch attempts to regain their stripped personal identities by thinking a way out of captivity into their own world of fantasies Monkee 1 Dolenz performs an RB uptempo duet remake of Im a Believer with Driscoll Monkee 2 Tork reclines on a giant cushion in Eastern Garb and to the lilting backing of sitar and tabla performs I Prithee Do Not Ask For Love a gentle number concerning spiritual values Monkee 3 Nesmith in an inventive bluescreen number sings a country tune with himself Naked Persimmon and a toysized Monkee 4 Jones sings and dances to the tune of Goldilocks Sometime

Next the Monkees perform Wind Up Man in the stifflegged form of robots dressed similar to the outfits they debuted in Auger criticizing their performance introduces a fourpart piano harmony in a unique pianostacked set up with Auger and his electric keyboard on top then descending to Jerry Lee Lewis Little Richard and finally Fats Domino on the bottom Disapproving Augers brainwashing method Charles Darwin steps in and inexplicably switches to Paul Arnold and the Moon Express Only The Fittest Shall Survive a psychedelic dance performance Then the Monkees clad in ape costumes perform Neil Sedakas I Go Ape With his work done Darwin allows Auger Driscoll and the Trinity to work from there while singing the Young Rascals Come On Up

With the process complete Auger introduces the Monkees to a gig at the Paramount Theater on December 7 1956 and describing them as idolized plasticized psychoanalyzed and sterilized The four dressed in outlandish 1950s vocal group gear are then immediately launched into a classic 50s rock medley At The Hop Shake A Tail Feather Little Darlin Peppermint Twist backed up by Jerry Lee Lewis Little Richard Fats Domino We Three and The Clara Ward Singers The guest performers contributed their own songs to the medley with the Ward Singers performing Dem Bones as the segments finale Peter Torks girlfriend Reine Stewart stood in as drummer for Fats Domino when his regular drummer couldnt attend

At the end of the medley Auger and Driscoll break character and say that the brainwashing concept has gone out of hand and would rather see The Monkees have complete and total freedom which Driscoll describes as utter bloody shambles

The rest of the special takes place in a warehouse full of instruments and props It begins with Davy standing atop a high staircase performing Bill Dorseys String For My Kite Peter enters the scene next and performs on a Hohner Clavinette harpsichord Solfeggietto by CPE Bach Finally Mike and Micky arrive and perform Listen To The Band with Nesmith on Black Beauty guitar Gibson Les Paul Custom Tork on keyboards Dolenz on drums and Jones on tambourine in what would turn out to be their final appearance as a quartet until 1986 as well as their final network television appearance as a quartet until 1996 As the song progresses they are joined by extras Good sent buses down to Sunset Strip to round up about 100 extras for a party and all of 33 13 Revolutions per Monkeenowikis guest musicians from The Trinity to the Buddy Miles Express resulting in a climactic frantic cacophony similar to the crescendo in nowikiRevolution 9 it pans aside to a book with Chaos is Come Again on the next page The book closes with The Beginning of the End on the back cover

The closing credits feature a reversed scene from the Moon Express dance sequence with Tork singing California Here I Come over the credits as California is nuked killing off the fictional Monkees 

The general opinion of the viewers and participants of  Revolutions per Monkee claim the special to be chaotic both onscreen and offscreen The Monkees went into rehearsals for the program one day after their return from their Australasian tour in October 1968 Production on the program began in November 1968 after completing a press tour promoting their film Head Music sessions with Bones Howe and Michael Nesmith producing commenced in midNovember with the final taping of the special occurring at the end of the month Before production started a strike at NBC almost meant that the special could not be taped however stage space was found at MGM Studios in Culver City and the sets were transported there Because it was a lastminute change of location the special was directed from outdoor broadcast trucks parked outside the soundstages

The Monkees were reportedly angry with producer Jack Good and director Art Fishers script for  Revolutions per Monkee calling it too sloppy too fairytale like while Davy Jones felt that for a TV special starring the Monkees it emphasized rather largely the guest cast over the group itself

Peter Tork in liner notes for The Monkees Anthology CD compilation called  the TV Version of Head Tork was at one point the only Monkee working on Head but ironically enough it would be Tork that would buy out his Monkees contract at the end of production of  Revolutions per Monkee on December 20 1968 reportedly suffering from exhaustion Torks departure reduced The Monkees to a trio and the group would not be seen on network TV as a foursome again until 1997 After production wrapped Tork was given a gold watch as a goingaway present with the inscription To Peter from the guys down at work

Negotiations were originally made in early 1968 for The Monkees to star in three NBCTV specials to air in 1969  Revolutions per Monkee was the first Unhappy with the final edit NBC decided to air it on the West Coast opposite The 41st Academy Awards on ABC Further damage was done to the telecast by an engineer who accidentally presented  Revolutions per Monkee out of sequence These incidents prompted NBC to cancel plans to produce the remaining Monkees specials Because of the technology of the time the Hawaiian broadcast of the special was delayed for two weeks At the time television stations in Hawaii received network programming via film and videotape as there were no telephone connections capable of television broadcasting it was finally shown there on April 28 Its telecast in Great Britain occurred on Saturday May 24 on BBC2


In the 1990s  Revolutions per Monkee was released commercially by Rhino Home Video parent company Rhino Entertainment owns the rights to The Monkees in two different versions The version of  Revolutions per Monkee released individually in January 1997 R3 2284 has been on file for years at The Museum of Television  Radio now known as the Paley Center for Media in New York City with good sound quality a fuzzy picture and the segments in original broadcast order

The DVD version features two commentary tracks one by Brian Auger and the other by Micky Dolenz who has mixed feelings about the program

The special was remastered for the Monkees 50th Anniversary BluRay box set but due to licensing restrictions Whole Lotta Shakin Goin On was edited out from the medley

No official soundtrack has been released nor was such a soundtrack planned because of the technology of the time wherein a singer would sing live vocals over prerecorded tracks It has also been said that many of the songs were left at MGM when production finished Some songs however have been officially released as bonus tracks on recent deluxe editions of Head and Instant Replay The versions of songs with vocals have been lifted directly from the television audio

A number of lowquality demo recordings are known to exist including versions of A String for My Kite and Wind Up Man and unused songs Buttoning the Buttons I Am a Fish Lucky You and The Bus  The Crocodile  all performed by the same musician probably the shows main songwriter Bill Dorsey I Am a Fish was recorded by Tiny Tim under the title The Other Side in 1968 Tracks I Aint No Miracle Worker and I Wish That I Were Dead aka But Now I Find were officiallyreleased singles by The Brogues but have been erroneously listed as demo recordings for  Revolutions per Monkee as has My Community written by Roger Atkins and Carl DErrico which was recorded by Tiny Tim under the title Community in 1968 A vinyl bootleg possibly recorded by placing a microphone in front of a television speaker while the program played was produced by Zilch Records

Public Health Information Network
The Public Health Information Network PHIN is a national initiative developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC for advancing fully capable and interoperable information systems in public health organizations The initiative involves establishing and implementing a framework for public health information systems

PHIN is designed to do the following 

The 5 Functional Areas of PHIN

PHIN attempts to provide the public health sector with continuous access to necessary health care information Access to near realtime data attempts to improve community based interventions that are implemented as a result of terrorism or disease outbreaks

PHIN provides supports and helps improve the outcomes of various public health programs including the following


PHIN first received funding in 2004 through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Between 25 and 30 of the 849 million of funding received through the Public Health Response and Preparedness Cooperative Agreement was to be used to focus on improving public health preparedness in all 50 states 4 metropolitan areas and 8 US territories In 2004 the initiative of the program was to ensure that all public health partners have or at least will have access to a system or systems to accomplish established preparedness functions For year 2005 additional finances will be available to states through the terrorism cooperative agreement This agreement will support the development of current and new systems in state health and public health departments which will meet the PHIN standards and specifications

In order to collect and assess information system requirements for PHIN the CDC works with public health partners some of which include

With the assistance of these partners PHIN can target the following functional areas regarding preparedness

The approval of technical and data standards for PHIN is completed by two working groups in the CDC Information Council CIC The following organizations are represented on each working group by 2 members of its staff Association of State and Territorial Health Officials ASTHO National Association of County and City Health Officials NACCHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC By regulation the standards conform to Department of Health and Human Services HHS requirements and the Federal Health architecture

CIC also ensures that the following standards are met

In the realm of preparedness the PHIN has developed systems to promote early event detection Information systems that connect health care providers to the PHIN allow for rapid reporting of cases that may lead to public health emergencies These information systems include call reporting systems webbased systems and other electronic case reporting systems The PHIN has set up technical requirements so that facilities can be equipped to participate in these rapid reporting systems These requirements also ensure that facilities can protect patient privacy in their reports and ensure integration with outbreak management

Another component in preparedness the PHIN has a division of outbreak management which allows public health agencies to be adequately prepared for true outbreaks The outbreak management system is integrated with the early event detection systems to ensure rapid smooth awareness of outbreaks The CDC and PHIN currently employ an Outbreak Management System software application to effectively manage data related to outbreaks

Another component of PHIN is connecting laboratories through a set of computer communication standards called HL7 This allows specimen receipts and laboratory results to be exchanged between health organizations and agencies This is especially useful in times of a health outbreak or other disaster

The PHIN also works to track and support the supply of vaccinations and as well as the administration of these tasks As part of this functionality the PHIN allows limited supplies of vaccines and other needed drugs to be allocated properly when they are in short supply Some vaccines and drugs will be traceable to clinics and drug administrators PHIN also supports response administration by allowing adverse events to be monitored and quarantined populations to be monitored if necessary

PHIN has a set of Vocabulary Standards and Specifications that

Portuguese Bar Association
The Order of Attorneys of Portugal  also known as the Portuguese Bar Association is the public association to which all attorneysatlaw belong in Portugal founded in 1926 Its early origins are found on a private association founded in 1838 by a group of lawyers from Lisbon

Graduates in law from university who wish to act on behalf of clients before a court of law must register at the Portuguese Bar Association Only those who are duly registered can provide legal consultation and appear before the court Other graduates in law may choose other jobs which do not demand registration at the bar association

Being a public association it is independent from the government but it has some public powers which include disciplinary action over its members Its decisions are subject to judicial impeachment In Portuguese law an attorneyatlaw is known as advogado His job equals that of both solicitors and barristers although Portugal also has a separate profession of solicitor or solicitador

The internship for a Portuguese recently graduated Lawyer to become full member of the Bar includes a complex weeklong exam at first three day long preexams on a Monday Wednesday and Friday then a usually unpaid though sometimes paid internship of eighteen months and finally a last exam for a whole day However after this exam the intern is also subject to an oral exam which is again mandatory

Law courses are available in Portugal in Public or Private Universities though the Public ones are usually more nationally well praised mostly in the Public Sector of the State namely on Public Administration

2007 World Series of Poker
The 2007 World Series of Poker WSOP began on June 1 2007 The 10000 US nolimit Texas hold em Main Event began on July 6 and was completed on the morning of July 18 All events were held at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Nevada by Harrahs Entertainment which has run the annual event since its purchase from the Binion family in 2004

For the first time players began each event with double the amount of chips as the buyin This means that players in the Main Event started with 20000 chips The blind structure has also been increased and some blind levels removed but slowed to allow for more play

In addition to the 50000 HORSE event which was first played at the 2006 World Series of Poker this year there were two additional HORSE events with lower buyins 2500 and 5000

Tom Schneider who won two events and made one other final table won the Player of the Year Award Michael Binger and Chad Brown led all other players with eight money finishes

The annual celebrity event was changed this year as it became a pro and celeb event called Ante Up for Africa hosted by actor Don Cheadle and poker pro Annie Duke The final two players Dan Shak and Brandon Moran agreed to share first place and donate all prize money to charities in Darfur

The last woman standing of the 2007 Main Event was Maria Ho who finished in 38th place

Also this year KEM Plastic Playing Cards were once again used for the events rather than Copag brand plastic playing cards which were used during the 2005 and 2006 World Series of Poker


The 10000 No Limit Holdem Main Event began on July 6 with the first of four separate starting days 6358 players entered 2415 fewer than in 2006 This is the first time since 1992 that the Main Event experienced a reduction in participants As the total number of registrants for the 2007 WSOP set a record at 54288 with a total prize pool of 159796918 59784954 for the Main Event the decrease in the number of participants in the Main Event has been attributed to a recent law that limits Internet gambling As a result of this law Harrahs did not allow online poker websites to directly purchase Main Event seats and offer them as prizes if the sites conducted business with US citizens Online entries to the Main Event that were won as prizes on Internet poker sites were a substantial contributor to the dramatic growth the Main Event seen in 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 The reduced field also meant a nearly onethird reduction in the Main Events grand prize from the record 12 million US in 2006 to 825 million

A flatter payout structure was introduced in 2007 further reducing the prize money awarded to the final table finishers Players who busted early in the money received a larger share than they would have in 2006 The lowest payouts in 2007 were 20320 just over double the buyin as compared to 14597 in 2006 Every player who made the final table in 2006 won over 15 million dollars

A minor controversy arose during the main event The colors of the chips made it very difficult to differentiate between the chip values Pokernewscom posted the following note on its live reporting log It has literally been impossible for us to count these players stacks due to the positioning of the cameras and the incredibly similar colors of the various chip denominations Pokernews also reported that the chip color has affected play Because of the similarlycolored chips it took the dealer some time to count down Klubers stack and not long after Rahme began thinking about his response Kluber called the clock on him Other players have complained that they cant count their opponents stacks and fear asking for a chip count as speaking may reveal the strength of their hand

NB This list is restricted to top 30 finishers with an existing Wikipedia entry


Under the leadership of WSOP commissioner Jeffrey Pollack the World Series of Poker Europe WSOPE is the first expansion of the World Series of Poker In September 2007 the first WSOP championship events outside of Las Vegas took place in London It was the first time that WSOP bracelets were awarded outside of Las Vegas Three tournaments were held with the main event being a 10000 buyin nolimit hold em tournament The main event was won by Norwegian online prodigy Annette Obrestad who won on the day before her 19th birthday and became the youngest person ever to win a WSOP bracelet

Neil Pointon
Neil Geoffrey Pointon born 28 November 1964 is an English former professional footballer Pointon was a leftback who is perhaps best remembered for playing for Everton Manchester City and Oldham Athletic

Pointon began his career at lowerleague Scunthorpe United and quickly established himself as a regular firstteamer and a consistent and reliable performer in defence In the autumn of 1985 after four years at Scunthorpe Pointon was bought by the reigning English league champions Everton for 75000 manager Howard Kendall hoping Pointon could provide squad cover for regular leftback Pat Van Den Hauwe Ultimately Pointon ended up featuring in the majority of Evertons games during the remainder of the 198586 season as a result of Van den Hauwe moving to central defence to cover for the injured centreback Derek Mountfield Everton finished that season as runnersup to local rivals Liverpool in both the league championship and the FA Cup though Pointon played no part in the FA Cup final due to Mountfields return to fitness

In the following season Pointon struggled with injury and had to compete with not only Van den Hauwe but also veteran defender Paul Power signed from Manchester City for the leftback spot at Goodison Pointon did however play enough games that year to qualify for a Championship winners medal as Everton won their second title in three years

Over the next couple of years Pointon was a consistent performer in the Everton defence when called up to the first team although Kendalls departure to Athletic Bilbao and the breakup of the Championship winning side saw a decline in the clubs fortunes During 198990 Pointon became Evertons first choice leftback following the sale of Van den Hauwe to Tottenham Hotspur

In the summer of 1990 Pointon left Everton to rejoin Howard Kendall at his new club Manchester City with Kendall receiving Pointon and 300000 in exchange for Andy Hinchcliffe Pointon spent two years at City as a firstteam regular before moving on to Joe Royles Oldham Athletic then a topflight club Pointon spent three years at Boundary Park during which time the club were relegated from the Premiership

On 10 April 1994 Pointon put the Latics ahead in the 106th minute extra time of the FA Cup semi final at Wembley Stadium against Manchester United only for Mark Hughes to equalise one minute before the final whistle and force a replay The replay at Maine Road saw the Latics lose 41 with Pointon scoring Oldhams consolation goal 
United went on to win both the Premier League title and FA Cup while Pointon and his colleagues had the double misery of an FA Cup exit and Premier League relegation in less than a month During this period Neil made the tabloid papers following a brief liaison with television personality Dani Behr

Pointon joined Scottish Premier Division outfit Heart of Midlothian in 1995 enjoying a number of seasons up in Scotland before later playing for Walsall Chesterfield and Hednesford Town He scored for Hednesford against former club Oldham Athletic in an FA Cup tie at Keys Park soon before being handed the reins as Manager at Hednesford He lasted as little as 9 games in his first Managerial post before being sacked after not winning a single game The club later got relegated but very few fans of the Staffordshire Club actually put the blame with him

After a spell as playermanager of Retford United he joined Mossley as a player and helped Mossley to win the Worthington Challenge Trophy at Gigg Lane Bury with a 21 win over Clitheroe in his last ever professional game

He currently works for Higher Lane Primary School as a sports coach

Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi
Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi c 1714  1787 was a master luthier who was active in the Italian 18th century during the golden age of stringed instrument making

Landolfi is considered among the half dozen finest stringed instrument makers in history along with Stradivarius and Guarneri del Gesu and Pietro Guarneri Instruments created centuries ago by Landolfi and his fellow Italian luthiers have not been improved upon despite modern technology and are still played by the finest violinists and violists in the great concert halls across the world

Landolfi was born in Milan Italy in 1714 and after an apprenticeship in Cremona Italy he returned to Milan in 1734 age 20 and created his workshop As his instrument labels indicate he worked Contrada Santa Margherita al Segno della Sirena in the central metropolis of Italys Lombardy region at the center of the citys busy mercantile and artistic activities

Landolfis career continued in Milan throughout his life

Landolfi may have been the last of the classical Italian master luthiers to use Cremonese methods of construction and of compounding varnishes

For his finest instruments Landolfi chose the woods with exceptional care and used superb varnishes of a particularly striking hue

Landolfis best instruments have similarities to the work of Guarneri del Gesu but the Landolfis have unique characteristics reflecting constant refinement over the course of his career For example Landolfi developed an approach that increased the arching of the belly of each violin and viola with relation to the back And his careful workmanship included scroll carving of a particularly graceful manner often smaller and broader than the work of other master luthiers

Importantly Landolfis most exceptional instruments possess a full tone of great carrying power For that reason over the centuries Landolfis have been prized by solo performers

Musicians who have owned Landolfis include Carl Flesch the Hungarian violinist and teacher 1873  1944 who played both a Landolfi and the Brancaccio Stradivarius

Heterogram literature
A heterogram from hetero meaning different  gram meaning written is a word phrase or sentence in which no letter of the alphabet occurs more than once 

An isogram in which all letters occur an equal number of times is the same as a heterogram when each letter occurs once

A heterogram may be distinguished from a pangram a holoalphabetic sentence which uses all of the letters of the alphabet possibly more than once A perfect heterogram is however the same as a perfect pangram since both consist of all letters of the alphabet with each represented exactly once

Abjads and abugidas in which only the consonants are represented in the basic graphemes have a naturally high incidence of heterograms

There are many thousands of heterograms in English with fewer than 13 letters

9Tenths
9Tenths is a 2006 film directed by Bob Degus and starring Gabrielle Anwar Henry Ian Cusick and Dave Baez The plot concerns the conflict between a wealthy couple and a poor laborer after a worldwide terrorist attack isolates them in a small remote ranch 9Tenths was filmed outside of Los Angeles CA in Canyon Country Its world premiere was at the 2006 Sedona International Film Festival on February 24 2006

The film takes place sometime in the not too distant future where terrorist attacks are on the rise and cities are the primary targets Jessica Gabrielle Anwar and husband William Henry Ian Cusick have fled the city amid the increasing terrorist threats William is excited to relocate to his newly purchased ranch hundreds of miles from nowhere Jessica reluctantly humors her husband and his paranoid fears by going along

On their arrival William and Jessica discover someone already living in their house Elias Dave Baez proves quite an intimidating presence when the couple discovers him in their kitchen butchering a freshly killed animal But Elias soon explains in his broken English that he was the caretaker for the previous owner who had promised to let him continue living there as a reward for his services

William knows of no such arrangement and quickly attempts to get rid of this man he sees as nothing more than a trespasser Elias sees the couple the same way and develops his own ideas about sending them back to the city Meanwhile it quickly becomes obvious that William is of little use in this rustic environment that Elias calls home Even a simple task like fixing a broken water heater is beyond Williams range of expertise I pay people to do these things for me he blurts out Obviously successful in the professional world William is at a loss in his newfound sanctuary Williams frustration festers as he observes Eliass adroitness with such tasks

Just as the property dispute escalates to a dangerous level the three hear parts of an emergency radio broadcast indicating that an extremely large terrorist attack has caused widespread catastrophic destruction in the world around them

The three are cut off from everything completely in the dark as to whether anybody at all is left alive in the area the country or even the world Civilization as they have to know it may have ended

This alters the dynamic between the pampered city couple that are totally invested in what is known as civilization and the selfsufficient Elias As time goes by and the couples supplies diminish Elias formerly a secondclass citizen at best finds himself in a position of power since he is the only one with the skills needed to survive

This change in events brings forward Elias attraction to Jessica which is intertwined with the desperate circumstances leading all three down a frightening and depraved path none would have ever expected

The music score for the film was composed by Brian Ralston The score features 3 solo instruments solo viola solo female soprano and solo flamenco guitar that are symbolic of the three main characters in the film over an orchestral foundation A soundtrack for the film has not yet been released

When his father died in 1707 Ernst August became coruler Mitherr of SaxeWeimar along with his uncle Wilhelm Ernst but his title was only nominal since Wilhelm Ernst was the actual ruler of the duchy Only when Wilhelm Ernst died in 1728 did Ernst August begin to exercise true authority over SaxeWeimar

Ernst August was a splendorloving ruler and his extravagances contributed to the eventual financial ruin of his duchy Desperately in need of funds he resorted to the practice of arresting wealthy subjects without cause and setting them free only after they had renounced their fortunes to the duke or had paid exorbitant ransoms Some of the victims who considered this behaviour illegal made claims against the duke at the Imperial Court in Vienna or in the Imperial Chamber Court of Appeal in Wetzlar Ernst August lost all the legal proceedings mounted against him The process lasted for many years and eventually led to the duchys bankruptcy

The duke maintained a standing army that was disproportionately large for the duchys population or financial resources Some of the soldiers were rented to the Electorate of Saxony or to the Holy Roman Emperor Ernst Augusts mania for building led to the construction of the Kleinode the small Schloss Belvedere and the Rococo Schloss of Dornburg a lavish residence for the duke His passion for the hunt was likewise extravagant when he died Ernst August left 1100 dogs and 373 horses The duke maintained a standing harem in which two noble Ladies of Honour Ehrenfrulein and three Chamber Women Kammerfrauen of low birth attended to his desires

In Nienburg on 24 January 1716 Ernst August married Eleonore Wilhelmine of AnhaltKthen daughter of Emmanuel Lebrecht Prince of AnhaltKthen They had eight children

After the death of his first wife in 1726 the duke decided to not marry again choosing to live quietly with his Ladies of Honor and Chamber Women But in 1732 the situation changed unexpectedly his only surviving son the hereditary prince Erbprinz Johann Wilhelm died This made it necessary for him to find a new wife and sire sons in order to perpetuate the dynasty

In Bayreuth on 7 April 1734 Ernst August married his second wife Sophie Charlotte of BrandenburgBayreuth daughter of George Frederick Charles Margrave of BrandenburgBayreuth They had four children

The duke also had an illegitimate son with Friederike von Marschall

In 1741 the branch of SaxeEisenachJena became extinct with the death of Wilhelm Heinrich Duke of SaxeEisenach As the only surviving kinsman of the late duke Ernst August inherited his estates the union between SaxeWeimar and SaxeEisenachJena now became permanent One of the dukes few wise decisions was the institution of the Primogenitur in SaxeWeimar confirmed in 1724 by the Emperor Karl VI this stopped further land divisions in the future From 1741 his new duchy took the name of SaxeWeimarEisenach Jena was merged by Eisenach but the union was by this time only personal The new state consisted of two larger areas around the two official residences in Weimar and Eisenach which were not connected and a patch of smaller areas and towns between them

The annexation of SaxeEisenach was favorable to the huntloving duke he possessed a large swath of woods in the Eisenach region which seemed suitable to him for hunting He left the Hereditary Prince in Weimar in the Schloss Belvedere under the guardianship of his Hofmarschall and moved permanently to Eisenach After this the duke rarely asked for his son and send the most unreasonable written instructions from Eisenach to Weimar in order to supervise his sons education The Hereditary Prince saw his father for the last time in 1743

Ernst August tried to implement Absolutism in SaxeWeimar on the French model The secret Ratskollegium a consultative organ national formed by nobles was dissolved In 1746 the citizens of Eisenach presented the duke a memorandum detailing national prerogatives in which he was denounced for constant offences against traditional rights The gesture demonstrated that the citizens of the duchy were resisting the introduction of absolutism thus certain policies that Ernst August had planned could not be completely carried out The dukes death prevented a terrible controversy between the national nobles and the citizens of Eisenach

Upon his death Ernst August left a financially ruined duchy and a successor to the throne Ernst August II who was still under age

The Physics of Star Trek
The Physics of Star Trek is a 1995 nonfiction book by the theoretical physicist Lawrence M Krauss It is the third book by Krauss who later wrote a followup titled Beyond Star Trek in 1997

Krauss discusses the physics involved in various concepts and objects described in the Star Trek universe He investigates the possibility of such things as inertial dampers and warp drive and whether physics as we know it would allow such inventions He also discusses time travel light speed pure energy beings wormholes teleportation and other concepts that are staples of the Star Trek universe The book includes a foreword by astrophysicist Stephen Hawking

The Physics of Star Trek was met with generally positive reviews It became a national bestseller and sold more than 200000 copies in the United States As of 1998 it was being translated into 13 different languages It was also the basis of a BBC television production

Krauss got the idea for writing the book from his publisher who initially suggested it as a joke Krauss dismissed the idea but later thought that using Star Trek might get people interested in real physics

The hardcover edition was published in November 1995 and a paperback edition followed in September 1996 The book was revised and updated by Krauss in 2007 Krausss next book Beyond Star Trek Physics from Alien Invasions to the End of Time was published in 1997

Epic of evolution
In social cultural and religious studies the epic of evolution is a narrative that blends religious and scientific views of cosmic biological and sociocultural evolution in a mythological manner According to Taylors Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature an epic of evolution encompasses
Epic of evolution seems to have originated from the sociobiologist Edward O Wilsons use of the phrase evolutionary epic in 1978 Wilson was not the first to use the term but his prominence prompted its usage as the morphed phrase epic of evolution In later years he also used the latter term

Naturalistic and liberal religious writers have picked up on Wilsons term and have used it in a number of texts These authors however have at times used other terms to refer to the idea Universe Story Brian Swimme John F Haught Great Story Connie Barlow Michael Dowd Everybodys Story Loyal Rue New Story Thomas Berry Al Gore Brian Swimme and Cosmic Evolution Eric Chaisson

Evolution generally refers to biological evolution but here it means a process in which the whole universe is a progression of interrelated phenomena a gradual process in which something changes into a different and usually more complex form emergence It should not be biologized as it includes many areas of science In addition outside of the scientific community the term evolution is frequently used differently from scientists usage Even respected dictionaries may present questionable definitions that are not scientific or only address genetic changes Unfortunately it is common for the general public to enter into a discussion about evolution with a wrong definition in mind This often leads to misunderstanding since scientists are viewing evolution from a different perspective The same applies to the use of the term theory as used in the theory of evolution see references for Evolution as theory and fact

This epic is not a long narrative poem but a series of events that form the proper subject for a laudable kind of tale It is mythic in that it is a story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the worldview of a people and explains a natural phenomenon It is a form of myth that has an approach to investigation that is empirical or scientific According to Joseph Campbell myths serve two purposesprovide meaning for a maturing individual an individuate and how to be part of a community This Epic does both

Dr William Grassie of Temple University writes that the word myth in common usage is usually misunderstood In academia it defines a story that serves to define the fundamental world view of a culture by explaining aspects of the natural world and delineating the psychological and social practices and ideals of a society He suggests that the Greek term mythos would be a better term to apply to the Epic as it is more allencompassing He concluded that there is not yet an interpretive tradition within science and society about this epic of evolution If anything there is an antiinterpretation tradition Consequently this is dangerous as it is a powerful revelation at this time Grassie says the Epic is complex and multifaceted not simple or easy to understand It takes a romantic vision philosophical rigor and artistic interpretations It requires a consilience of modern disciplines and acceptance of social diversity The ancient wisdoms of the worlds spiritual traditions must be adapted to make the framework to weave the Epic

E O Wilson explained that humans had a need for the epic of evolution because they must have a mythical story or a sublime account of how the world was created and how humanity became part of it Religious epics fulfill a primal need in this respect as they verify that humans are part of something greater than themselves The best empirical knowledge that science and history can provide is necessary in order to provide a comparable epic tale that will reliably unite a separated human spirituality He believes the evolutionary epic can be as inherently noble as any religious epic when it is expressed in a poetic way In a similar vein biologist Ursula Goodenough sees the tale of natural emergence as far more magical than traditional religious miracles It is a story that people can work with in a religious way if they elect to do so

Philip Hefner uses the analogy of weaving to describe the Epic The warp anchors the story and the weft creates the pattern and the tapestry The Epic as scientists see it is the warp and the weft forms the pattern as each of us views it we are all weavers but the patterns all have the warp in common Hefner writes that stories about the evolutionary epic are redolent with ultimacy It is not science it is scientifically informed myth a myth driven by the refusal to give up on the insistence that the natural world and our lives in the world have meaning and purpose It is a mythical tale of irony and hope that fills a large space in the domain of religionandscience Biologist Ursula Goodenough also makes use of Hefners weaving metaphor

Connie Barlow and Michael Dowds Great Story divides the epic into 8 phases eons or eras the Great Radiance the Galactic Hadean Archean Proterozoic Paleozoic Mesozoic and Cenozoic Dowd uses the term epic of evolution to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology a form of theistic evolution His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive He preaches that the epic of cosmic biological and human evolution revealed by science is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe Evolution is viewed as a spiritual process that it is not meaningless blind chance

Loyal Rue states that there is nothing in the core of everybodys story to rule out belief in a personal deity However belief in God is not an indispensable part of this narrative and here will be both theistic and nontheistic versions of it He says it is the fundamental story of matter created from energy the organization of that matter into complex conditions and then via selforganization into diverse life forms Humans are as other living thingswe are by nature starborn earthformed fitnessmaximized biochemical systems An aspect of the Epic is the evolution of behavior by that biochemical system

Brian Swimme sees the Epic as a way to gently maneuver a person into the magnificence of the Universe and as an antidote to the unhealthy consciousness of consumerism It is the way into the future and enabled him to comprehend the cultural significance of this new story of science moving away from a materialistic worldview It may move science away from its traditional abstractness to the uniqueness found in natural history To him evolution and creativity are equivalent so it could be the Epic of Creativity similar to Gordon Kaufmans thinking Although the Epic is scientific it is definitely mythicit has the fundamental nature of being mythic You take hydrogen gas and you leave it alone and it turns into rosebuds giraffes and humans

Gordon D Kaufman sees the Epic as a serendipitous creative process He states that it is a notion that can interpret the enormous expansion and complexification of the physical universe from the Big Bang outward as well as the evolution of life here on earth and the gradual emergence of human historical existence The whole vast process manifests in varying degrees serendipitous creativity an everflowing coming into being of new modes of reality In his book In the beginningcreativity he says this creative process is God Creativity as metaphor and as defined in the concept of evolution has possibilities for constructing a new concept of God The most foundational kind of creativity is found in that of cosmosbiological evolutiona paradigm that is now the organizing principle of all the sciences It would seem as though he was equating God to the evolutionary story This is similar to Dowd who sees the facts of Nature as Gods native tongue

Eric Chaisson orients his view of the epic around an arrow of time which he divides into Seven Ages of the Cosmos particulate galactic stellar planetary chemical biological and cultural However such a thermodynamic arrow is not intended to be directional a common misunderstanding he sees no purpose plan or design in evolution which he regards as unceasing uncaring and unpredictable Chaissons strictly scientific analysis of evolution in its broadest sensecosmic evolutionimplies an unidirectional meandering process extending from the big bang to humankind on Earth and continuing while likely producing increasing complexity perhaps forever to ends unknown As a physicist he is perhaps best known for attempting to quantify the epic of evolution using the currently known laws of science and the scientific method with its insistence on experimental tests of all ideas principally those of energy rate density in order to empirically discriminate between objective sense and subjective nonsense What emerges is a grand and inspiring scientific narrative of who we are and whence we camethe most recent and uptodate version of this work having been summarized in a long peerreview article

Bron Taylors Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature gives four primary categories cosmic planetary life cultural

The creationevolution controversy goes beyond the field of evolutionary biology and includes many fields of science cosmology geology paleontology thermodynamics physics and sociobiology

Although in the scientific community there is essentially universal agreement that the evidence of evolution is overwhelming and the consensus supporting the neoDarwinian evolutionary synthesis is nearly absolute creationists have asserted that there is a significant scientific controversy and disagreement over the validity of the evolution epic

The debate is sometimes portrayed as being between science and religion However as the National Academy of Sciences states

DrJohn Haught Roman Catholic theologian in his Science and Religion from Conflict to Conversation suggests a theistic acceptance of the Epic He says contemporary theology is being changed by evolutionary science There are many versions undergoing constant revision He considers evolution to be at least provisionally a most appropriate and fruitful scientific framework within which to think about God today and deplores that contemporary theology gets hung up in the creationism controversy There are liberal congregations these days that may see the epic of evolution as a history about life and the universe that is both scientific and sacred The profoundly sacred elements of the story warm up the cold technical facts with awe and reverence giving Nature an inspiring beauty

Eric Chaisson in his book Epic of Evolution concludes that the coherent story of cosmic evolutiona powerful and noble effortmay perhaps be the way to ethical evolution in the new millennium Although his is a decidedly materialistic view of the evolutionary epic he recognizes more than most scientists that humanity is part of this grand story and that we have a responsibility to survive as the only sentient intelligent beings known in the universe

Not all of the Epics advocates are distinguished scientists Some are Christians who consider it a narrative of mythic proportions that contain religious aspects They see it as a multifaceted concept that has been in Christian theology implicitly for hundreds of years and is congenial to perspectives that include ultimacy transcendence purpose and morality However there are both humanists and creationists who dispute this stance making unclear the many varied theological stories of our world

In 1996 the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science held a conference on the epic of evolution In 1997 the American Association for the Advancement of Science organized a conference on the epic of evolution as part of their program on Dialogue on Science Ethics and Religion In July 1999 The Forum on Religion and Ecology with special support from the Center for Respect of Life and Environment sponsored a conference titled The Epic of Evolution and World Religions It consisted of a small invitational gathering of scholars of the worlds religious traditions as well as a number of scientists and educators It explored how the creation stories of the worlds religions intersect with or react to the epic of evolution An Evolutionary Epic conference was held in Hawaii in January 2008 It was attended by scientists artists educators and spiritual and religious leaders 

Washington University in St Louis offers a course on the epic of evolution The Epic has also been taught at Northern Arizona University The course engaged the task of formulating a new epic myth that is based on the physical natural social and cultural sciences for which there are as yet few textbooks The course was presented in three segments the cosmos before humans appeared the human phenomenon and scenarios for the future of evolution An annual undergraduate course on cosmic evolution has been taught at Harvard University for most of the past 35 years

Evolution Sunday a Christian church event 1044 Congregations observed it in 2009 arose from the Clergy Letter Project signed in 2004 by 10500 American clergy It is spreading internationally and across other faiths It supports the story of evolution in a manner similar to the Epic science and religion compatibility promoting serious discussion and reflection on the relationship between religion and science For far too long strident voices in the name of Christianity have been claiming that people must choose between religion and modern science says Michael Zimmerman founder of Evolution Sunday and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Butler University in Indianapolis Were saying you can have your faith and you can also have science

Michael Dowd and his wife Connie Barlow have traveled the US since 2002 by van as nomads teaching his Gospel of Evolution

Lincoln Village was built in the late 1950s as part of a new neighborhood concept in which suburbs were built near factories and would include local schools and strip malls of stores which would support the families It was written up in a major article in Life Magazine about 1960 as the wave of the future Lincoln Village was built near the Columbus factories for Westinghouse and General Motors The model homes for Lincoln Village were the first few homes on the west side of Redmond Road The development is newer than the homes on roads to its west from Woodlawn Avenue to New Rome and from South Grener Avenue to I270 Another highlight of the neighborhood was the wellknown Lincoln Lodge Motel which included a golf course which was at the northwest corner of North Murray Hill Road and West Broad Street

The general area is home to several older buildings and contains apartment complexes and stores Popular stores in or near the neighborhood are KFC CVS and the Home Depot Lincoln Village South is home to Stiles Elementary School Stiles is home to children from Lincoln Park Murray Hill and Cherry Creek The school has been criticized recently because it was found that during the 20052006 school year 31 of the children at Stiles could not speak English Stiles is 26 Hispanic 25 AfricanAmerican 44 White and 5 mixed races This is a huge change from the all white WASP neighborhood it was in the 1960s Stiles has played a large role in the history and story of the neighborhood

Susanna of Fontanarossa 14351489 was the mother of navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus
Sussana was born in the hillside village of Monticellu on the then Genoese island of Corsica to a wealthy Catholic family Her family owned substantial real estate in Quezzi a little village in the lowlying valley of Bisagno part of the presentday city of Genoa She married Domenico Colombo in 1445 and bore him 5 children Cristoforo Bartolomeo Giovanni Giacomo and a daughter named Bianchinetta

A notarised document of sale in the Genoa state archive contains the Latinate text Sozana quondam de Jacobi de Fontana Rubea uxor Dominici de Columbo de Ianua ac Christophorus et Pelegrinus filii eorum which can be translated as Susanna was the daughter of Giacomo from Fontanarossa of the Bisagno wife of Domenico Columbus from Genoa their sons are Cristoforo and Pellegrino The was a significant inland district in the ancient Republic of Genoa including the valley of the Bisagno Thus she was described as Susanna from Fontanarossa within the Val Bisagno rather than Suzanna Fontarossa

Today the hilltop village of Fontanarossa Goretto Genova Liguria in the Val Trebbia 31km inland from Genoa at  and only 6km beyond the watershed of the river Bisagno has a marble stone with the inscription Susanna Fontanarossa the mother of Christopher Columbus was born in this village In questo borgo nacque Susanna Fontanarossa madre di Cristoforo Colombo

<doc id="7731402" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731402" title="Third Order of Saint Dominic">
Third Order of Saint Dominic
The Third Order of Saint Dominic properly referred to as the Lay Fraternities of St Dominic or Lay Dominicans since 1972 is a Roman Catholic third order affiliated with the Dominican Order

Lay Dominicans are men and women singles and couples living a Christian life with a Dominican spirituality in the secular world They find inspiration following the same spiritual path taken by many saints blesseds and other holy men and women throughout the 800year history of the Dominican Order The Life of a Dominican layperson is all about having a passion for the Word of God It is about committing one self to a community of like minded brothers and sisters that immerse themselves in the Word of God There are Lay Dominican Provinces all around the world

This was one of the earliest developments of the ancient Ordo de Poenitentia Order of Penance This was a status which developed in the ancient Church in which those faithful who sought a more dedicated way of life embraced the lifestyle of a penitent then in effect in the Church It was not the organization from which the Friars Preachers evolved but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under Dominican influence At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form its members gradually grew more and more dependent on their spiritual guides

Friar Munio of Zamora the seventh Master General of the Friars Preachers formulated a definite Rule for these lay penitents in 1285 By this the Ordo de Poenitentia was to be ruled in each local center by a Dominican priest and was to be subject to the obedience of the Dominican priors provincial and Masters General Henceforward this branch was linked to the fortunes of the Friars Preachers and wore their habits of black and white with few minor differences varying according to time and country They were not specifically called a third order until after papal recognition in 1405 but continued to be known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St Dominic

A military order called the Militia Jesu Christi soldiery of Jesus Christ also became a part of the third order It owed its origin to Bishop Foulques of Toulouse Simon de Montfort and probably to St Dominic then a canon regular This connection with the founder of the Friars Preachers is first discussed in documents relating to the Blessed Raymund of Capua who became a Dominican about 1350 As early as 1235 Pope Gregory IX confided the Militia to the care of Friar Jordan of Saxony second Master General by a Bull of 18 May and in the same year he decreed a habit of black and white for the knights Further when the Militia was brought across the Alps and established in Italy it is found to be always connected with some Dominican church Lastly it was very largely influenced by a famous Dominican Friar Bartolomeo of Braganza or of Vicenza as he is sometimes called

Originally working side by side and independent of each other because both received the same spiritual administration of the Friars Preachers they appear to have been merged at the close of the 13th century So too their ultimate merging is hinted at by Honorius III in 1221 when he designates the Militia nomine poenitentiae and a comparison also of the rules of the two institutions that of Pope Gregory for the Militia in 1235 and that of Munio de Zamora for the Order of Penance of St Dominic in 1285 would lead one to the same conclusion The only considerable difference that could be cited against this identify is that Munio of Zamora expressly forbids the carrying of arms But this is in reality but a further proof of their approximation for he allows for the one exception which could possibly apply to the Militia viz in defence of the Church This amalgamation is admitted by the Bollandists to have become general in the 14th century

From this double movement therefore ie from the Ordo de Poenitentia S Dominici and the Militia Jesu Christi was born the modern Third Order of St Dominic Though its source is therefore anterior to the First Order its full perfection as an organized society with a distinctive habit a definite rule and a declared ethos or spirit is due to the genius of the children of St Dominic They took an ancient institution and with their characteristic love of order and systematic arrangement brought it into something compact and symmetrical From them this idea of subjection to a First Order was taken up by the Franciscans and has been adopted by all subsequent Third Orders

The work of the Third Order is to engage laypeople to help in reform of church discipline Its initial purpose was the preaching of penance but under Dominican influences it leaned to the intellectual aspect of the Faith and based its message to the world on the exposition of the Creed it was to reform Church discipline by the more widespread knowledge of the mysteries of faith It also helped to defend the Church and to develop the communion of prayer The medieval ideal of Christs Mystical Body which has captivated all spiritualminded people implies a harmony of prayer To achieve this end the contemplative and monastic orders were begun and the Third Order of St Dominic endeavours to link pious souls to this great throng of religious Proctor The Dominican Tertiarys Daily Manual London 1900 1520

Only for one period in its history was there any real fear of suppression Many held that the condemnation passed on the Beguines and Beghards at the Council of Vienna in 1312 applied no less to the Orders of Penance In consequence the mastergeneral petitioned Pope John XXII in 1326 to settle definitely the difficulty As a result he answered by a Bull of 1 June 1326 Cum de Mulieribus which is a long eulogium on the work of the Dominican Third Order

After the plague of 1348 a great deal of laxity and disorganization crept into the Third Order but a wonderful throng of saints soon caused its rejuvenation The influence of St Catherine of Siena gave a powerful impetus to the movement in Italy and her work was carried on by Bl Clara Gambacorta died 1419 and Bl Maria Mancini died 1431 This new spiritual vigour reached across the Alps to the sisterhoods of Germany where the effect was almost abnormal Heimbucher Die Orden und Kongregationen der katholischen Kirche Paderborn 1907 II 169177 But there has never been any reform in the sense of a separate organization with a change of rule or habit As in the First Order there has been a peculiar gift of unity which has enabled it to last undivided for seven hundred years

The Third Order as it exists today can be divided into two categories regular ie comprising Tertiaries whether men or women who live in community and wear the habit externally and secular ie whether married or single cleric or lay who live their lives like others of their profession but who privately take up practices of austerity recite some liturgical Office and wear some symbol of the Dominican habit

The origin of the conventual women Tertiaries has never been very clearly worked out It is usual to trace them back to Emily Bicchieri about the year 1255 But if the view taken above of the origin of the Third Order in the Ordo de Poenitentia be correct we are forced to the conclusion that the communities of women established by St Dominic at Prouille S Sisto etc were really of this Third Order Their constitutions approved first for S Sisto though previously observed at Prouille expressly speak of the nuns as de Poenitentia S Mariae Magdalenae It would seem then that the Ordo de Poenitentia did not exclude convents of enclosed nuns from its ranks and this was due probably to St Dominic himself

Very much later came a conventual order of men originated by the genius of Pre Lacordaire He considered that the democratic spirit of the Dominican Order fitted it especially for the task of training the youth But he knew how impossible it was for his preaching associates to tie themselves down to schoolwork among boys as a consequence he began in 1852 a Third Order of men wearing the habit living in community yet without the burdens of monastic life The rule was approved provisionally in 1853 and definitely in 1868

But by far the greatest portion of the Third Order consists of secular Tertiaries These are of every rank of society and represent the old Ordo de Poenitentia and the old Militia In certain countries they are grouped into chapters having a lay prior and subprior or prioress and subprioress and hold monthly meetings Since the Rule of Muon de Zamora 1285 they have always been subject to a Dominican priest appointed by the Dominican provincial For the actual reception of the habit the mastergeneral can give faculties to any priest The full habit is the same as that of the members of the First and Second Orders but without the scapular granted however to communities since 1667 Though the habit is not worn during life many procure it so that they may be buried in the recognized dress of St Dominics children

It is practically impossible to obtain even in a vague way the number of the secular Dominican Tertiaries No general register is kept and the records of each priory would have to be searched From the time of St Louis  who wished to join the Dominican and Franciscan Orders Acta Sanctorum August V 545 and is represented in old illuminations sometimes in the habit of one sometimes in the habit of the other Chapotin Histoire de dominicains de la province de France Rouen 1898 p497 but probably never joined either to our own time it can be stated only that with the rise and fall of the First Orders greatness rose and fell the number of the Tertiaries In England during the 13th century very many are said to have become Tertiaries But of this nothing for certain can be specified

At the time of St Catherine of Siena the Mantellate women secular Tertiaries made difficulties about receiving her to the habit as they included at the date only widows Gardner St Catherine of Siena London 1907 II and there were no men at all in the Third Order in Italy at that date Acta Sanctorum April III 1881 Under Bl Raymond of Capua her confessor and after her death twentythird master general attempts were made to reestablish the order and no doubt much was done Mortier Matres gnraux III 605606 But by the time of St Antoninus died 1450 the numbers had again dwindled down to insignificance Summa Moralis Verona 1750 III 23 5 5 pp12912 Just previous to the Reformation there are a few isolated notices thus Bl Adrian Fortescue the martyr notes in his diary Given to the Black Friars of Oxford to be in their fraternity 12d Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII London 1883 Rolls Series VII 101 But these give us no ground at all for any surmise as to statistics In the Americas the first canonized saint St Rose of Lima died 1617 and the first beatified person of mixedrace St Martin de Porres died 1639 were both Dominican Tertiaries and later in France were men like M Olier and St Louis de Montfort

In the United States Lay Dominican Provinces include the Southern Province Central Province Western Province and Eastern Province

Then came the influence of Lacordaire from whose time there dates a new enthusiasm in the Third Order Anne Dominicaine Paris 1910 14965 Of the regular Tertiaries it is easier to speak more definitely The numbers of all the sixteen approved congregations existing in 1902 are given and they amount to some 7000 nuns Analecta Ord Praed Rome 1902 389 To these must be added another 7000 of congregations not yet definitively authorized by Rome But many fresh convents were opened and the numbers continually increased In England they began under Mother Margaret Hallahan died 1868 in 1842 and now in all the separate groupings there are 22 convents with some 500 sisters in the United States their success has been remarkable Founded in 1846 by Mother Amalie Barth died 1895 the congregation in 1902 included 34 convents and over 2000 nuns In 1876 they passed into California where they are rapidly increasing In Ireland they have many establishments especially for educational purposes for their work is as varied as the needs of humanity require Some are enclosed others teach visit the sick nurse the lepers look after old people take care of penitent girls work among the poor in the slums etc As for the congregation of teaching men they have been greatly disorganized since their expulsion from France At present they comprise but a halfdozen colleges in Fribourg San Sebastian and South America and do not amount to more than 100 members in all Finally a citation from Fabers Blessed Sacrament 2nd ed p565 may be made Those who are conversant with indeed who find the strength and consolation of their lives in the Acts of the Saints well know that there is not a nook in the mystical Paradise of our heavenly spouse where the flowers grow thicker or smell more fragrantly than this order of multitudinous childlike saints Nowhere in the Church does the Incarnate Word show His delight at being with the children of men in more touching simplicity with more unearthly sweetness or more spouselike familiarity than in this the youngest family of S Dominic

Clea novel
Clea published in 1960 is the fourth volume in The Alexandria Quartet series by British author Lawrence Durrell Set in Alexandria Egypt around World War II the first three volumes tell the same story from different points of view and Clea relates subsequent events

Durrell wrote the book in four weeks

The book begins with the Narrator Darley living on a remote Greek island with Nessims illegitimate daughter from Melissa The child is now six years old  marking the time that has elapsed since the events of Justine Darley has been able to spend this period on the islandthinking writing maturingdue to the 500 left him in his will by the writer Pursewarden who killed himself

Mnemjian arrives unexpectedly to see Darley with a message from Nessim and news of events in Alexandrianotably the fall from prosperity of the Hosnani family Nessim his wife Justine and brother Narouzthe latter dead Mnemjian is a prosperous barber and possibly brothel owner

They proceed to Alexandria now under nightly bombardment because of the War WW2 Darley continues to reminisce sometimes lamenting and seeks and sometimes finds the characters of the earlier book

He runs into Clea in the street  and they effortlessly pick up an affaire de coeur  this time unencumbered by the interfering physical presences of Justine and Melissa

In The New York Times Orville Prescott noted that the novel contained fine passages of lushly beautiful descriptive writing and one marvelously grotesque and horrible disaster and was more passive reflective and meandering than its predecessors in the Quartet Prescott also observed that the lengthy digression on the philosophy of literature purportedly taken from Pursewardens notebooks makes astonishingly little sense Kirkus Reviews lauded Durrells prose as rich with implication color evocation humor wit and poetry with characters  as vivid as dreams

Joan Ambrosio Dalza
Joan Ambrosio Dalza fl 1508 was an Italian lutenist and composer Nothing is known about his life His surviving works comprise the fourth volume of Ottaviano Petruccis influential series of lute music publications Intabolatura de lauto libro quarto Venice 1508 Dalza is referred to as milanese in the preface so it must be assumed he was either born in Milan or worked there or both

Together with the oeuvres of Francesco Spinacino and Vincenzo Capirola Dalzas work constitutes an important part of early Renaissance lute music The surviving pieces comprise 42 dances nine ricercares five tastar de corde four intabulations and a piece called Caldibi castigliano The dances are arranged in miniature suites Each of the five pavanes five alla venetiana four alla ferrarese is followed by a saltarello and a piva that are thematically and harmonically related to it Other groupings include pairs of tastar de corde with a recercar dietro Some pieces such as Caldibi castigliano and those titled Calate ala spagnola show Spanish influence possibly because of vihuela cultivation in 16th century Italy

Dalzas music is for the most part comparatively simple and easy to perform The composer himself acknowledged the fact in the preface to Petruccis volume and promised to publish more complex pieces at a later date It is currently unknown whether this had been realized Although contemporaries such as Spinacino and Capirola wrote in a more advanced idiom Dalzas output is important because it consists almost entirely of original music not vocal intabulations Furthermore Dalzas collection includes the earliest known pavanes described as padoane diverse on the title page which are also the earliest known variations all pavane alla venetiana feature harmonic variations with a loosely defined tonic and pavane alla ferrarese consist of series of openended phrases followed by varied repeats AABBCC etc These variation forms are sometimes referred to as singlestrain and multiplestrain respectively

Dalzas collection is also one of the very few sources to feature tastar de corde short introductory preludes The name translates from Italian to testing of the strings Dalzas pieces are arranged symmetrically by key G C D with F C with E G They range from 16 number 1 to 42 bars numbers 3 and 4 the material essentially consists of static chords alternating with short fast passages

A nurse by training Evans was first elected to the legislature in 1997 representing the riding of Sherwood Park for the Progressive Conservatives She previously held the portfolios of Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister of Childrens Services Prior to being elected to the legislature Evans served as a school board trustee municipal councillor and finally as the reeve of Strathcona County

Evans sparked a controversy when speaking to the Economic Club of Canada in Toronto on June 17 2009 when she answered a question by stating that good parenting means sacrificing income to stay at home while children are young and that her own children now grown with young children of their own understood perfectly well that when youre raising children you dont both go off to work and leave them for somebody else to raise

In response to accusations that she had insulted working women she later stated that she had not meant to harm anybody or slam anybodys views on how they chose to parent or what choices theyve made on the involvement in their families and parenting suggesting that this demonstrated societys concern over parenting and So maybe its time for this debate  maybe frequently we should examine what our choices are as families and see whether our choices are the ones that are working best for the child

Naomi Striemer
Naomi Striemer born October 6 1982 is a CanadianAmerican singer Raised in a conservative Christian home she sang from the time she was a young child Following early success with secular she has turned her attention to Christian songwriting and singing

She was raised on a hobby farm in Malagash Point near Truro Nova Scotia and homeschooled by strict missionary parents At age ten her family moved to Manitoba where in 1993 the 11yearold recorded an album of Christian music Before that point she had never watched television nor listened to the radio In 1998 her family moved again this time to Florida

In an article in Billboard that ran in February 2007 Striemer told writer Chuck Taylor that her parents were artistic people hippies going the opposite way to vegetarian farmland They did a total 360 I was completely unaware of their previous world and a trusting child who wasnt particularly curious We would play tapes in the car either classical music or folk bible songs and sermons that was the only world I knew

In a November 21 2006 interview on CBC Radios Sounds Like Canada Striemer revealed that she is very protective of her voice Her diet excludes caffeine fizzy drinks and very hot  cold items Concerning her childhood she reflected on the close ties she had with nature and animals on the farm While still 5 or 6 she sang with adults in a group She further stated that she basically knew from an early age she wanted to sing professionally

In April 2001 Striemer was signed by Epic Records and completed her first album for them in 2003 which was never released following a shakeup at Epics parent Sony BMG The following year she and her family moved to the rural community of Delhi Ontario Conflicted over Epics shelving of her album she nonetheless continued performing in the Toronto area where she met her next manager following a performance at an Indigo Bookstore Steven Nowack subsequently founded S Records to launch Striemers career and she was the first artist signed to S Records

Striemer moved to Los Angeles in 2005 S Records solicited the participation of producer Narada Michael Walden who has the most number one hits of any producer in history responsible for writing and producing many of the signature hit songs for Aretha Franklin Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey

Following a chance meeting with Carlos Santana at a Marin County California steakhouse Santana recorded on Striemers first cd Images on the first single titled Cars Images was released on December 19 2006 in Canada on the S Records label and was the No 1 downloaded album in Canada Cars was released as a single and in his review Billboards Taylor described it as the years most promising melodic debut A standing ovation of an endorsement Remember the first time you heard Whitney Mariah or Celine and recognized a star was born

Prominent press about Striemer in addition to the CBC interview includes the lead story on the CTV National News the most watched and most prominent nightly newscast in Canada a front page and a feature story in Canadas national newspaper National Post features on the CTV national news and Entertainment Tonight a lifestyle front in Canadas Globe and Mail and multiple items in Roger Friedmans Foxnewscom Foxlife column

In December 2006 S Records offered Cars as a free download on Internet site sympaticomsnca The move thrust Images to become the No 1 downloaded album in Canada for the final two weeks of the year topping discs by Sarah McLachlan U2 and the Beatles She repeated the achievement the week of January 15 2007after the free download had expiredbeating fare from Justin Timberlake Josh Groban and Gwen Stefani

In a subsequent profile in Billboard producer Narada Michael Walden told Taylor Steven Nowack is very zealous so I listened to what he had to say not taking his pitch overly seriously until I met Naomi and heard her live I was impressed with her beauty but more so by her voice You believe her She has the chops the range the driveand the humilityto offer a beautiful gift

Taylors description of Striemers Images the album include the haunting pianodriven title track which opens with the lyric I found out today my love has found anotherAnd all the things I did to make you happy wont make you happy anymore as Striemer pleads amid urgent percussion If I could fight my way back to youIt would only throw me further away

Fall Behind is Striemers intense take on her lost contract at Epic She sings Whats happeningI feel the world slipping apart before my eyes amid an inflamed backdrop of electric guitars and howling vocal of defiance

19992002 FARCGovernment peace process
The FARCGovernment peace process 19992002  from January 7 1999 to February 20 2002 was a failed peace process between the Government of President Andrs Pastrana Arango and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC guerrilla group in an effort to bring to an end the ongoing Colombian armed conflict

The FARC began their rebel activities in the early 1960s during the National Front years in which bipartisan hegemony controlled and held political power In an effort to exterminate the armed guerrilla movements the Colombian government aided by the United States launched an attack to destroy the Marquetalia Republic a guerrilla enclave in central Colombia After this attack the FARC guerrilla retreated to isolated or poor government presence areas and began establishing a parallel state governed by them The guerrillas began extorting and kidnapping landowners and assaulting local agrarian banks Caja Agrarias

During the 1980s and 1990s the Colombian drug cartels had increased their power and in some cases had hired the guerrillas such as the FARC and ELN guerrillas to protect illicit cultivations from the government forces The most powerful of the cartels the Medelln and Cali Cartels had engulfed in a war with the government The Medelln Cartel led by Pablo Escobar also became an enemy later of the FARC in a struggle to control the profitable illegal drug trafficking business Escobar helped create right wing paramilitary groups The FARC guerrilla used the revenues from taxing drug lords and cultivation and production of these to finance their rebel activities

On August 18 1989 the Medelln Cartel assassinated the liberal presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galn Csar Gaviria replaced him and was then elected president of Colombia Gaviria avenged the death of Galan by dismantling the Medelln Cartel but the gap left by this organization was quickly filled by the Cali Cartel and the FARC which began expanding its influence and armed power in the countryside mainly

During the government of Ernesto Samper the opposing candidate Andrs Pastrana accused President Samper of financing its campaign with money from the Cali Cartel The political scandal known as the 8000 Process surged and weakened the presidency and government institutions The United States also conditioned its support for the government focusing mainly on aiding the military forces on operations against narcotics that would ultimately help bring down the Cali Cartel

Without any major adversaries in the drug business other than the growing AUC paramilitary group the FARC gained control of most the drug production and trade as well as financing its political rhetoric and influence over most of the regions in Colombia With the weakening of the drug cartels the guerrillas became the main issue affecting Colombia Andrs Pastrana ran for the presidential office again and as a candidate his campaign sustained negotiations with the FARC for a possible peace process

Pastrana then appointed Victor G Ricardo as High Commissioner for Peace and held conversations with Manuel Marulanda Velez aka Tirofijo top commander of the FARC on June 15 1998 On July 9 elected president Pastrana travelled to the mountains of Colombia and personally met with rebel commanders including Tirofijo himself

On October 8 both sides agreed to create a demilitarized zone in the region of El Caguan a jungle region in south central Colombia made up by the municipalities of Vista Hermosa La Macarena La Uribe and Mesetas in Meta Department and San Vicente del Cagun in Caquet Department

On August 7 1998 Pastrana becomes president of Colombia for the period 19982002

On December 14 1998 the Pastrana administration and the FARC agreed to begin formal peace talks on January 7 1999

The FARC demanded and proposed certain issues in order to begin the following were proposed to quell the armed conflict vision of the conflict negotiation criteria preparation of the negotiation political legitimacy security participation negotiated political settlement civilian population recommendations to the civilian population and rules of behavior regarding the masses The group also considered fundamental topics democracy functioning of the state the public force social and economic aspects agrarian reform natural resources sovereignty drug trafficking paramilitarism and CONVIVIR security groups

On the other hand the government tried to persuade the FARC to leave the Colombian Army Cazadores Battalion stationed in the area of El Caguan but FARC opposed Victor G Ricardo agreed to withdraw the Battalion without consulting military officials The government urged the FARC to support projects to manually eradicate illegal crops

As planned the formal dialogues began on January 7 1999 in a ceremony at El Caguan with the presence of President Pastrana but without the presence of Tirofijo The FARC argued that there was a possible threat to assassinate their commander Tirofijo FARC negotiator Joaqun Gmez acted on behalf of Tirofijo President Pastrana said that the absence of Manuel Marulanda Velez cannot be a reason to not continue with the instalment of the dialogue to agree on an agenda that will conduct us to peace On January 8 Tirofijo showed up and insisted that there had been a possible assassination attempt

On January 11 guerrilla commander Jorge Briceo threatened to kidnap highprofile people if the government did not comply with FARCs demands for a prisoner exchange Some years before the FARC had kidnapped a considerable number of military personnel highprofile politicians and government officials Pastrana replied with a threat to end the peace process if the FARC carried out the kidnappings On January 19 the FARC froze the dialogues that the AUC paramilitary groups were resurging and demanded the government to act against these groups and its supporters within the government

On February 6 President Pastrana extends the duration of the demilitarized zone and sets it to expire on May 7 Three days later Pastrana and Tirofijo finally met publicly and set a new meeting on February 14 to resume dialogues The FARC had purportedly frozen the peace talks because of the governments spraying of glyphosate to eradicate illegal crops as stated in the Plan Colombia

Between February 25 and March 11 three American indigenousrights activists Terence Freitas Laheenae Gay and Ingrid Washinawatok were abducted by the FARC in Arauca Department and later assassinated The FARC admitted the assassination and apologized The Colombian government then accused a high ranking FARC member known as Germn Briceo brother of Jorge Briceo of the assassination and the United States demanded the FARC to hand over the perpetrators The FARC refused

From April 20 to May 1 both parties met unofficially in El Caguan to discuss the paramilitary issue and the FARCs demands to expand the area of the demilitarized zone which was due to expire on May 7 and to extend the timeframe

On May 2 President Pastrana travelled to the demilitarized zone and personally met with Tirofijo for a second time Pastrana convinced him to begin formal peacetalks on May 6 It was agreed that the demilitarized area would remain in size but its expiration would be postponed Another decision was to form an International Verification Commission to observe the agreements and the FARCs actions in the area

On May 26 Colombian Minister of Defense Rodrigo Lloreda resigned after criticising the presidents handling of the peace process Lloreda opposed the indefinite extension of the timeline of the demilitarized area The High Commissioner for Peaces remarks suggesting an extension of the demilitarized area for the FARC triggered a discontent in some servicemen in the Colombian military 18 generals also tried to resign but the president only accepted Lloredas The head of the armed forces Gen Fernando Tapias offered President Pastrana a public show of support Pastrana then appointed Luis Fernando Ramrez as Defense Minister

The Center for International Policy led a delegation of US Congressmen to Colombia Among the representatives was William Delahunt DMA and six other members of Congress who met with government officials and representatives of political parties church groups peace groups human rights groups US government employees stationed in Colombia and the United Nations On June 4 the delegation of US representatives travelled to El Caguan to meet with rebel leaders They held talks without results with guerrilla commander Ral Reyes regarding the drug trade kidnappings and the assassination of US citizens specially related to the three US indigenous workers

The government then announced that the formal negotiations with the FARC would begin on July 7 But a day before both parties postponed the peace talks until July 19 alleging that three of FARCs negotiators could not arrive on time to the meeting the FARC argued that they also needed more time to organize their positions regarding the International Commission as agreed between Tirofijo and President Pastrana

Between 812 July the FARC launched an armed offensive called by them as armed strikes from the  in which the guerrilla group attacked 15 small towns and targeted infrastructure mainly commercial banks bridges and energy infrastructure random kidnappings Colloquially called in Colombian  as well as assaulting numerous National Police small posts The Military of Colombia with the help of the US government counterattacked by bombing guerrilla enclaves using US provided satellite intelligence

On July 15 1999 Defense Minister Luis Fernando Ramrez and the Colombian General of the Chief of Staff Fernando Tapias requested US500 million as aid to fund counternarcotics and counterinsurgency warfare The then head of the US Office of National Drug Control Policy Barry McCaffrey called for a billion dollar as supplemental assistance for the war on drugs in South America half of it to be assigned to Colombia

South African Sheepdog Association
The South African Sheepdog Association SASDA is an association responsible for organising and controlling sheepdog related activities in South Africa This involves overseeing the competitions sheepdog trials that are held by regional clubs during the year and maintaining the stud book to manage the registration of sheepdogs in South Africa It also works with the regional clubs in an effort to further the spread of interest in sheepdogs as useful working resources in the life of the stock farmer and to encourage handlers to participate in competition Competition is seen as a way to maintain the standard of breeding and training of working sheepdogs

The South African Sheepdog Association was established in 1961 when a group of farmers in the Karoo came together to discuss the future of the sheepdog in South Africa The inaugural meeting with 13 members present was held at Union High School in Graaff Reinet and Mr Bun Kingwill was elected as the first president of the association
During the South African championship of that year Tess of Mr Billy Kingwill became the first South African champion under the watchful eye of the judge Mr Henry Hartzenberg of Graaff Reinet
Since the inauguration of SASDA a South African championship has been held each year
Over time the course has also changed to upgrade the standard and difficulty to improve the dogs working ability In the beginning the course was very much like the ones used in Australia but gradually changed to the English version
The current course with the double lift which has been implemented in 2001 has been taken over virtually as is from the one used for the international championship in the United Kingdom and in so doing putting South African dogs and handlers on the same foot as their overseas counterparts
Through the years the South African Sheepdog Association still strives toward its main objective  to introduce farmers and other interested people to sheepdogs as a labour saving force This is done through demonstrations and courses as well as competitions where breeding success is tested and the best breeding material selected according to working ability
The previous logo appears on the right

The association is made up of a number of regional clubs loosely based on the provinces and regions of South Africa together with a central office responsible for the maintenance of the registration of dogs and breeders

Each club typically holds one trial a year They normally run for two to three days and are usually arranged in such a way as to give each dog at least two opportunities to compete Trials that comply with certain standards including a minimum entry will be able to advertise as Dog of the Year DOY trials Competitors taking part in these trials will be able to accumulate points towards the DOY competition

Once a year a national trial is held It is generally referred to as The Nationals Handlers all compete on the same trial field on an equal footing and after a number of rounds the most successful dog is awarded the title of National Champion At the same event the dog that has accumulated the most points at Dog of the Year trials since the last Nationals competition is awarded the title of South Africa Dog of the Year

During club competition dogs compete in three different categories juniors seniors and top dogs Juniors dont do the more challenging tests of skill like shedding and must win a junior trial to qualify for seniors To qualify for top dogs a dog must win a senior competition and attain a score of at least 90 of the points on offer on the same run The course for top dogs is more of a test It includes narrow drive gates and may include a double lift or some other additional test

Most club trials include a further category beginners Any dog can compete in a beginner competition To qualify for beginner the handler must have never competed in any other trial category This category was introduced to encourage novices to become part of the family of competitors

SASDA have tried to maintain links with similar organisations in other countries Over the years several experienced handlers from England Wales Scotland and the USA have been invited to come and judge important trials most often the Nationals The 2006 Nationals were judged by Dick Roper from England Most international judges invited to travel to judge trials are also invited to run workshops to encourage the sharing of ideas

South African dogs are not allowed to compete in Europe without first completing six months of quarantine but South African dogs have competed in the USA In 2005 Faansie Basson and Wally Ward represented South Africa in the USA At the Meeker Classic Faansie Basson finished 8th in the final with Lad

Handlers have brought dogs from Europe to compete in South Africa in the past To do this before they travel to South Africa they need to arrange to sell the dogs they bring to local handlers after the competition so that they can leave them behind when they leave

Occasionally handlers from neighbouring countries will compete in regional trials although this is more the exception than the rule

Kentmere Pike
Kentmere Pike is a fell in the English Lake District rising between the valleys of Kentmere and Longsleddale It is the highpoint on the ridge between Harter Fell and Shipman Knotts

The western Kentmere slopes fall over the rough ground of Hallow Bank Quarter to Ullstone Gill a tributary of the River Kent Beyond here Smallthwaite Knott an outlier of Harter Fell separates Kentmere Pike from the main valley There is extensive evidence of former quarrying on this flank

By contrast the Longsleddale side wears a rim of crag above the narrow upper course of the River Sprint Goat Scar Raven Crag and Brown Crags are the main faces while Steel Pike appears from the valley bridleway as an independent rocky peak The remains of the large Wrengill Quarry are just north of here together with a mine entrance a little higher up the slope

The ridge northwards to Harter Fell drops to a wet depression and then climbs up the grassy ridge following first the wall and then a broken fence Southeastwards the ridge continues to the cairned top of Goat Scar which provides a good viewpoint for the craggy throat of Longsleddale From here the high ground turns due south to Shipman Knotts

The top of the fell is a grassy dome with a stone wall running along the ridge An Ordnance Survey column stands just to the east of the wall whilst a small summit cairn has been built to the west Both are of equivalent height The view of Lakeland is intermittent between the tops on the Ill Bell ridge the Coniston fells and a portion of the Scafell group being visible An open vista to the south encompasses Windermere and Morecambe Bay

Kentmere Pike is most commonly climbed indirectly as part of the Kentmere Horseshoe This circuit takes in the fine ridges on either side of the valley together with the higher fells at its head Direct ascents can also be made from either flank An ancient grooved path rises up the fellside from the end of High Lane in Kentmere meeting the ridgetop wall to the south of the summit From Longsleddale the walled track which leads to Gatesgarth Pass can be left just north of Steel Pike The line of an old fence is then followed to the ridge

The centre currently has six Flagship Projects

Functional Metamaterials and Metadevices Metamaterials are synthesised on the subwavelength scale to have optical properties refractive index dispersion that can differ dramatically from those of bulk materials perfect lenses cloaking and negative refractive index materials are examples CUDOS aims to develop metamaterials that will enable entirely new ways to control photons

Onchip Nanoplasmonics The refractive index of metals is very high so the wavelength of the optical modes is very short CUDOS is developing novel techniques to fabricate nanostructured composites of metals and optically transmitting materials They are investigating novel modes of light propagation in these materials and use them to create ultracompact devices like transmission lines and antennae The vision of this project is to develop three and twodimensional nanoplasmonic structures that can allow unprecedented control of light at the sub wavelength scale

Hybrid integration As metamaterials nanoplasmonic materials and new kinds of nonlinear optical materials are developed they need to be integrated with existing optical platforms of silicon or chalcogenide so that light can pass from one material to another on the same chip This project aims to develop novel designs for integrating such hybrid materials and novel fabrication techniques

MidInfrared Photonics The midinfrared region of the spectrum 3  10m has enormous potential for highly efficient sensing of molecules significant in agriculture natural resource management homeland security and others CUDOS developed photonic platforms and novel sources for this region

Nonlinear Quantum Photonics This research focuses on highly compact approaches based on nonlinear optics to generate single photons The aim is to achieve this on a chip and create a fully integrated flexible platform to generate these single photons and use them to perform quantumbased processing operations

Terabit per second Photonics Alloptical processing has the potential to replace electronics in many areas of ultrahigh bandwidth communications systems CUDOS is developing alloptical processors using nonlinear optics and investigating new approaches to enable much higher volumes of data to be carried per unit of optical bandwidth

CUDOS research has been working towards optical circuitry which could result in much faster speeds for data transmission

<doc id="7731831" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731831" title="Herbrand interpretation">
Herbrand interpretation
In mathematical logic a Herbrand interpretation is an interpretation in which all constants and function symbols are assigned very simple meanings Specifically every constant is interpreted as itself and every function symbol is interpreted as the function that applies it The interpretation also defines predicate symbols as denoting a subset of the relevant Herbrand base effectively specifying which ground atoms are true in the interpretation This allows the symbols in a set of clauses to be interpreted in a purely syntactic way separated from any real instantiation

The importance of Herbrand interpretations is that if any interpretation satisfies a given set of clauses S then there is a Herbrand interpretation that satisfies them Moreover Herbrands theorem states that if S is unsatisfiable then there is a finite unsatisfiable set of ground instances from the Herbrand universe defined by S Since this set is finite its unsatisfiability can be verified in finite time However there may be an infinite number of such sets to check 

It is named after Jacques Herbrand

Laugh Clown Laugh
Laugh Clown Laugh is a 1928 American silent drama film starring Lon Chaney and Loretta Young The movie was directed by Herbert Brenon and produced and released through MGM Studios

The film is based on the 1923 Broadway stage production Laugh Clown Laugh by David Belasco and Tom Cushing based on a 1919 play Ridi Pagliaccio by 

Tito Lon Chaney a traveling circus clown finds an abandoned child Tito adopts her and raises her as his daughter naming her Simonetta after his brother Simon Bernard Siegel One day the now teenaged Simonetta Loretta Young encounters Luigi Nils Asther a wealthy man who falls madly in love with her but upon seeing that he already has a girlfriend she rejects him She returns home to the circus and Tito suddenly realizes she is no longer a child Tito further realizes he has feelings for Simonetta but also knows his feelings are improper because he raised her as his daughter

Luigi begins having fits of uncontrollable laughter because Simonetta has rejected him Tito falls into melancholia because of his conflicted interests about Simonetta They both see the same doctor about their conditions and meet for the first time They share their respective troubles and believe they can help each other not knowing they both love the same woman Nonetheless the three eventually develop a strong friendship until Luigi asks Simonetta to marry him Simonetta eventually accepts Luigis proposal which throws Tito into an even deeper melancholy Simonetta learns of Titos affections for her before she marries Luigi She tells Tito she loved him before she loved Luigi then goes to break her engagement with Luigi

While Simonetta is breaking her engagement Tito and Simon begin rehearsing some new material for their Flik and Flok act Tito does not believe Simonettas love is genuine but that it is just pity and at the same time he knows that as her adopted father  it would not be right to have her as his wife Driven insane by his internal conflict he decides to practice his new routine from the act without protection Despite his brother Simons protests he continues with the stunt and falls from the highwire

Tito dies from his fall freeing Simonetta to marry Luigi

The film survives in an incomplete print but the missing footage does not critically affect the storyline The surviving print seems to end rather abruptly as the last few seconds of the fadeout are among the lost footage The alternate happy ending  wherein Tito survives his fall and Simonetta marries Luigi and they all remain close friends  shot at the studios insistence has also been lost


The film is based on the 1923 Broadway stage production Laugh Clown Laugh that starred Lionel Barrymore and his second wife Irene Fenwick in the role of Simonetta The play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing based on a 1919 story Ridi Pagliaccio by  ran at the Belasco Theatre from November 28 1923 to March 1924 for a total of 133 performances The production also featured Lucille Kahn in a supporting role

MGM delayed production of this film several years because Chaney had already appeared as a clown character in the 1924 film He Who Gets Slapped and due to speculation that Lionel Barrymore might reprise his role from the stage production As a substitute MGM would pair Barrymore with Chaney in West of Zanzibar

As a trouping comic stage actor in his youth Chaney would have been acquainted with clown performers of lesserknown fame In preparation for this film and He Who Gets Slapped Chaney also studied the clown makeup of circus performers and legendary 19thcentury clown stage actors like Joseph Grimaldi and George L Fox the latter of Humpty Dumpty fame The film was said to have been Chaneys favorite of all his roles

This film was Loretta Youngs first major movie role at the age of fourteen In interviews near the end of her life she expressed her gratitude toward Chaney for his kindness and guidance and for protecting her from director Brenons sometimes harsh treatment

An eponymous musical theme was written specially for the film It was seemingly played for audiences in movie theatres in the minutes before screenings of the movie It became a hit record Chaneys set musicians played the song at his 1930 funeral

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film three out of a possible four stars calling it  the perfect example of Chaneys unmatched talent for turning tearjerking melodrama into heartbreaking tragedy

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists

In January 2002 the third annual Young Film Composers Competition sponsored by Turner Classic Movies awarded the right to rescore this film to a college student named Scott Salinas In November 2002 he scored it at ToddAO with the film first aired in February 2003

AES53
AES53 is a standard first published in October 2006 by the Audio Engineering Society that specifies how the timing markers specified in AES47 may be used to associate an absolute timestamp with individual audio samples AES47 specifies a format for the transmission of digital audio over asynchronous transfer mode ATM networks A recommendation is made to refer these timestamps to the SMPTE epoch which in turn provides a reference to UTC and GPS time It thus provides a way of aligning streams from disparate sources including synchronizing audio to video and also allows the total delay across a network to be controlled when the transit time of individual cells is unknown This is most effective in systems where the audio is aligned with an absolute time reference such as GPS but can also be used with a local reference

Hackney Wick Stadium
Hackney Wick Stadium was a greyhound racing and speedway located at Waterden Road in the London Borough of Hackney

The site chose for the stadium was on land known as Hackney Marshes west of the River Lea and on the west side of the Waterden Road The stadium was constructed from September 1931 until 1932 and cost 70000 to build and after completion 18000 in wages had been paid to the builders

Hackney opened On Friday 8 April 1932 under the affiliation of the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society BGTCS the rival to the larger National Greyhound Racing Club Thirteen thousand people attended the first night and witnessed Marjorie Graves MP for South Hackney officially open the track The capacity of the track was put between 3000050000 and a totalisator had been installed for the first night A greyhound called Bullseye became the first ever winner at the track Although the meeting was advertised as the first official meeting there had been a dress rehearsal two days previous on Wednesday 6 April which attracted 12000 people

The company responsible for the project was Hackney Wick Stadium Ltd headed by Managing Director Arthur Gilbert and Racing Manager Fred Whitehead with William Chandler also holding shares in the new company Chandler would in due course buy the Crooked Billet independent track and turn it into Walthamstow Stadium one year later

After World War II Hendon Greyhound Stadium and Hackney Wick merged to become the Hackney and Hendon Greyhounds Ltd company The resident kennels featured six ranges with each able to house up to fifty greyhounds paddocks sat next to each range with cooking facilities and a veterinary surgeon on site The kennel fees were 17s 6d for each greyhound

In the early 1950s Mr S Pay became the Racing Manager after Fred Whitehead was promoted to Director of Racing for both Hackney and Hendon Pay was later replaced by Hendon Racing Manager D G Lewis before Michael Marksbecame Racing Manager for three decades until the day the stadium closed The stadium offered eight buffet and licensed bars during racing held on Thursday and Saturday nights at 745pm The circuit had a circumference of 472 yards and the greyhounds raced behind an Outside Sumner hare system Trainers in the 1960s included Annetts Reg Bosley Brown Colebrooke Cox Paddy Gordon Hedley and Lionel Maxen

In the 1970s Mr GCrookbank the tracks chief electrician had invented photoelectric timing gear that would revolutionise the sport Hand timing would become a thing of the past after Crookbank came up with the idea that a greyhounds race time could be recorded electronically The invention known as Automatic Ray Timing would remain as the timing method until the advent of modern computer timing The Hackney sales became a major feature of business throughout the year these sales became a prominent way for buying and selling greyhounds in London

In 1969 Park Royal Stadium and New Cross Stadium both closed resulting in the Bookmakers Afternoon Greyhound Service BAGS being switched to Hendon and Hackney the racing image of Hackney would change forever as it became the number one BAGS track Afternoon meetings were introduced and eventually there would be no evening meetings at the track with the Saturday matinee BAGS replacing the Saturday night

In 1970 businessman George Walker brother of boxing champion Billy Walker arranged a reverse takeover of Hackney and Hendon Greyhounds Stadium Ltd This meant his private company bought a public company and the new merger resulted in a new company called Brent Walker This resulted in the end for the Hendon Greyhound Stadium because it was sold to make way for the UKs first standalone shopping centre on the site that would soon be known as the Brent Cross shopping centre

It was not until the closure of sister track Hendon that Hackney Wick hosted a competition of note The Guineas long associated with Park Royal had switched to Hendon in 1969 which in turn now found its way to Hackney Three years later The Lead was introduced and would also become a valuable addition to the calendar In 1976 local hound Westmead Champ trained by Pam Heasman reached the final of the English Greyhound Derby and was voted Greyhound of the Year

Hackney fell out with the NGRC in 1987 when the governing body announced that they would charge 300 to a track staging a BAGS meeting covered by Satellite Information Services SIS plus ten percent of the tracks BAGS fees Hackney refused and Ladbrokes took legal advice over the situation but all BAGS tracks would eventually pay a fee to the NGRC Another race called the Lincoln was hosted by Hackney from 1986 and in 1988 Minnies Siren trained by Terry Duggan won the BBC Television Trophy Brent Walker bought William HillMecca from Grand Metropolitan in 1989 and one year later leading trainer John Ginger McGee Sr joined the track


During 1991 it transpired that Brent Walker had amassed debts of 12 billion George Walker was removed from the board and the banker took control of the companys assets With the bank controlling matters there were numerous rumours about the future of the track By 1994 the stadium had been acquired by a company called London Stadium Hackney Ltd who were in turn owned by Fleetfoot Racing formed in 1992 Work began on an ambitious project including a 12 million restaurant and state of the art facilities leading trainers were recruited and the stadium was rebranded The London Stadium

At the end of 1994 exLloyds broker and racing journalist Robert Parker left the company as its director to be replaced by Stephen Rea Beset with construction problems and internal disagreements the original 14 million scheme to develop the neglected stadium had run into serious problems Extra cash was raised by rights issues with companies including Rothschild Henderson Venture Managers and Samuel Montagu In October 1995 the new stadium was finally ready offering firstclass facilities and significantly high prize money However on the reopening night and despite a capacity crowd the stadium went into receivership the same evening Investigations began and Parker was pursued by Roger Cook on ITVs television program The Cook Report Fleetfoot Racing Ltd had lasted just three years and the stadium was closed on 4 January 1997

The stadium was left derelict for several years until it was bought by the London Development Agency and demolished in 2003 The site was the location of the London Olympics Media Centre the main media and broadcasting centre for the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics

Hackney Wick Wolves speedway team raced there before World War II  The Hackney Hawks speedway team rode at the venue from 1963 to 1983 Hackney Kestrels speedway team rode here from 1984 until 1990 In 1996 a speedway team under the name of London Lions rode but it was found to be financially unviable

The British Speedway Grand Prix was held at the stadium in 1995 and 1996

The speedway track was in length

European Grand Prix for Choral Singing
The European Grand Prix for Choral Singing in French Grand Prix Europen de Chant Choral commonly abbreviated as European Choral Grand Prix or GPE is an annual choral competition between the winners of six European choral competitions It was inaugurated in 1989

Despite its name the GPE is not limited to European choirs this is because choirs from any country can join the choral competitions in any of the GPEs membercities  one choir from Japan one choir from Argentina one choir from Indonesia and two choirs from the United States have won the GPE while two choirs from the Philippines and United States has won the GPE twice In addition the contest is not limited to adult choirs three of the grand prizewinning choirs are childrens choirs

As of 2018 five choirs have won the EGP twice the Philippine Madrigal Singers 1997 and 2007 APZ Tone Tomi 2002 and 2008 Youth choir Kamr 2004 and 2013 University of Utah Chamber Choir renamed from the University of Utah Singers 2006 and 2015 and Vesna Childrens Choir 2000 and 2017

As of 2010 only one conductor has won the EGP twice Stojan Kuret 2002 and 2010

The GPE is organized by the organizing committees of the following choral competitions from which the GPE contenders are selected

Each individual contest is usually referred to by the name of its host city instead of the competitions official title The grand prize winners of each contest are automatically eligible to compete at the GPE

The hosting of each annual GPE competition is rotated among the six member cities

The European Grand Prix for Choral Singing was created in 1988 through the initiative of the competitions of AREZZO Italy DEBRECEN Hungary GORIZIA Italy and TOURS France Two others have also been associated VARNA Bulgaria in 1989 and TOLOSA Basque CountrySpain in 1990 In 2008 Gorizia stepped out of the Association and MARIBOR Slovenia joined it

As mentioned earlier the contest is open only to the grand prize winners of the six member European choral competitions in the previous year In other words if a choir wins the grand prize in any of the six cities choral contests it is eligible for then next years GPE Consequently this also means that unlike other choral competitions the GPE does not solicit participants to the contest no choir may directly apply or audition in order to join the GPE If an eligible choir backs out a substitute choir may take its place as a penalty any choir that backs out will not be eligible to compete in any of the six qualifying contests for the next year

No choir may win the grand prize in more than one qualifying competition in a single year For example if a choir is named the grand prize winner in Arezzo it is automatically disqualified to compete in the contests from the five remaining cities for the rest of the year

There are no specific regulations prohibiting a former finalist or even a former laureate from competing in or even winning again the GPE more than once The Philippine Madrigal Singers laureate of the 1997 GPE have won the 2006 Florilge Vocal de Tours going on to win the Grand Prize in 2007 in Arezzo Italy In the same competition the Madrigal Singers competed with the Vesna Childrens Choir laureate of the 2000 GPE who won the grand prize of the 2006 Tolosa competition

Each competing choir is required to sing in the same groupcategory as they performed in respective competitions Choirs are encouraged to perform songs from various eras and composers Songs with accompaniment by any instrument are allowed as long as the total length of accompanied songs does not exceed ten 10 minutes The host city determines the total maximum performance time allowed to each finalist

Each competing choir is also required to have the same number of singers it had from the qualifying competition plus or minus ten percent 10 of that number The total number of singers per choir may be a minimum of 12 singers and a maximum of 60 singers regardless of the number of voice sections or groups this is because the eligibility requirements vary for each of the six qualifying competitions Because of this it is possible for mixedvoice choirs to compete directly against allmale and allfemale choirs it is also possible for childrens choirs to compete against adult choirs and even win as in 2000 2001 2017 and 2018

The GPE grand prize winner or laureate is awarded a diploma a trophy and additional prizes to be determined by the host city including a cash prize of up to 4000 Euros usually awarded

The GPE winner is not allowed to compete in any international choral competition member of the European Grand Prix Association for two years

<doc id="7731934" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7731934" title="Gamma secretase">
Gamma secretase
Gamma secretase is a multisubunit protease complex itself an integral membrane protein that cleaves singlepass transmembrane proteins at residues within the transmembrane domain Proteases of this type are known as intramembrane proteases The most wellknown substrate of gamma secretase is amyloid precursor protein a large integral membrane protein that when cleaved by both gamma and beta secretase produces a short 42 amino acid peptide called amyloid beta whose abnormally folded fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimers disease patients Gamma secretase is also critical in the related processing of several other type I integral membrane proteins such as Notch ErbB4 Ecadherin Ncadherin ephrinB2 or CD44

The gamma secretase complex consists of four individual proteins PSEN1 presenilin1 nicastrin APH1 anterior pharynxdefective 1 and PEN2 presenilin enhancer 2 Recent evidence suggests that a fifth protein known as CD147 is a nonessential regulator of the complex whose absence increases activity Presenilin an aspartyl protease is the catalytic subunit mutations in the presenilin gene have been shown to be a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease In humans two forms of presenilin and two forms of APH1 have been identified in the genome one of the APH homologs can also be expressed in two isoforms via alternative splicing leading to at least six different possible gamma secretase complexes that may have tissue or cell type specificity

The proteins in the gamma secretase complex are heavily modified by proteolysis during assembly and maturation of the complex a required activation step is in the autocatalytic cleavage of presenilin to N and Cterminal fragments Nicastrins primary role is in maintaining the stability of the assembled complex and regulating intracellular protein trafficking PEN2 associates with the complex via binding of a transmembrane domain of presenilin and among other possible roles helps to stabilize the complex after presenilin proteolysis has generated the activated Nterminal and Cterminal fragments APH1 which is required for proteolytic activity binds to the complex via a conserved alpha helix interaction motif and aids in initiating assembly of premature components

Recent research has shown that interaction of the gamma secretase complex with the secretase activating protein facilitates the gamma cleavage of amyloid precursor protein into amyloid

The gamma secretase complex is thought to assemble and mature via proteolysis in the early endoplasmic reticulum The complexes are then transported to the late ER where they interact with and cleave their substrate proteins Gamma secretase complexes have also been observed localized to the mitochondria where they may play a role in promoting apoptosis

Gamma secretase is an internal protease that cleaves within the membranespanning domain of its substrate proteins including amyloid precursor protein APP and Notch Substrate recognition occurs via nicastrin ectodomain binding to the Nterminus of the target which is then passed via a poorly understood process between the two presenilin fragments to a watercontaining active site where the catalytic aspartate residue is located The active site must contain water to carry out hydrolysis within a hydrophobic environment in the interior of the cell membrane although it is not well understood how water and proton exchange is effected and as yet no Xray crystallography structure of gamma secretase is available Lowresolution electron microscopy reconstructions have allowed the visualization of the hypothesized internal pores of about 2 nanometres In 2014 a threedimensional structure of an intact human gammasecretase complex was determined by cryoelectron microscopy singleparticle analysis at 45 angstrom resolution and in 2015 an atomicresolution 34 angstrom cryoEM structure was reported

The gamma secretase complex is unusual among proteases in having a sloppy cleavage site at the Cterminal site in amyloid beta generation gamma secretase can cleave APP in any of multiple sites to generate a peptide of variable length most typically from 39 to 42 amino acids long with A40 the most common isoform and A42 the most susceptible to conformational changes leading to amyloid fibrillogenesis Certain mutations in both APP and in both types of human presenilin are associated with increased A42 production and the earlyonset genetic form of familial Alzheimers disease Although older data suggested that different forms of the gamma secretase complex could be differentially responsible for generating different amyloid beta isoforms current evidence indicates that the Cterminus of amyloid beta is produced by a series of singleresidue cleavages by the same gamma secretase complex Earlier cleavage sites produce peptides of length 46 zetacleavage and 49 epsiloncleavage

History of Arsenal FC 18861966
The history of Arsenal Football Club between 1886 and 1966 covers the time from the clubs foundation through the first two major periods of success the 1930s and the late 1940s and early 1950s respectively and the clubs subsequent decline to midtable status in the 1960s

Arsenal Football Club was founded in 1886 as a munition workers team from Woolwich then in Kent now southeast London They turned professional in 1891 and joined The Football League two years later They were promoted to the First Division in 1904 but financial problems meant they were liquidated and reformed They were bought out by Sir Henry Norris that year and to improve the clubs financial standing he moved the team to Arsenal Stadium Highbury north London in 1913 After the First World War he arranged for the clubs promotion back to the First Division in controversial circumstances

It was not until the appointment of Herbert Chapman in 1925 that Arsenal had their first period of major success Chapman modernised and reformed the clubs practices and tactics and under him and his successor George Allison who took over after Chapmans death in January 1934 Arsenal won five First Division titles and two FA Cups in the 1930s After the Second World War Tom Whittaker continued the success leading the club to two First Division titles and an FA Cup After Whittakers death Arsenals fortunes gradually declined by 1966 they were in midtable obscurity and had not won a trophy in thirteen years This led to the dismissal of Billy Wright as manager in 1966 and with it the appointment of Bertie Mee who would go on to turn around the clubs fortunes

Arsenal were founded as Dial Square in 1886 by a group of workers employed by the Dial Square workshop at the Royal Arsenal an armaments factory in Woolwich Kent formally part of the new County of London from 1889 They were led by a Scotsman David Danskin who purchased the clubs first football and Jack Humble Among their number was the former Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Fred Beardsley who would later along with Morris Bates obtain a set of red kits from his old club thus giving Arsenal the colours they still wear today

Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886 against Eastern Wanderers on an open field on the Isle of Dogs which they won 60 The club were renamed Royal Arsenal soon after reportedly on Christmas Day Initially the club played on Plumstead Common but soon sought alternative homes firstly the Sportsman Ground in Plumstead before moving to the adjacent Manor Ground in 1888 Unhappy with the Manor Grounds poor facilities the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890 before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Grounds rent proved too expensive

During this period Royal Arsenal started to win local trophies winning both the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity Cup in 188990 and the London Senior Cup in 189091 they also entered the FA Cup for the first time in 188990 However the gulf between Arsenal and the professional sides from the North soon became apparent and Arsenal faced the threat of their amateur players being lured away by the money professional sides could offer after Derby County had played Arsenal in an FA Cup tie in 1891 they attempted to sign two of Arsenals amateur players on professional contracts
Royal Arsenals move to professionalism in 1891 was frowned upon by many of the amateur southern clubs and they were banned from participating in local competitions by the London Football Association With friendlies and the FA Cup the only matches available for Royal Arsenal they attempted to set up a southern equivalent of The Football League but the move failed The club changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal in 1893 when it formed a limited liability company to raise capital to purchase the Manor Ground Woolwich Arsenals future looked bleak until the Football League came to their rescue by inviting them to join in 1893 Arsenal were the first Southern club to enter the League initially joining the Second Division in response some of the clubs amateur players who rejected professionalism and wanted a workers team to represent just the Royal Arsenal broke away to form a shortlived alternative side Royal Ordnance Factories
Woolwich Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons and generally occupied midtable before the appointment of Harry Bradshaw as manager in 1899 Bradshaw and his star signings including goalkeeper Jimmy Ashcroft Arsenals first England international and captain Jimmy Jackson won promotion to the First Division in 190304 However Bradshaw moved on to Fulham in May 1904 before the Gunners had kicked a ball in the top flight Despite some strong performances in the FA Cup the club reached the semifinals in 190506 and 190607 Arsenal were never able to challenge for the League title only twice finishing above tenth place in the First Division between 1904 and 1913

The cause of this decline was the clubs ongoing financial problems despite the boom in football during the early 20th century the clubs geographic isolation in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead then on the outskirts of urban London meant attendances and thus income were low To stay afloat Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players including Ashcroft as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman and slowly started to slip down the table which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell By the end of the decade the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11000 a little over half of what it had been in 1904 The club were close to bankruptcy and in 1910 went into voluntary liquidation before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris who was also the chairman of Fulham

Norris was acutely aware of the problems associated with Woolwich Arsenals location and was desperate to improve the clubs income First Norris tried to merge Woolwich Arsenal with his other club Fulham When that was blocked by the Football League Norris abandoned the merger and looked to move the club elsewhere eventually picking a site in Highbury north London Despite objections both from Woolwichbased fans and residents of Highbury Norris tenaciously saw the move through He reportedly spent 125000  Historic Opportunity cost of that project is 12530000
Labour cost of that project is 42450000
Economic cost of that project is 88070000 on building the new stadium designed by Archibald Leitch on a divinity colleges playing fields Woolwich Arsenal moved there in the 1913 close season having finished bottom and relegated to the Second Division in 191213 They replaced the Woolwich in their name with The in April 1914 finally becoming plain Arsenal in November 1919 although the press at the time continued to refer to them as The Arsenal and some still do The move to Highbury brought about much larger crowds the average attendance in Arsenals first season at the new ground was 23000 compared to 11000 at the Manor Ground and rose further after promotion in 1919 finally warding off the spectre of financial ruin

The club controversially rejoined the First Division in 1919 despite only finishing sixth in 191415 the last season of competitive football before the First World War had intervened  although an error in the calculation of goal average meant Arsenal had actually finished fifth an error which was corrected by the Football League in 1975 The First Division was being expanded from 20 teams to 22 and the two new entrants were elected at an AGM of the Football League On past precedent the two places would be given to the two clubs that would otherwise have been relegated namely Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur Instead one of the extra places was awarded to Chelsea  who had been the victims of a betting controversy  and a ballot was called for the remaining place The candidates included 20thplaced Tottenham Hotspur and from the second division Barnsley who had finished third Wolves fourth Birmingham fifth later amended to sixth Hull City seventh and Nottingham Forest eighteenth

The League voted to promote sixthplaced Arsenal for reasons of history over merit Norris argued that Arsenal be promoted for their long service to league football having been the first League club from the South The League board agreed Arsenal received 18 votes Tottenham 8 Barnsley 5 Wolves 4 with a further 6 votes shared between the other clubs

According to Soar and Tyler the announcement of the vote seemed to catch all the clubs except Arsenal unawares and the affair is a major contributing factor to the rivalry which has fuelled the longstanding enmity between the two North London clubs There is also an inconsistency in the argument  if long service to league football was the criterion for promoting Arsenal instead of Tottenham then Wolves who finished two points ahead of Arsenal and were founder members of the Football League would appear to have a stronger claim It has been alleged that this was due to backroom deals or even outright bribery by Sir Henry Norris colluding with his friend John McKenna the chairman of Liverpool and the Football League who recommended Arsenals promotion at the AGM

No conclusive proof of wrongdoing has come to light though other aspects of Norriss financial dealings unrelated to the promotion controversy have fuelled speculation on the matter Norris resigned as chairman and left the club in 1929 having been found guilty by the Football Association of financial irregularities he was found to have misused his expenses account and to have pocketed the proceeds of the sale of the Arsenal team bus Regardless of the circumstances of their promotion in 1919 Arsenal have remained in the top division since then and as a result hold the English record for the longest unbroken stretch of topflight football

There appear to be no extant records of the meetings which elected Arsenal to the First Division in 1919 however the book Making the Arsenal proposes a different reason for their election in that year The site argues that the match fixing issues of the final year of football before the war 191415 were used by Norris as a weapon in his battle to get Arsenal promoted He demanded that Liverpool and Manchester United some of whose players had been found guilty of match fixing be punished by relegation or expulsion and threatened to organise a breakaway from the league by Midlands and southern clubs if nothing was done To placate him the League offered Arsenal a place in the First Division

The clubs return to the First Division was not immediately successful Under Leslie Knighton the club never finished better than ninth and in 192324 came close to returning to the Second Division finishing 19th and only a point clear of the relegation zone Arsenal did no better the following season finishing 20th although paradoxically the club were a lot safer this time being seven points clear of the relegation places which was the last straw for Norris he fired Knighton in May 1925 and appointed the Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in his place

Chapman reformed many of the clubs practices including modernising the training and physiotherapy regimes adding numbers to the players shirts in August 1928 and changing the teams colours adding white sleeves to the red shirt in March 1933 Chapman also insisted on journalists dropping the definite article from the clubs name becoming just Arsenal and he successfully campaigned for the renaming of the local Tube station Gillespie Road to Arsenal At the same time Chapman had a large transfer budget by virtue of Arsenals improved revenue from their new stadium and a change of heart from Henry Norris previously a highly prudent chairman Norris now dictated that there was to be heavy spending on new players This led to Arsenal becoming known as the Bank of England club

Chapmans first signing was veteran Charlie Buchan from Sunderland as well as his contributions on the pitch Buchan would play an important part off it After Arsenal were beaten 70 by Newcastle United in October 1925 Buchan suggested a change to the formation to adapt to a relaxation of the offside law adjusting Arsenals formation to the WM strengthening the defence by pushing the centre half back into defence and the fullbacks out to the wings Over time Chapman developed the formation further putting an emphasis on a pacey forward line wingers cutting inside and the role of a creative ballplaying midfielder

Arsenal came second in Chapmans first season their best finish at that time but this proved to be a false dawn for the next few seasons they stayed in midtable as Chapman took his time to assemble his side slotting new signings such as winger Joe Hulme forward Jack Lambert and defenders Tom Parker and Herbie Roberts into his new formation In 192627 Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final only to lose 10 to Cardiff City after Arsenals goalkeeper Dan Lewis let a harmlesslooking shot slip through his arms and into the net it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England

Chapman was not deterred and continued to build his side signing future captain Eddie Hapgood as well as three of the clubs great attacking players David Jack Alex James and Cliff Bastin it was especially Alex James Arsenals playmaker in midfield supplying the forward line and wingers who became celebrated as the engine of the team Three years after their first Cup final in 192930 Arsenal reached Wembley again this time up against Chapmans old club Huddersfield Town The match was notable for being buzzed by the enormous German airship Graf Zeppelin Arsenal were not distracted from their task they won 20 with goals from James and Lambert to bring home the clubs first major trophy

On 30 August 1930 Arsenal helped create a new attendance record of 28723 at Blackpools Bloomfield Road ground They helped set it again over the next two seasons with crowds of 29576 and 30218

Their FA Cup success was the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the dominant club in England They won the First Division for the first time in 193031 Arsenal performed strongly in a freescoring title race with Aston Villa recording several heavy wins including 71 against Blackpool 72 v Leicester City and 91 v Grimsby Town which remains a club record for the top flight Arsenal won the title with two games to spare and finished the season having scored 127 league goals another club record though Aston Villa managed to score 128 which is still a record for the most goals in an English top flight season
The following season 193132 Arsenal reached the FA Cup final again losing controversially to Newcastle United Arsenal had led 10 with a Bob John goal but Newcastles equaliser came after a long ball had gone over the goal line and out for a goal kick Newcastle winger Jimmy Richardson nevertheless crossed the ball back into play and Jack Allen levelled the match for the Magpies Allen scored again in the second half to win the match 21 Arsenals pain was compounded by the fact that Everton had pipped them to the League title a poor start to the 193132 campaign meant Arsenal played catchup for most of the season finishing two points adrift

Arsenal bounced back the following season winning their second League title Arsenal had started the season weakly but then went on a long winning run to catch up and then overtake fellow title challengers Aston Villa whom they beat 50 at Highbury in April to clinch the title By this time Chapmans first set of signings had started to show their age so with an eye to the future Chapman promoted George Male to the first team to replace Tom Parker and signed Ray Bowden to take over from David Jack The only blot on the clubs record was an infamous loss to Walsall of the Third Division North in the FA Cup five of the first team were out with injury or flu and had their place taken by reserves and without them Arsenal lost 20 in one of the greatest FA Cup upsets of all time One of the standins Tommy Black was particularly to blame conceding a penalty for Walsalls second and was sold by an enraged Chapman to Plymouth Argyle within a week of the result another striker Charlie Walsh was transferred to Brentford a week later

Arsenal had started the 193334 season solidly but in January 1934 Herbert Chapman died suddenly from pneumonia Despite this under caretaker manager Joe Shaw Arsenal retained the title that season Hulme and James were both out with injury for a large portion and so Arsenal were not the attacking side they had been the previous season scoring only 75 in the League compared with 118 in 193233

George Allison who had formerly been a director of the club took over the job of team manager in summer 1934 and soon signed new blood for the side including wing halves Jack Crayston and Wilf Copping whose signings had been initiated by Chapman and striker Ted Drake With these new signings Allison oversaw the completion of a hattrick of League titles in 193435 and Arsenal were back to their attacking best Drake scored a club record 42 league goals that season and Arsenal racked up a series of heavily onesided scorelines reminiscent of the 193031 season including 70 v Wolves 81 v Liverpool and 80 twice v Leicester City and v Middlesbrough Such was Arsenals strength that in November 1934 seven players that started for the England side that beat World Champions Italy 32 in the socalled Battle of Highbury were on Arsenals books a record number of players from a single club which still stands today

Arsenals ongoing success attracted larger and larger crowds Arsenals home Highbury was completely redeveloped with Leitchs stands from 1913 demolished and replaced with modern Art Deco stands parts of which remain to this day  the faade of the East Stand is now a Grade II listed building and both faades have been retained as part of the modernday redevelopment of Highbury into an apartment complex Meanwhile the North Bank and Clock End terraces had roofs installed The new stadium saw its largest attendance 73295 on 9 March 1935 for a match against Sunderland

Arsenals dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 193536 winning 10 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 193435 title and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the clubs inability to replace him as well as longterm injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme Nevertheless they won a fifth League title in 193738 pipping Wolves on the final day of the season to cap off a highly successful decade

Soon after the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 all firstclass football in Britain was suspended and the 193940 Football League season annulled Highbury was requisitioned as an ARP station with a barrage balloon operating behind the Clock End During the Blitz a bomb fell on the North Bank destroying the roof and setting fire to the scrap that was being stored on the terrace With Highbury closed Arsenal instead played their home matches at White Hart Lane home of their rivals Tottenham Hotspur Wartime matches do not count in official statistics competitions were played on a regional basis and teams often did not complete a full season many footballers served in the armed forces as trainers or instructors and were away from their clubs for long periods of time so they would often star as guests at other clubs Arsenal won the Football League War Cup South in 194243 and the London or Southern league titles in 193940 194142 and 194243 Participation in the London League led to their expulsion from The Football League in 1941 along with 14 other clubs it was not until April 1942 when they were readmitted after expressing regret and paying a 10 fine

In November 1945 with league competition still suspended Arsenal were one of the teams that played a Dynamo Moscow side touring the UK With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen which led Dynamo to declare they were playing an England XI although three of the side were actually Welsh In any case Dynamo themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow The match at White Hart Lane kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient Dynamo won 43 after Arsenal had led 31 at halftime

Though the score is generally agreed upon after that accounts of the match diverge even the identity of the goalscorers is disputed English reports alleged Dynamo fielded twelve players at one point and tried to pressurise the referee into abandoning the match when they had been behind in turn the Soviets accused Arsenal of persistent foul play and even alleged George Allison had bet money on the result a claim that was later retracted The acrimony after the match was such that it inspired George Orwell to write his 1945 essay The Sporting Spirit in which he famously opined on the nature of sport namely that in his view it is war minus the shooting With the fog obscuring much of the action not to mention the language barriers and the earlyCold War mutual suspicion between both sides it is unlikely any reliable account of the match will emerge

The war had claimed the lives of nine Arsenal first team players the most of any top flight club and the intervening time had cut short the careers of several others including Bastin and Drake Additionally the debts from the construction of Highbury and the costs of repairing war damage were a heavy financial burden and Arsenal struggled at first when competitive football resumed in 1946 They lost 61 on aggregate to West Ham United in the third round of the 194546 FA Cup and upon the leagues resumption in 194647 the club finished 13th their worst in 17 years George Allison decided to retire from football at the end of that season and was replaced by his assistant Tom Whittaker a longtime servant of the club who had been trainer under Chapman

Whittaker enjoyed immediate success winning the League title in 194748 led by captain Joe Mercers strong defence and with goals from attacking front two of Reg Lewis and Ronnie Rooke Arsenal were top of the table from October until the seasons climax winning by a sevenpoint margin However given the age of the Arsenal side at the time Rooke and Mercer were both over thirty as were Denis and Leslie Compton longterm success was not possible In response Whittaker had brought in younger players such as Doug Lishman Alex Forbes and Cliff Holton Although Arsenal were unable to sustain any challenges for the League title with the new blood they won the FA Cup in 194950 with Reg Lewis scoring both goals in a 20 win over Liverpool

The 195152 season saw the club nearly win the Double but ultimately end up emptyhanded a series of injuries and a fixture pileup at the end of the season saw Arsenal lose their last two matches including the title decider against eventual champions Manchester United at Old Trafford on the last day of the season after losing 61 the Gunners finished third equal on points with Tottenham A week later Arsenal played Newcastle United in the 1952 FA Cup Final with several recovering players rushed back into the first team Walley Barnes was taken off injured with a twisted knee after 35 minutes no substitutes were allowed then and tenman Arsenal suffered further injuries to Holton Roper and Daniel so that by the end of the match they had only seven fit players on the pitch with the numerical advantage in their favour Newcastle won 10 with a goal from George Robledo

Despite the disappointment of the previous season Arsenal won their seventh League title in 195253 in one of the closest title races they beat Preston North End to the title on goal average after finishing level on points The title looked to be Prestons after Arsenal lost to them 20 at Deepdale in the penultimate game of the season but Arsenal came from behind to beat Burnley 32 to take the title on 0099 of a goal That proved to be Arsenals last trophy for seventeen years as Arsenals fortunes began to wane particularly after the unexpected death of Tom Whittaker in October 1956

As the clubs fortunes declined they found themselves unable to attract many stars Welsh international goalkeeper Jack Kelsey being a notable exception while up and coming players such as David Herd left for more successful clubs Jack Crayston and George Swindin both former players followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success Apart from finishing third in 195859 and fifth in both 195556 and 195657 Arsenal usually finished in midtable Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup  after reaching the final in 195152 Arsenal would not get beyond the quarterfinals again until 197071 To make matters worse for the club Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 196061

In 1962 Arsenal made the bold but ultimately unsuccessful step of appointing former England and Wolves captain Billy Wright as manager despite his lack of managerial experience and the fact he had no prior experience with the club Like his two immediate predecessors Wright was not very successful although it was under his leadership that the club made their debut in European competition in the 196364 InterCities Fairs Cup after finishing seventh in 196263 In his final season Arsenal finished 14th their lowest position in 36 years and recorded the lowest attendance at Highbury  4554 in a match against Leeds United on 5 May 1966 The only Arsenal player to figure in Englands 1966 FIFA World Cupwinning squad was George Eastham who did not play at all during the tournament Wright was dismissed by the Arsenal board in the summer of 1966 and was replaced by club physiotherapist Bertie Mee Though the clubs directors did not know it at the time Mee would turn around the club and lead them to success both in Europe and at home within the next five years

Surprise Lake Camp
Surprise Lake Camp is a nonprofit sleepaway camp located on over in Cold Spring New York approximately north of New York City It is one of the oldest Jewish summer camps in the United States

Founded in 1901 by the Educational Alliance as a camp for Jewish boys from the tenements of Manhattans Lower East Side around the lake that Breakneck Brook rises from it incorporated as Surprise Lake Camp in 1902 In 1911 the 92nd Street Y joined in the operation of the camp and in 1917 the camp became an independent agency within the newly formed Federation of Jewish Philanthropies The camp continues to operate as a summer camp for children from the New York metropolitan area In 2005 the camp sold 200 acres and granted a conservation easement over an additional 465 acres of camp property to the Open Space Institute thus ensuring the preservation of these undeveloped lands adjacent to Hudson Highlands State Park The camp was the setting of a popular 2013 viral video on the topic of feminine hygiene entitled Camp Gyno

In its early years of operation the camp was subjected to antisemitic demonstrations of cross burning by local members of the Ku Klux Klan but the camp developed a better relationship with the surrounding residents over time For its campers who came from immigrant homes many of them Yiddishspeaking the camp emphasized acculturation to mainstream American styles of speech and appearance Surprise Lake Camp is part of a largescale archival project directed by YIVO the Institute for Jewish Research with the goal of preserving the historical record of the Jews of New York City

Among Surprise Lakes first campers was Eddie Cantor who credited his youthful performances at Surprise Lake Camp also depicted in the 1953 biopic The Eddie Cantor Story with giving him the encouragement to pursue show business Upon achieving success as an entertainer he became one of the camps most ardent supporters He was a member of the Surprise Lake Camp Board of Directors and a theater at the camp was named for him

Other notable Surprise Lake campers have included Neil Diamond who has identified Pete Seegers visits to the camp as his earliest exposure to a musical role model Jax Joseph Heller Jerry Stiller Gene Simmons Larry King Neil Simon Cody Brotter and Walter Matthau

History of Arsenal FC 1966present
The history of Arsenal Football Club from 1966 to the present day covers the third fourth and fifth periods of success in Arsenals history including three Doubles a Cup Double and success in European football

Following Bertie Mees appointment in 1966 Arsenal won the InterCities Fairs Cup their first European trophy in 196970 and their first League and FA Cup double in 197071 The Doublewinning side however was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses Arsenal lost three FA Cup finals 197172 197778 and 197980 and the 197980 Cup Winners Cup final on penalties The clubs only success during this time was an FA Cup win in 197879 against Manchester United

After stagnation in the 1980s the return of former player George Graham as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory Arsenal won the League Cup in 198687 the Football League Centenary Trophy in 1988 two League title wins in 198889 and 199091 the FA Cup and League Cup double in 199293 and a second European trophy the Cup Winners Cup in 199394 However Grahams reputation was tarnished when it was revealed that he had taken kickbacks for signing certain players and he was sacked in 1995

Arsenal fifth period of success came with the appointment of Arsne Wenger in 1996 Under him Arsenal won a second league and cup double in 199798 and then a third in 200102 In addition the club were victorious in the 200203 and 200405 FA Cups and won the Premier League in 200304 without losing a single match In 200506 became the first London club to reach the UEFA Champions League Final and lost 21 against FC Barcelona During the following close season they left their longstanding home of Highbury to the new Emirates Stadium nearbyTheir new home would unfortunately see a trophy drought for the next seven yearsThe Emirates Stadium would have something to celebrate as Arsenal would win 3 FA Cups for the next four seasons

Following the dismissal of Billy Wright in the summer of 1966 Arsenal appointed physiotherapist Bertie Mee as his successor The move that brought surprise to some not least Mee himself who requested that he be able to return to his old role as physio if being manager had not worked out after 12 months With assistant Dave Sexton Mee brought a more professional approach to the club and promoted talent from within Arsenals youth team had won the FA Youth Cup in 1966 and talented attacking players such as Charlie George John Radford Peter Simpson and Ray Kennedy graduated to the first team

Mee complemented this attacking ability with some more experienced heads captain Frank McLintock at centre half marshalled a strong defence while the hardtackling Peter Storey filled the defensive midfield position The team showed early signs of promise reaching two successive League Cup finals in 1968 and 1969 Both times the Gunners went home emptyhanded The first time Arsenal lost to Don Revies Leeds United 10 in a dour match of few chances Terry Cooper grabbing the only goal

The second League Cup loss was an infamous upset  Arsenal lost 31 to Third Division side Swindon Town Eight of the team had been struck by flu that had led to the postponement of Arsenals previous League fixture and Arsenal had only reached extra time thanks to a late goalkeeping error that had allowed Bobby Gould to score In extra time Don Rogers scored twice as Arsenal searched for a winner However that season was not a total disaster for Arsenal they had also finished fourth which won them a place in Europe for the 196970 season

In turn this led to the club collecting their first silverware in seventeen years and also their first European trophy the 196970 InterCities Fairs Cup Arsenal beat Ajax 31 on aggregate in the semifinals and then staged a famous comeback against Anderlecht in the final Arsenal were 30 down after 74 minutes of the first leg at Stade mile Vers but Ray Kennedy got a late away goal to give the Gunners a glimmer of hope in the second leg in front of a packed Highbury inspired by captain Frank McLintock Arsenal won 30 with goals from John Radford Eddie Kelly and Jon Sammels to win the tie 43 on aggregate

The same season Arsenal had only finished 12th in the league perhaps distracted by their European campaign and did not look like league contenders Yet the following season 197071 Arsenal went on to become only the second club of the 20th century to win the FA Cup and League Double the clubs first After a bright start Arsenal looked to be out of the title chase with a 50 loss to Stoke City in September However Arsenal recovered and put in a strong run they did not lose again in the league until January and as the season closed they became involved in a tight race with Leeds United

Arsenal were pushed all the way  after being defeated 10 by Leeds in April they needed to beat or draw 00 with North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on the last day of the season to take the title on goal average An 87thminute goal by Ray Kennedy gave Arsenal a 10 lead and despite Spurs desperate attempts for an equaliser Arsenal hung on to win and take the title In the meantime Arsenal had also reached the FA Cup Final following a titanic semifinal battle with Stoke which saw them come from 20 down to force a replay and eventual victory In the Final five days after the win at Tottenham Arsenal beat Liverpool 21 at Wembley Arsenal went 10 down early in extra time before Eddie Kellys 101stminute equaliser from close range Ten minutes later Charlie George scored the winner from the edge of the penalty area to win the game and the Double for Arsenal

The Double proved to be a premature high point of a decade characterised by a string of nearmisses Despite signing World Cup winner Alan Ball for a club record 220000 in the close season Arsenal began 197172 badly losing three matches in August and were forced to play catchup for the rest of the season ultimately finishing fifth Their debut in the European Cup started encouragingly but they were knocked out in the quarterfinals by a Johann Cruyffinspired Ajax who went on to win the trophy as part of a hattrick of European titles Arsenal also reached the FA Cup Final for the second year in a row in a repeat of the 1968 League Cup Final they lost 10 to Leeds United in an ugly match of few real chances

Arsenal finished as First Division runnersup in 197273 but within a year the Doublewinning side had been broken up and Mee was unable to build a new team in its place The clubs form declined sharply finishing 16th in 197475 and 17th in 197576 their lowest in more than forty years which prompted Mees resignation Tottenham manager Terry Neill a former Arsenal player was appointed in his place even though he had never got Spurs anywhere beyond midtable to become Arsenals youngestever manager

Worst team Arsenal moved back into the top half of the table inspired in part by the emergence of Irish superstar Liam Brady Brady formed part of a large Irish contingent at Highbury which included Pat Rice Frank Stapleton Pat Jennings Sammy Nelson John Devine and the young David OLeary Further to this were experienced signings such as Malcolm Macdonald and Alan Hudson as well as the return of Don Howe who had been part of the backroom staff when the Double was won to the Arsenal coaching setup

Although they could not challenge the League dominance of Liverpool at the time towards the end of the decade they proved their mettle in the FA Cup Arsenal reached three finals in a row 1978 1979 and 1980 but won only one the 1979 final against Manchester United Largely inspired by Brady Arsenal went 20 up through Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton and looked to be coasting to victory with five minutes to go United scored twice in quick succession to level the match Extra time loomed but Alan Sunderland converted Graham Rixs cross in injury time to secure a famous 32 win

The next season 197980 proved to be cruel as Arsenal played a recordbreaking 70 matches and reached two cup finals only to end the season emptyhanded Arsenal were favourites to beat Second Division West Ham United in the FA Cup final but lost 10 to a Trevor Brooking header Meanwhile they had also reached the Cup Winners Cup final against Valencia after Paul Vaessens goal had given them a famous victory over Juventus in the semifinals the final finished goalless and Arsenal lost on penalties with Brady and Rix having their efforts saved

Liam Brady left Arsenal for Juventus in the summer of 1980 and the team entered another barren spell They continued to finish in the top four at the start of the 1980s but never really looked like winning the title and they could not rediscover their FA Cup form either  aside from 198283 when Arsenal reached both cup semifinals in only to be knocked out in both by Manchester United Neill struggled to control his team at times throughout his tenure he had fallingsout with many of his players including Hudson and Macdonald and he was unable to contain the drinking culture within the squad His signings to replace the departed Brady and Stapleton failed to make the same impact and towards the end of Neills reign the club suffered several embarrassing cup defeats this included losing to parttimers KFC Winterslag in the 198182 UEFA Cup and Third Division Walsall in the 198384 League Cup Neill was sacked in December 1983 soon after the latter result

Don Howe Neills assistant succeeded him but he could not get the side anywhere near a trophy either Although Arsenal managed to finish sixth and seventh under him they never seriously challenged for the title although they did briefly top the league in October 1984 and were dumped out of the 198485 FA Cup by Third Division York City The fans were getting increasingly disillusioned with the clubs muddling performances and attendances started to dip beneath 20000 In March 1986 after hearing the board had approached FC Barcelona coach Terry Venables as his replacement Howe resigned Steve Burtenshaw was briefly caretaker manager but the club decided to look to outside for Howes longterm successor

The Arsenal board of directors did contact Scottish club Aberdeen with a view to offering the job to their manager Alex Ferguson while also drawing up an offer to Millwall manager George Graham to become assistant manager of Arsenal but Ferguson rejected the offer However Ferguson did cross the border six months later to succeed Ron Atkinson at Manchester United

In May 1986 Millwall manager George Graham a former Arsenal player was appointed as Howes longterm replacement and it was the beginning of a new era of success at Highbury Graham gradually sold off most of the older players and replaced them with new signings and players promoted from the youth team while imposing much stricter discipline than his predecessors both in the dressing room and on the pitch Arsenals form immediately improved so much so that the club were top of the League at Christmas 1986

Players like Kenny Sansom Steve Williams Tommy Caton Charlie Nicholas and Gus Caesar were gradually discarded and a newlook Arsenal side featured players including Lee Dixon Nigel Winterburn Steve Bould David Rocastle Alan Smith and Paul Merson

Though Arsenal finished fourth in Grahams first season in charge having led the First Division for most of the winter Arsenal did win the League Cup in a campaign marked by comebacks Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semifinals after losing 10 at Highbury in the first leg and conceding a second goal in the first half of the second leg at White Hart Lane Arsenal scored twice through Viv Anderson and Niall Quinn to draw 22 on aggregate and force a replay in the replay Spurs went 10 up only for Arsenal to come back again with late goals from Ian Allinson and David Rocastle to win The final against Liverpool was a repeat performance after Arsenal had gone 10 down to an Ian Rush goal two Charlie Nicholas goals brought Arsenal their first League Cup triumph and their first major trophy for eight years However UEFA voted to continue the ban on English clubs in European competitions that was imposed in the wake of the Heysel disaster in 1985 for a third season and this meant that Arsenal were unable to compete in the 198788 UEFA Cup

While Arsenal lost the League Cup final the following year in a shock 32 defeat to Luton Town and dipped to sixth place in the league their League form steadily improved afterwards thanks largely to a revamped defence which consisted of Lee Dixon Nigel Winterburn Steve Bould and Tony Adams which formed the basis of Arsenals successes for a decade or more Until he left in 1993 longserving defender David OLeary remained an important member of the squad who frequently appeared as a substitute and filled in whenever the younger members of the back four were unavailable However during this time Grahams Arsenal were not a purely defensive side Graham also employed capable midfielders such as David Rocastle Michael Thomas and Paul Merson and striker Alan Smith whose prolific goalscoring regularly brought him more than 20 goals in most of the eight seasons he spent at the club

In Grahams third season 198889 the club won the Football League Centenary Trophy before winning their first League title since 1971 in highly dramatic fashion Having led the League since Christmas Arsenal were overtaken by Liverpool after losing to Derby County and drawing at home to Wimbledon in May Arsenal had seemingly thrown away the title but the final game of the season on 26 May was against Liverpool at Anfield Arsenal needed to win by two goals to take the title Liverpool had already won the FA Cup and were favourites to complete the Double Alan Smith scored for Arsenal early in the second half to make it 10 but as time ticked by Arsenal struggled to get a second and with 90 minutes gone on the clock Arsenal still needed another goal and it looked as though the league title would be staying at Anfield But with only seconds to go a Smith flickon found Michael Thomas surging through the Liverpool defence the young midfielder lifted the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar and into the net giving Arsenal the title

Arsenal did not retain the title the following season they finished fourth in 198990 and fell behind champions Liverpool runnersup Aston Villa and thirdplaced Tottenham Hotspur in the title challenge They also failed to make their mark in the cups and the postHeysel ban on English clubs in European competition was still in force at that time so Arsenal were unable to represent England in the European Cup The ban was lifted at the end of the season though Liverpool the team present at the Heysel disaster had to serve an extra year

Graham prepared for another title challenge by signing goalkeeper David Seaman and Swedish winger Anders Limpar in the summer of 1990 both players proved vital as Arsenal retook the title in 199091 despite two major setbacks Arsenal had two points deducted in November 1990 after ten of their players were involved in a brawl with Manchester United players in a match at Old Trafford and captain Tony Adams was sentenced to four months imprisonment for drink driving just before Christmas Despite these setbacks Arsenal lost only one league match all season and finished seven points clear of Liverpool at the end of what had for most of the season been a twohorse race for the title They also reached the FA Cup semifinals where they faced Tottenham Hotspur Paul Gascoigne scored with a free kick from 30 yards after just five minutes and Tottenham ran home 31 winners dashing hopes of a unique second Double

In September 1991 Arsenal paid a club record of 25million for Crystal Palace striker Ian Wright who would go on to spend seven years at the club and become their alltime leading goalscorer in the process The 199192 season saw the clubs first entry in the European Cup for 20 years The European venture went badly Arsenal were knocked out by Benfica in the second round and failed to make the lucrative group stage The season went from bad to worse when the Gunners were knocked out of the FA Cup by lowly Wrexham though Arsenal recovered to finish fourth in the League The ban on English clubs in European competitions had been lifted two years earlier but Arsenal missed out on a UEFA Cup place as English clubs were gradually being phased back into European competitions and at this stage only the second and third placed teams were qualifying for the UEFA Cup

During the 1992 close season the club acquired Danish midfielder John Jensen who had just won Euro 92 with Denmark scoring a goal in their victory over Germany in the final Jensens arrival coincided with the departure of fellow midfielder David Rocastle to Leeds United the defending league champions Around this point Graham altered his tactics he became more defensive and turned out far less attackminded sides which depended mainly on goals from Wright rather than the whole team Between 198687 and 199192 Arsenal averaged 66 League goals a season scoring 81 in 199192 but between 199293 and 199495 they only averaged 48 this included just 40 in 199293 when the club finished 10th in the inaugural season of the FA Premier League scoring fewer than any other team in the division though they had briefly topped the table in November

They were founder members of the FA Premier League on its launch for the 199293 season They lost their first ever Premiership game 42 after taking a 20 lead over underdogs Norwich City at Highbury Norwich among the preseason relegation favourites were actively involved in the title race and finished third whereas Arsenal among the preseason title favourites finished 10th

Arsenals form in the cups was much better than in the league and in 199293 they became the first side to win the FA Cup and League Cup double In the League Cup final Arsenal faced Sheffield Wednesday a Mersoninspired Arsenal side came from 10 down to win 21 thanks to a Steve Morrow goal In the FA Cup Arsenal beat Spurs 10 in the semifinals avenging their defeat of 1991 and played Sheffield Wednesday in the final just as they had done in the League Cup final a few weeks earlier The game ended 11 and went to a replay Wright opened the scoring for Arsenal but Chris Waddle equalised Extra time came and still no goal broke the deadlock until the 120th minute when Andy Linighan powered home a header from a corner to win the match and the cup double for Arsenal

In 199394 Arsenal won their second European trophy a side missing key players John Jensen and Martin Keown were injured while Ian Wright was suspended beat favourites and holders Parma 10 in the Cup Winners Cup final in Copenhagen with a tight defensive performance and Alan Smiths 21stminute goal from a left foot volley The 1994 Cup Winners Cup proved to be George Grahams last trophy at the club the following February the Scot was sacked after nearly nine years in charge after it was discovered he had accepted an illegal 425000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge following Arsenals 1992 acquisition of John Jensen one of Hauges clients

In the weeks before Graham was sacked he made three major signings for Arsenal Glenn Helder a Dutch winger signed from Vitesse was a regular firstteam player for more than a year after joining the club but was then loaned to Benfica before permanently departing in October 1997 to join NAC Breda back in the Netherlands Chris Kiwomya an attacking midfielder signed from Ipswich Town scored 3 goals in 17 matches before the end of the season but never played for the club again finally departing in 1998 to sign for Queens Park Rangers Nineteenyearold Welsh striker John Hartson was signed from Luton Town and occupied the firstteam place vacated by the injuryhit Alan Smith who retired from playing months later However Hartson was not a regular player the following season and was sold to West Ham United in 1997

George Grahams final season at Arsenal was also the final season at the club for several of the clubs key players Alan Smith one of his first signings was forced into retirement by injury several months later Paul Davis the clubs longestserving player was given a free transfer at the seasons end having found his first team opportunities increasingly limited towards the end of his time at Arsenal Swedish midfielder Stefan Schwarz was sold to Fiorentina that summer after just one season at Highbury Striker Kevin Campbell who had struggled to establish himself as a regular player in spite of some impressive performances over five seasons was sold to Nottingham Forest Winger Jimmy Carter who had failed to establish himself as a regular player in four seasons at Arsenal was sold to Portsmouth

Assistant manager Stewart Houston took charge until the end of the 199495 season Arsenal finished 12th in the Premier League However they did reach the Cup Winners Cup final again after a titanic semifinal against Sampdoria which they won on penalties after drawing 55 on aggregate Arsenal faced Real Zaragoza in the final Esnider scored for the Spaniards and John Hartson equalised for Arsenal The game was heading to a 11 draw and penalties before midfielder Nayim struck from 40 yards in the 120th minute in virtually the last kick of the game David Seaman who had been Arsenals hero in the semifinal shootout could not backpedal fast enough and only got a hand to the ball as it went in

In June 1995 Arsenal appointed Bruce Rioch who had just guided Bolton Wanderers to the League Cup final and promotion to the top flight as manager He briefly broke the English transfer record by paying Internazionale 75million for Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp and the new signing formed an impressive partnership with Ian Wright Arsenal reached the League Cup semifinals and finished fifth in the Premiership at the end of 199596 securing a place in the following seasons UEFA Cup and giving hope for an eventual title challenge However the Rioch era ended abruptly in August 1996 just before the start of the new season Rioch was sacked after a dispute over transfer funds with the board of directors triggering a couple of months turmoil at the club Stewart Houston was once again put in temporary charge he remained at the helm for a month before resigning to take over at QPR Youth team coach Pat Rice held the fort for several games before making way for the Frenchman Arsne Wenger at the end of September

The team immediately improved under Wengers management coming third and winning a UEFA Cup place in 199697 missing out on second and a Champions League spot on goal difference Wenger rebuilt the Arsenal squad with a crop of French players who were largely unknown in the UK Patrick Vieira had been signed on Wengers recommendation before he had officially taken up the reins and Wenger added Nicolas Anelka and Emmanuel Petit as well as Dutch winger Marc Overmars in the summer of 1997 Wenger melded the new arrivals with some of the old guard retaining Adams Dixon Winterburn Keown and Bould and he kept Pat Rice on as assistant manager

Wenger got his first silverware and became the first foreign manager to win the English league the following season when he steered the side to their second double It had looked like Arsenal were out of the title race by December after losing 31 at home to Blackburn but they overcame a twelvepoint deficit to overtake Manchester United a 40 home win over Everton on 3 May won the title with two matches to spare On 16 May Arsenal beat Newcastle United 20 in the FA Cup final to complete the double To top it off the same season Ian Wright broke Cliff Bastins goalscoring record bringing his tally to 185 goals before leaving the club in the summer of 1998

Despite the signing of Freddie Ljungberg in 1998 and Thierry Henry a year later a more barren period followed for Arsenal over the next few years though they came close several times Arsenal led the League for much of 199899 until a 10 loss to Leeds United allowed Manchester United to overtake them Arsenal beat Aston Villa on the last day of the season but Uniteds victory over Spurs meant they took the title To rub it in further Arsenal also lost the last ever FA Cup semifinal replay to Manchester United Dennis Bergkamp had missed a penalty in normal time and Ryan Giggs scored the winner in extra time after a mazy solo run through the Arsenal defence Arsenals return to the Champions League for the first time in seven years was also unsuccessful as they failed to get past the group stage

Arsenal came second again in 19992000 this time there was never any real title race and Arsenal finished the season 18 points behind winners Manchester United Arsenal had another poor season in the Champions League finishing third in their group this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal got all the way to the final where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen the scene of their 1994 Cup Winners Cup triumph The match was a tepid affair a 00 draw with few chances it went to penalties and Arsenal lost after Davor uker and Patrick Vieira missed their spotkicks

Arsenal again finished second in 200001 this time ten points behind Manchester United the title race had been as good as over since February when Arsenal lost 61 at Old Trafford Arsenals season gave priority to the Cups and Europe They beat Spurs in the semifinals and met Liverpool in the final at the Millennium Stadium Cardiff Arsenal dominated most of the match and were denied a goal by the arm of defender Stphane Henchoz which went unpunished Arsenal finally did go 10 up through Ljungberg but succumbed to two late Michael Owen goals and lost 21 In Europe Arsenal made it to the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time since 1972 only to be eliminated on the away goals rule by eventual finalists Valencia

By now Wenger had been forced to rebuild much of the Doublewinning side of 1998 Anelka Overmars and Petit had all left for Spanish clubs in return for hefty fees while age was finally catching up with the famous back line Bould and Winterburn had already left and Adams and Dixon would only last another season before retiring In their place Wenger signed the likes of Sol Campbell and Lauren in defence as well as promoting Ashley Cole from the youth ranks In midfield Wenger added the talismanic Robert Pires and signed his compatriot Sylvain Wiltord in attack while in the meantime Thierry Henry had adapted to the English game to become one of the Premierships best strikers

Attack was definitely Arsenals fort as they won a recordequalling third Double in 200102 season the Gunners were the only team to score in every game of the Premiership season and went unbeaten in domestic away games After an initially tight title race just three points separated the top four in February Arsenal pulled away from the pack with a 13game winning streak finishing seven points ahead of runnersup Liverpool Arsenal secured the title in the penultimate match of the season with a 10 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford the goal coming from Wiltord The previous weekend Arsenal had wrapped up their eighth FA Cup beating Chelsea 20 with goals from Ray Parlour and Freddie Ljungberg

In 200203 Arsenal became the first club in more than 20 years to retain the FA Cup with a 10 victory against Southampton thanks to a Pires goal Their joy was soured by the fact that they narrowly missed out on retaining the Premiership title Arsenal had led eventual winners Manchester United by eight points at one stage but their form collapsed late on in the season they drew 22 away to Bolton Wanderers after leading 20 and then lost 32 at home to Leeds United a week later which gave United the title

Little did they know it at the time but the defeat to Leeds would be Arsenals last in the League for over a year 200304 was a recordbreaking season for Arsenal as they won the Premiership unbeaten 26 wins 12 draws 0 defeats finishing a clear 11 points ahead of secondplace Chelsea They became only the second team to do so the first having been Preston North End in 188889 Their rivals for the title gained revenge in other competitions  Arsenal were defeated in the Champions League quarterfinals and FA Cup semifinals by Chelsea and Manchester United respectively in successive matches Faced with the potential collapse of their season Arsenal recovered from being 10 and 21 behind to Liverpool in their next league match to win 42 thanks to a Thierry Henry hattrick and went on to win the league with a 22 draw away to Tottenham Hotspur mimicking their success in 1971

Arsenal were unable to retain the title in 200405 finishing second 12 points behind a recordbreaking Chelsea side However the Gunners did stretch their unbeaten run to 49 consecutive matches an English league football record the record was equalled with a dramatic 53 win over Middlesbrough Arsenal having trailed 31 shortly after halftime and then surpassed with a 30 win over Blackburn Rovers in August 2004 before their unbeaten season was ended with a 20 away defeat by Manchester United This defeat arguably upset the teams form and they fell away from title contention before recovering with a late flourish to finish second sealed with a 70 drubbing of Everton Champions League glory eluded them again with the club getting knocked out 32 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the second round Arsenal did not end the season emptyhanded they came away with their third FA Cup in four years winning 54 on penalties after a 00 draw where they played ten versus eleven against Manchester United

Weakened by the sale of captain Patrick Vieira to Juventus in the summer of 2005 Arsenals 200506 season was comparatively disappointing domestically and the club failed to challenge for any trophies at home In the league their poor away form dogged them and despite recording some impressive wins at home 50 over Aston Villa and 70 over Middlesbrough Arsenal spent much of the latter stages of the season in fifth place or lower and looked set to miss out on the Champions League for the first time since 1997 However they won their last three matches of the season culminating in a 42 victory over Wigan Athletic in the last ever match at Highbury coupled with Tottenham Hotspurs loss at West Ham the same day this meant Arsenal pipped Spurs to fourth place and a Champions League spot

In contrast to their domestic form Arsenals form in Europe in 200506 was much stronger they reached the UEFA Champions League final for the first time in their history becoming the first London club ever to do so Arsenal finished top of their group unbeaten above Ajax Thun and Sparta Prague against whom Thierry Henry scored two goals on away to become the alltime record goalscorer for Arsenal in the knockout stages they beat Real Madrid becoming the first British team to beat Madrid at the Santiago Bernabu Stadium Juventus and then Villarreal to reach the final setting a competition record of ten matches without conceding a goal in the process In the final against Barcelona Arsenal were reduced to ten men early on when goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off for a professional foul nevertheless they were the ones who scored first Sol Campbell scoring with a header from a free kick in the 37th minute Arsenal desperately defended their lead but two late goals from Samuel Etoo and Juliano Belletti meant Barcelona ran out 21 winners

Arsenal have been highly successful in the 1990s and 2000s but Highburys capacity was limited to only 38500 in the postTaylor report era virtually every match was sold out and the club were unable to maximise matchday revenue With expansion of Highbury ruled impossible in 1999 Arsenal announced plans to move to nearby Ashburton Grove construction started in December 2002 with the demolition of buildings on the site and in July 2006 the new Emirates Stadium opened ready for the start of the 200607 season

Arsenal took a little time to get used to their new surroundings and as early as November manager Arsne Wenger conceded that his side was unlikely to make a serious challenge for the title Dogged by poor away form throughout the season Arsenal eventually finished fourth level on points with thirdplaced Liverpool With a team largely filled with reserve and younger players they reached the League Cup Final which they lost 21 to Chelsea They were less successful in other competitions however being knocked out early on in both the Champions League and FA Cup

200607 marked a transitional period  Arsenal had sold a string of key players including Ashley Cole Sol Campbell Lauren Freddie Ljungberg and most significantly alltime top scorer and club captain Thierry Henry to Barcelona Arsenal went into 200708 season with only four players from the titlewinning season in 200304 with the likes of Cesc Fbregas and Gal Clichy establishing their places in the side

Arsenal started the season strongly going undefeated until early December and in the process setting a club record of 28 matches unbeaten in all competitions The young squad continued to impress into the new year with Emmanuel Adebayor in excellent scoring form But Eduardo a player of growing importance to the club suffered a horrific injury at St Andrews in Birmingham City and the game subsequently ended 22 The team were rocked and inevitably Arsenal slumped in the spring eventually finishing third They had little success in the cups knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpool in the quarterfinals and the FA Cup by Manchester United The League Cup was more fruitful where Arsenal reached the semifinals for a third season in a row before being knocked out 62 on aggregate by Tottenham Hotspur their first defeat in a North London derby in almost nine years

Arsenals 200809 season started well reaching top of the table by late September After that the team lost momentum with three defeats in November and had dropped out of the top four by Christmas despite victories over Manchester United and Chelsea Arsenal continued to drop points in the league in the New Year but eventually overtook Aston Villa to regain fourth place by midMarch eventually finishing nine points clear Arsenal also reached the semifinals of the FA Cup losing to Chelsea 21 in their first game at the new Wembley Stadium In Europe they finished second in their group and beat Roma and Villarreal before losing 41 on aggregate to Manchester United in the semifinals

Despite being written off by much of the media going into the 200910 season Arsenal made a bright start in the Premier League aided by a new attacking formation and added defensive steel in the form of holding midfielder Alex Song of Cameroon and new signing Thomas Vermaelen of Belgium Arsenals title challenge looked set to end in late November following losses to Chelsea Manchester United and Manchester City but an impressive run of games in December aided by Chelsea and Manchester United both dropping points restored momentum to Arsenals title challenge going into 2010 In December Arsenal were eliminated from the League Cup at the quarterfinal stage by Manchester City

After being written out of the title race once in the 200910 Premier League season by pundits Arsenal headed into a tough period of matches from 27 January through 10 February in which they faced Aston Villa Manchester United Chelsea and Liverpool all in a row After losing to Stoke City in the FA Cup 31 Arsenal drew Aston Villa 00 got thrashed 31 at home by Manchester United and lost at Chelsea 20 At the time it left Arsenal nine points behind league leaders Chelsea Again Arsenal were written off in their title hopes only for it to be resurrected once again after Chelsea lost to Everton 21 Manchester City 42 and drew with Blackburn Rovers 11 Meanwhile Manchester United also dropped points drawing with Aston Villa 11 and also losing to Everton 31 Following Arsenals 20 loss to Chelsea on 7 February Arsenal went on a good run winning all of their league games up to 20 March However on 27 February a major injury to Welsh midfielder Aaron Ramsey occurred it was eerily reminiscent of Eduardos injury against Birmingham City on 23 February However whereas Arsenal drew against Birmingham that year 22 following a penalty call against Gal Clichy in injury time in which James McFadden converted the penalty and left thencaptain William Gallas kicking at an advertisement board and in tears and questioned Arsenals fragile team mentality Arsenal managed to rally against Stoke 31 having scored a penalty from captain Cesc Fbregas in the 90th minute and defender Thomas Vermaelen scoring a third in injury time As of 25 March Arsenal are in third place with 67 points two points behind league leaders Manchester United with 31 games played

Arsenals Champions League match against Porto in the first leg went poorly Played at the Estdio do Drago in Porto on 17 February 2010 the first goal was scored by Porto in the 11th minute of the match standin goalkeeper ukasz Fabiaski for the injured Manuel Almunia pushed a cross from Silvestre Varela into his own net resulting in a quick 10 lead for Porto However in the 18th minute Sol Campbell making his first Champions League appearance for Arsenal since the 2006 Champions League final scored a header from Vermaelens headed flick and Tom Rosicks headed setup from a corner delivered by Fbregas This gave Arsenal a possibly vital away goal However the match got worse for Arsenal as miscommunication by Campbell and Fabiaski led to the goalkeeper picking up what was judged a deliberate back pass to the goal keeper inside the 18yard box As a result the referee gave a freekick to Porto inside Arsenals penalty area Rben Micael took the resulting quick freekick directly catching the Arsenal defence and goalkeeper offguard and squared a pass to Radamel Falcao who easily scored The game match 21 for Porto

Arsenals second leg against Porto fared much better Played at the Emirates Stadium on 9 March Arsenal needed at least one goal and a clean sheet to advance with the aggregate score 21 for Porto and away aggregate 10 for Arsenal The match began brightly for Arsenal as Nicklas Bendtner scored in the 10th and 25th minute before Samir Nasri scored a fantastic goal in the 66th minute dribbling past three defenders on the far right side touchline before scoring from an acute angle hitting the goalkeepers right post and into the net Three minutes later Emmanuel Ebou scored on a counterattack dribbling past goalkeeper Helton before tucking the ball into an empty net The night ended with Bendtner scoring a penalty in the 90th minute thus giving him his first senior professional hattrick and Arsenal advancing to the quarterfinals of the Champions League 62 on aggregate Bendtner had missed a number of easy chances the match before Porto against Burnley However Arsenal managed to win 31 in that match

On 19 March 2010 Arsenal drew Barcelona in the Champions League quarterfinals The first of the twolegged match was played on 31 March at Arsenals Emirates Stadium it marked Thierry Henrys return to the Emirates for the first time as an opponent of Arsenal The second leg was played on 6 April at the Camp Nou and marked Cesc Fbregas return to the Catalan giants where he played in their youth squad If Arsenal prevailed past Barcelona they would face the winner of the CSKA MoscowInternazionale match In their first leg match at Emirates Arsenal drew 22 with Bara with goals from Theo Walcott and captain Fbregas The second leg at the Camp Nou did not go as well despite Bendtner scoring early on Lionel Messi scored an four goals to end the match at an aggregate score of 63 for Barcelona eliminating Arsenal from the Champions League

Arsenal finished the Premier League season in third place their 15th successive topfive finish and the 13th successive season they had achieved qualification for the Champions League It was also their fifth successive trophyless season however something of a disappointment considering this trophyless spell was preceded by five trophy winning seasons from a possible eight including two seasons where they won the double

201011 saw Arsenal perform well in the Premier League and compete strongly in a title challenge alongside Manchester United To prove such a challenge they faced struggling champions Chelsea on 27 December and mauled them 31 at Emirates Good form continued in the following months and in February manager Arsne Wenger was awarded Manager of the Month Award Notable events in this month was the 21 win over Barcelona in which the team came from behind to seal a win and the 44 draw against Newcastle United that is widely regarded to be one of the most bizarre and great games of the Premier League era They progressed to the final of the League Cup but were beaten 21 by Birmingham City squandering their chances of winning a trophy After this embarrassment the Gunners travelled to the Camp Nou to play the second leg of the Bara tie where they were beaten by the threetime winners and eventual victors Arsenals FA Cup run ended with defeat in the quarterfinals to Manchester United Also completing a miserable couple of weeks for the Gunners their title hopes were ended when they lost 21 to Bolton Wanderers away in April 2011 After challenging for the title for the majority of the season Arsenal ended up finishing fourth after losses at Stoke and Aston Villa Arsenal had failed to win a single trophy for the seventh consecutive year
The 201112 campaign commenced for Arsenal on 13 August 2011 against Newcastle in the midst of two major transfer sagas concerning the clubs biggest assets Cesc Fbregas and Samir Nasri both departed Arsenal The game finished 00 and neither of the said players were in the named squad but new signing Gervinho was sent off for violent conduct However the team did muster a 10 win over Italian outit Udinese in the first leg of a Champions League playoff

On 15 August 2011 Fbregas left for Barcelona for an estimated 35million In addition to his loss Nasri left for Manchester City on 24 August 2011 ending a protracted transfer saga after playing for Arsenal in their match against Liverpool on 21 August in which Arsenal lost 20 placing them 14th with one draw and one loss However they managed to gain qualification for the Champions League for the upcoming year for the 14th time the only other English Club to boast such a record in recent years is Manchester United With mounting injury problems and suspensions the season was already looking bleak for Arsenal and this was epitomized by an 82 mauling in the hands of Manchester United Following their collapse early in the season Arsenal were already written off as title challengers with some fans suggesting Arsenals longstanding manager Arsne Wenger be sacked

After the disappointing result against Manchester United Arsenal went on a spending spree on the last day of the transfer window purchasing Per Mertesacker Mikel Arteta Andr Santos and Yossi Benayoun Results began to improve with a win over newly promoted Swansea City before a Champions League away draw against Borussia Dortmund Winning in the League Cup against Shrewsbury Town in the Premier League against Bolton and in the Champions League against Olympiacos boosted morale around the club and Arsenal began climbing the league table after spending a time in the bottom quarter of the table

Despite losing the first North London Derby of the season against Tottenham Arsenal continued to gain points and as of 23 October 2011 were in seventh place in the Premier League In week that followed Arsenal managed to extend their good form by beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge 35 with a hattrick from captain Robin van Persie

December 2011 saw the announcement of the possible comeback of Thierry Henry Arsenals alltime best player and goalscorer to whom a statue was built to the club and the following month it was confirmed that he had rejoined the Gunners from the New York Red Bulls on a twomonth loan deal coinciding with the Major League Soccer MLS offseason On 9 January 2012 Henry marked his return to Arsenal with his second debut at the Emirates against Leeds United in the third round of the FA Cup Furthermore he scored the winning goal  his 227th overall for Arsenal  after coming on as a substitute and collecting a long through from Alex Song It was a moment that sent Arsenal fans into raptures and Henry gave them even more to cheer about when he produced another winner to give Arsenal a 21 victory in a Premier League match against Sunderland However the Gunners suffered a shocking 40 loss to Milan in the Champions League in what would eventually be Henrys final match with the club creating what proved to be an insurmountable obstacle for the club to overturn Arsenal were also eliminated from the FA Cup in the fifth round again against Sunderland losing 20

In spite of these failures Arsenal tried to turn the 201112 season into a positive one almost eliminating Milan by winning 30 at the Emirates Stadium and winning 52 in the second North London Derby of the season against Spurs Arsenal remained third in the Premier League table while not mathematically assured of a place in the 201213 UEFA Champions League due to Chelseas continued participation in the Champions League with three weeks to go before the end of the 201112 Premier League season Manchester City eventually won the league again after three decades their first Premiership title

The beginning of 201213 season saw rumours about the possible departure of star player Robin van Persie since on 4 July 2012 he announced he would not renew his contract with the club To this situation Arsne Wenger signed strikers Olivier Giroud from Montpellier and Lukas Podolski from 1 FC Kln When Van Persies transfer to rivals Manchester United was effective Wenger also purchased Spanish winger Santi Cazorla from Mlaga Arsenal were eliminated in the round of 16 of the 2013 UEFA Champions League 33 on away goals against eventual champions Bayern Munich

Despite being knocked out of the Champions League Arsenal had a very strong finish to their domestic campaign After losing the North London Derby 21 to Tottenham on 3 March Arsenal collected 26 points over their remaining ten games including a 11 draw with Manchester United on 28 April and relegating the newly crowned FA Cup winners Wigan Athletic with a 41 victory on 14 May Arsenal secured fourth place in the Premier League and a Champions League qualifying spot with a 10 win over Newcastle However with the win came some controversy at halftime in the TottenhamSunderland game It was wrongly reported that Newcastle had tied the game Much to the dismay of Tottenham supporters despite their win against Sunderland Arsenal still finished above them

The 2013 offseason was quite tumultuous for Arsenal supporters Before the start of the transfer window many of the clubs youth players were sold or left the club Previous Arsenal record transfer fee holder Andrey Arshavin went back to Russian club Zenit Saint Petersburg and Denlson to So Paulo and Sbastien Squillaci were some of the bigger name players to leave on free transfers Despite the clubs promised ambitions to make big signings Arsenal had only captured the signature of 20yearold Frenchman Yaya Sanogo from Auxerre

Halfway through the summer transfer season the club had a protracted saga with possible signing of Liverpool striker Luis Surez The club believed that a bid above 40million would trigger a release clause but this information proved incorrect and Surez remained under contract with Liverpool In the chase for Surez the club was also thought to be close to signing Gonzalo Higuan from Real Madrid but the striker instead signed for Napoli

With the 201314 Premier League season on the horizon Arsenal sold Ivorian striker Gervinho to Roma for an estimated 85million and goalkeeper Vito Mannone to Sunderland for an estimated 25million On transfer deadline day German international midfielder Mesut zil was transferred to Arsenal from Real Madrid for a clubrecord fee In a twist of fate Real elected to sell zil to create the opportunity they needed to sign star forward Gareth Bale from Tottenham the Gunners longtime rivals During the January transfer Arsenal also acquired the services of Kim Kllstrm from Spartak Moscow until the end of the season

At the end of the 201314 season the team finished the Premier League in fourth place Having beaten defending champions Wigan Athletic in the semifinals Arsenal made it to the 2014 FA Cup Final and took on Hull City on 17 May 2014 Coming back from 20 down after just eight minutes the Gunners levelled the score at 22 by the end of 90 minutes with goals from Santi Cazorla and Laurent Koscielny in either half In the second period of extra time Aaron Ramsey scored the deciding goal in the 109th minute to seal the win and Arsenals first major trophy in nine years

During the transfer window that coincided with the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil Wenger brought in David Ospina Colombia and Mathieu Debuchy France after seeing their performances while a pundit for French TV during the tournament and also added young English defender Calum Chambers from Southampton His most important signing however proved to be Alexis Snchez who also impressed during the tournament with Chile and who Barcelona was letting let leave in order to save money for the transfer of Luis Surez from Liverpool

In the Community Shield match against the 2014 Premier League champions Manchester City Arsenal convincingly won 30 for their second trophy within three months Santi Cazorla Aaron Ramsey and substitute Olivier Giroud scored the goals in the traditional opening game of the English football season

In the 201415 Premier League after a hardfought 21 comeback win where Aaron Ramsey scored in the final minute of the first game against Crystal Palace two away draws at Everton and Leicester City in August plus right back Bacary Sagnas earlier move to Manchester City fans wanted another signing Arsenal managed to sign Danny Welbeck from Manchester United on deadline day while Wenger officiated at a Peace Game hosted by Pope Francis Arsenal remained undefeated for the first six games until they lost 20 at Chelsea on 5 October They went on to finish third in the league and won the FA Cup for the second year in a row after a 40 trouncing of Aston Villa in the final at Wembley thanks to goals by Theo Walcott Alexis Snchez from distance Per Mertesacker and Olivier Giroud respectively This qualified them for their second successive Community Shield this time against Chelsea and the Gunners retained the Shield thanks to Alex OxladeChamberlains firsthalf strike This match was the debut of new goalkeeper Petr ech who had coincidentally arrived from Chelsea after having won the Premier League FA Cup and Champions League with the Blues and the Czech managed to keep a clean sheet against his former club It was also the first time that Wenger had beaten a team managed by Jos Mourinho his 14th attempt while finishing third in the league

For the following season Arsenal gradually progressed upon their league form eventually becoming runnersup in 2016 In order to capture that everelusive Premier League title for the first time in 12 years the club spent heavily in the transfer market in the summer of 2016 spending over 80 million on four firstteam acquisitions namely capturing Shkodran Mustafi and Granit Xhaka who operate as a central defender and central midfielder respectively Both positions were long deemed problem positions in the team with the hope Arsenal could push on and win the league after signing the pair However poor league form saw Arsenal competing heavily for the final UEFA Champions League space having taken a race with Liverpool and Manchester City to the final day of the season Despite winning 31 against Everton results elsewhere meant they only finished fifth missing out on a Champions League spot for the first time in two decades and the first ever under Wenger However Arsenal won the FA Cup Final 21 against Chelsea making it their third win in four seasons and made them the most successful club in the history of the competition

In order to rebuild the squad after a disappointing league campaign and to prepare for the clubs first in the UEFA Europa League Arsenal used the following offseason to sign strongman leftback Sead Kolainac from Schalke 04 while also purchasing striker Alexandre Lacazette for a clubrecord 465 million The two players made their debuts in the 2017 FA Community Shield against league champions Chelsea where Kolainac scored to send the game to a penalty shootout Arsenal scored all four of their penalties to claim their 15th Shield and their sixth trophy in five seasons The club parted ways with seventeen players including firstteam stalwart Alex OxladeChamberlain to Liverpool for a record sale fee of 40 million The club however began the 201718 campaign poorly failing to register an away win until December After outcry from fans about the clubs inabilities on the pitch Arsenal went and appointed backroom trio Sven Mslintat Ral Sanllehi and Huss Farhmy to act as head scout head of footballing relations and contract negotiator respectively in order to address the clubs shortcomings

Following the trios appointments Arsenal produced a more aggressive stance in the following transfer market allowing disgruntled star Alexis Snchez depart to Manchester United in a swapdeal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan who was a player Arsenal had chased in the past The club also allowed squadfillers Francis Coquelin Mathieu Debuchy and Theo Walcott to leave while brokering a deal to allow for the departure of Olivier Giroud a noble servant to the club for Chelsea This was done after Arsenal were able to acquire the signing of PierreEmerick Aubameyang one of the most coveted forwards in Europe for a new clubrecord fee of 56 million These additions were enough to bring Arsenal to the final of the 201718 EFL Cup although losing to rampant Manchester City 30 Arsenal would then go on their worst losing streak since 2002 losing four consecutive games in all competitions The club also lost five out of seven league games by March 2018 scoring 12 and conceding 15 When factoring in all competitions the club conceded an additional two while registering only one more This meant Arsenal conceded on average over twice a game

Presenilin
Presenilins are a family of related multipass transmembrane proteins which constitute the catalytic subunits of the gammasecretase intramembrane protease complex They were first identified in screens for mutations causing early onset forms of familial Alzheimers Disease by Peter St GeorgeHyslop at the Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases at the University of Toronto and now also at the University of Cambridge Vertebrates have two presenilin genes called PSEN1 located on chromosome 14 in humans that encodes presenilin 1 PS1 and PSEN2 on chromosome 1 in humans that codes for presenilin 2 PS2 Both genes show conservation between species with little difference between rat and human presenilins The nematode worm C elegans has two genes that resemble the presenilins and appear to be functionally similar sel12 and hop1

Presenilins undergo cleavage in an alpha helical region of one of the cytoplasmic loops to produce a large Nterminal and a smaller Cterminal fragment that together form part of the functional protein Cleavage of presenilin 1 can be prevented by a mutation that causes the loss of exon 9 and results in loss of function Presenilins play a key role in the modulation of intracellular Ca involved in presynaptic neurotransmitter release and longterm potentiation induction

The structure of presenilin1 is still controversial although recent research has produced a more widely accepted model When first discovered the PSEN1 gene was subjected to hydrophobicity analysis that predicted that the protein would contain ten transmembrane domains All previous models agreed that the first six putative membranespanning regions cross the membrane These regions correspond to the Nterminal fragment of PS1 but the structure of the Cterminal fragment was disputed A recent paper by Spasic et al provides strong evidence of a nine transmembrane structure with cleavage and assembly into the gammasecretase complex prior to insertion into the plasma membrane However because this is a protein with large numbers of hydrophobic regions it is unlikely that xray crystallography will provide definitive proof of the structure

The structure of the presenilin1 Cterminal catalytic fragment was determined using solution NMR It is made up of alpha helices and is 176 amino acids in length It was found that Alzheimers patients carry mutations in the presenilin proteins PSEN1 PSEN2

Most cases of Alzheimers disease are not hereditary However there is a small subset of cases that have an earlier age of onset and have a strong genetic element In patients suffering from Alzheimers disease autosomal dominant hereditary mutations in the presenilin proteins PSEN1 PSEN2 or the amyloid precursor protein APP can be found The majority of these cases carry mutant presenilin genes An important part of the disease process in Alzheimers disease is the accumulation of Amyloid beta A protein To form A APP must be cut by two enzymes beta secretases and gamma secretase Presenilin is the subcomponent of gamma secretase that is responsible for the cutting of APP

Gamma secretase can cut APP at several points within a small region of the protein which results in A of various lengths The lengths associated with Alzheimers disease are 40 and 42 amino acids long A 42 is more likely to aggregate to form plaques in the brain than A 40 Presenilin mutations lead to an increase in the ratio of A 42 produced compared to A 40 although the total quantity of A produced remains constant This can come about by various effects of the mutations upon gamma secretase Presenilins are also implicated in the processing of notch an important developmental protein Mice that have the PS1 gene knocked out die early in development from developmental abnormalities similar to those found when notch is disrupted

The genes for the presenilins were found through linkage studies using mutations present in familial Alzheimers cases in 1995

The genetic inactivation of presenilins in hippocampal synapses has shown this selectively affects the longterm potentiation caused by theta with the inactivation in presynapse but not the postsynapse impairing shortterm plasticity and synaptic facilitation The release of glutamate was also reduced in presynaptic terminals by processes that involve modulation of intracellular Ca release This has been suggested to represent a general convergent mechanism leading to neurodegeneration

Juliet Shaw
Juliet Shaw is a fictional character in the British TV show Spooks portrayed by British actress Anna Chancellor She rose fast as a spy achieving the position of National Security Coordinator at the Cabinet Office She worked with Harry Pearce on a number of operations during the 1970s

Pearce describes her as ruthless rightwing and crazy wholl stop at nothing to protect Britain She is driven and singleminded with a takenoprisoners attitude which some find highly attractive She cares little for the impact of her words and will often talk bluntly rather than in a roundabout way

She was left apparently paralysed from the waist down by a car bomb attack on the Home Secretary Nicholas Blake in Series 5 Episode 1 during a chain of terrorist attacks and reappeared later in the series in a wheelchair Shaw may harbour a grudge against Ros Myers since it was her father Sir Jocelyn Myers who organised the chain of attacks that ultimately led to the car bomb and her paralysis However she reappears in series 6 as a highranking Yalta operative  stating that she had been working with the organisation under deep cover  freely walking around and apparently unparalysed

In the same episode that she is revealed as a member of Yalta she is the person who kills Ros Myers by injecting her with what she thought was a lethal nerve agent Believing Myers to be dead Shaw escaped to fight another day however unbeknownst to her Adam Carter had switched the syringes and so Myers was merely put into a deathlike state until her funeral where Carter helped her escape into anonymity

Flowerclass sloop
The Flower class comprised five subclasses of sloops built under the Emergency War Programme for the Royal Navy during World War I all of which were named after various flowers They were popularly known as the herbaceous borders in humorous reference to a wellknown adage about the Royal Navy Britains best bulwarks are her wooden walls as well as to a type of garden border popular in the United Kingdom

The Flowers were designed to be built at merchant shipyards to ease the pressure on yards specializing in warships The initial three groups were the first purposebuilt fleet minesweepers built with triple hulls at the bow to give extra protection against loss from mine damage when working When submarine attacks on British merchant ships became a serious menace after 1916 the existing Flowerclass minesweepers were transferred to convoy escort duty and fitted with depth charges as well as 47inch naval guns


Gentian and Myrle were both lost to mines in the Baltic Sea on 2 July 1919

The latter two groups the Aubrietias and Anchusas were designed as submarine decoys or Qships with hidden guns and a distinctive merchant marine appearance These warshipQs were thus the first purposebuilt antisubmarine fighting ships and their successor types were the antisubmarine sloops of World War II  which evolved into the modern antisubmarine warfare frigate during the 193945 Battle of the Atlantic


Some 112 Flowerclass vessel in total were built for the Royal Navy and a further eight for the French Marine Militaire Of these 17 British and one French Flowers were sunk

Some members of the class served as patrol vessels throughout the world during the peacetime years between the wars but almost all were disposed of by World War II This allowed the majority of the class names to be revived for the new smaller s

Two members of the final Anchusa group and Saxifrage renamed President in 1922 survived to be moored on the River Thames for use as drill ships by the RNVR until 1988 a total of seventy years in Royal Navy service Chrysanthemum was sold to private owners and scrapped in 1995 President was sold and preserved and is now one of the last three surviving warships of the Royal Navy built during the First World War along with the 1914 light cruiser in Belfast and the 1915 monitor in Portsmouth dockyard

St Louis Public Library
The St Louis Public Library is a municipal public library system in the city of St Louis Missouri It operates sixteen locations including the main Central Library location Although similarly named the St Louis Public Library is unrelated to the St Louis County Library system

In 1865 Ira Divoll the superintendent of the St Louis Public School system created a subscription library in the public school library that would later evolve into the St Louis Public Library Divoll believed that library should work in tandem with the public education system and offer citizens an opportunity for selfimprovement and culture

By 1869 Divolls the subscription library moved to the Board of Education building The library consisted of 4 staff members who offered reference services 12 hours a day The library also encouraged children to visit the library and had no age restrictions like most libraries of the day

Due to rapid growth of the library collection which grew from 1500 volumes in 1865 to 90000 volumes by 1893 the library required more space In 1893 the library moved into a new space on the top floors of the new Board of Education building Also in 1893 the citizens of St Louis voted to move the administration of the Library to an independent board supported by a property tax This vote enabled to library to offer a library free of subscription fees and be open to all St Louis residents

The Library occupied the board of education building from 1893 until 1909 as construction on Central Library was being completed This buildings size wasnt large enough to accommodate the librarys growing collection It was during this time the library began its role as a lending library allowing the public to check out and take books home

In 1901 Andrew Carnegie made a large donation which was used for expansion including the building which is the currently central library By this time the collection included 90000 books By 1938 the collection included 900000 items and by 2014 4600000 items 

The St Louis Public Library operates 17 libraries including the main Central Library Branches include Baden Barr Buder Cabanne Carondelet Carpenter Central Express Charing Cross Compton Julia Davis Divoll Kingshighway Machacek Marketplace Schlafly and Walnut Park In addition to the Central Library building Barr Cabanne Carpenter and Carondelet branch buildings were Carnegie libraries

The Central Library building at 13th and Olive was built in 1912 on a location formerly occupied by the St Louis Exposition and Music Hall and was designed by Cass Gilbert The main library for the citys public library system has an oval central pavilion surrounded by four light courts The outer facades of the freestanding building are of lightly rusticated Maine granite The Olive Street front is disposed like a colossal arcade with contrasting marble basrelief panels A projecting threebay central block like a pareddown triumphal arch provides a monumental entrance At the rear the Central Library faces a sunken garden The interiors feature some lighttransmitting glass floors The ceiling of the Periodicals Room is modified from Michelangelos ceiling in the Laurentian Library Renovation and expansion of the building began in 2010 and finished in 2012

Tajiks of Xinjiang
Chinese Tajiks or Mountain Tajiks in China Sarikoli  Tujik  including Sarikolis majority and Wakhis minority in China are an extension of the Pamiri ethnic group that lives in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the Peoples Republic of China They are one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the government of China

Despite the name by which they are known in China the Tajiks of Xinjiang are not the same as the Tajik people who speak the Tajik language The Tajiks in Xinjiang of China are an extension of the Pamiri people a different Iranian group who speak the indigenous Eastern Iranian Pamiri languages

Tashkurgan Town became the capital of the Sarikol kingdom  a kingdom of the Pamir Mountains

During the Qing dynasty the Tajiks were administered by a system of Begs like the rest of Xinjiang During the Qing dynasty the Chinese claimed suzerainty over the Taghdumbash Pamir in the south west of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County but permitted the Mir of Hunza to administer the region in return for a tribute

The Tajiks of Xinjiang practiced slavery selling some of their own as a punishment Submissive slaves were given wives and settled with the Tajiks They were considered property and could be sold anytime Their slaves came from numerous sources enslaving Sunni captives such as Kirghiz in retaliation for Kirghiz slave raids against the Tajiks since the Kirghiz sold them into slavery in these raids or from Kunjud Gilgit Chitral Slaves from Chitral and Kunjud passed through there to Bukhara The Sunnis called them Rafidites and did not consider them Muslim

Most foreign slaves in Xinjiang were Shia Mountain Tajiks they were referred to by Sunni Turkic Muslims as Ghalcha Shia Mountain Tajik Ghalchas made up the majority of slave trafficked and sold in Xinjiang to the Sunni Muslim Turkic inhabitants and they were seen as foreigners and strangers Serfs were treated in a wretched manner

An antiRussian uproar broke out when Russian customs officials 3 Cossacks and a Russian courier invited local Turki Muslim Uyghur prostitutes to a party in January 1902 in Kashgar this caused a massive brawl by the inflamed local Turki Muslim populace against the Russians on the pretense of protecting Muslim women because there was antiRussian sentiment being built up even though morality was not strict in Kashgar the local Turki Muslims violently clashed with the Russians before they were dispersed the Chinese sought an end to tensions to prevent the Russians from building up a pretext to invade

After the riot the Russians sent troops to Sarikol in Tashkurghan and demanded that the Sarikol postal services be placed under Russian supervision the locals of Sarikol believed that the Russians would seize the entire district from the Chinese and send more soldiers even after the Russians tried to negotiate with the Begs of Sarikol and sway them to their side they failed since the Sarikoli officials and authorities demanded in a petition to the Amban of Yarkand that they be evacuated to Yarkand to avoid being harassed by the Russians and objected to the Russian presence in Sarikol the Sarikolis did not believe the Russian claim that they would leave them alone and only involved themselves in the mail service

In the 1940s around 9000 Tajiks lived in Xinjiang

During the Ili Rebellion Uyghur forces butchered the livestock of the Tajiks as they advanced south The Soviet backed insurgents destroyed Tajik crops and acted aggressively against the Tajiks and Kirghiz of China

The population of Tajiks in China numbers 41028 2000 They are located in Chinas western Xinjiang region with 60 living in Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County Despite the name Tajik that is used to refer to them the Tajiks of China do not speak the Tajik language Early 20thcentury travelers to the region referred to them as Sarikoli Mountain Tajiks or Ghalcha

In China the languages of the Tajik people have no official written form The great majority speak the Sarikoli language which has been heavily influenced by Uyghur Chinese and Wakhi A small proportion speak Wakhi language Sarikoli and Wakhi are Iranian languages commonly classified in the Pamir or Eastern Iranian areal groups

The Mountain Tajiks in China are adherents of the Aga Khani Nizari Ismaili sect of Shia Islam and are still a little isolated from the rest of the worldwide Ismaili community though their communication with other Pamiri Ismaili peoples has never stopped The Chinese authorities allow a few Ismaili religious buildings to function in Xinjiangs Tajik Autonomous District whose clerics were appointed by the Chinese secular authorities Restrictions by the Chinese government bars foreign Ismaili preachers from openly working among the Tajiks in China and the religious leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect the Aga Khan was once barred from business with the Chinas Ismailis But recently the Aga Khan has begun to communicate with China more

From 24 April 2012 His Highness the Aga Khan Aga Khan IV paid an official visit to rmqi China at the invitation of the Governor of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Mr Nur Bekri to discuss collaboration between the Aga Khan Development Network AKDN and the autonomous government of Xinjiang His Highness and Governor Bekri held constructive talks in the meeting and agreed to collaborate in several thematic areas of mutual interest including poverty alleviation education tourism investment and financial services The Aga Khan IV had last visited China in 1981

Klinkhammer
The Klinkhammer is a popular emerger used in fly fishing to catch grayling and trout It is most popular within Europe but has a growing interest in North America

The Klinkhamer originally named LT Caddis light tan now officially named Klinkhmer Special was devised by a Dutch angler Hans van Klinken in the early 80s to imitate an emerging caddisfly to catch grayling and trout which feed from them as they float in the surface film This pattern has proven to be an extremely effective fly

Klinkhamers are different from many other parachute dry flies in that the thorax of the fly is designed to hang down through the surface of the water to imitate an emerging insect

The abdomen serves as a trigger point which penetrates the surface film which gets noticed by trout from great distances even before any resulting surface footprint features

In all variations of this fly the abdomen of the fly float is underneath the surface of the water to attract the fish and improve hookups while the parachute hackle and foam or wing is on or above the surface of the water for visibility and flotation

Arnold Krug
Arnold Krug October 16 1849 in Hamburg  August 14 1904 in Hamburg was a German composer and music teacher Gustav Jenner was among his many students

He began his music studies with piano lessons from his father Diederich Krug who was himself a pianist and composer Later he was sent to the Leipzig Conservatory where he studied with Carl Reinecke and then went on to Berlin where continued with Friedrich Kiel and Eduard Franck After completing his studies he taught in Berlin at the Stern conservatory for several years before returning to Hamburg where he remained for the rest of his life working primarily as a music teacher and choral director

While he wrote works in several different genres including symphonies orchestral overtures operas piano works and chamber music it is his choral works which received the most attention However today he is primarily remembered for his String Sextet in D Major Op 68

This string sextet was known as the Prize Sextet because Krug won the Stelzner Prize for chamber music with this composition The Prize Sextet was originally for 2 Violins Viola Violotta Cello and Cellone but the publisher of the work Fritz Kistner wisely hedged his bets and produced an edition for the standard combination of 2 Violins 2 Violas and 2 Cellos in addition to the socalled Stelzner version Of this work Wilhelm Altmann the famous chamber music critic has written
If not a masterpiece of the highest order from start to finish Krugs Sextet nonetheless comes away with high honors He uses his themes skillfully and his sonorities are quite successful The first movement Allegro begins with a short but powerful introduction which gives the impression of storms ahead Instead the main melody is quite genial and broad Later Krug cleverly weaves the introduction into the second theme and uses it as part of the coda The second movement Adagio tranquillo is characterized by a calm deeply felt melody which is interrupted by an urgent and highly dramatic middle section There is no scherzo but the lively first theme to the finale Allegro seems to fill this gap A quieter and more lyrical second theme provides excellent contrast

1994 Ukrainian parliamentary election
Parliamentary elections were held in Ukraine on 27 March 1994 with a second round between 2 and 10 April 15 political parties gained seats and the majority of deputies were independents However 112 seats were remained unfilled and a succession of byelections were required in July August November and December 1994 and more in December 1995 and April 1996 Three hundred 300 seats or two thirds 23 of the parliament were required to be filled for the next convocation

In what were the first elections held after Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union the Communist Party of Ukraine emerged as the largest party in the Verkhovna Rada winning 86 of the 338 seats decided in the first two rounds This election was the result of a compromise between the President and the Verkhovna Rada which was reached on 24 September 1993 because of a political crisis caused by mass protests and strikes particularly from students and miners On that day the Rada adopted a decree to organize parliamentary elections ahead of schedule and ahead of scheduled presidential elections in June

As in the previous this election took place according to the majoritarian electoral system in 450 electoral districts containing several precincts Each region was assigned a proportion of districts depending on its population Hence the most mandates were received by the more populated eastern regions of Ukraine particularly the regions of Donets basin such as Donetsk Oblast and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast

In order to be elected a candidate needed to obtain more than 50 of votes and in order for the election to be valid more than 50 of registered voters needed to vote If no candidate obtained more than 50 in the first round the top two candidates were listed on the ballot in the second round In the second round the 50 rule was applied as well Reelections were called in case if the 50 votes in the second round was not met

Because of those conditions several districts in the Verkhovna Rada were left not represented for a whole convocation Particularly acute that problem was in the city of Kiev that was assigned 23 mandates while in the parliament only its 10 representatives participated in the second convocation  less than a half Kiev became the most under represented region

Blocs were formed in the Rada on 11 May 1994

The political blocks formed in the Verkhovna Rada did not exactly represented a similar party Such parties as the Peasants Party of Ukraine SelPU and the Agrarians for Reform AZR a breakaway SelPU members formed the Agrarians of Ukraine block Although some of the deputies especially from SelPU joined the Socialist block The Ukrainian Republican Party URP the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists CUN and the Democratic Party of Ukraine DemPU has formed the electoral block Derzhavnist Statehood


In February 1997 the following factions were present in parliament























































Due to the low turnout 112 seats remained vacant and later in the summer of 1994 24 and 31 July and 7 August 20 MPs were elected to the Rada On 20 November and 4 December nine more MPs were elected

On 30 May 1994 MP Roman Kuper died of a heart attack and Leonid Kravchuk was elected as his replacement on 25 September On 15 July Leonid Kuchma surrendered his parliamentarian mandate after being elected President and Vasyl Yevrukhov was elected in his place On 21 August MP Vitaliy Yurkovsky died and was replaced by Natalya Vitrenko

Spalliera
A spalliera Plural spalliere is a decorated backboard mounted on a wall often behind a cassone a wooden chest used for storage or as a headboard to a bed It is usually made out of wood and embellished with decorative aspects such as intricate carving or painting and is gilded as well They were common in Renaissance Tuscany 

No examples of Florentine sets of spalliere with inset paintings have survived intact At the most expensive level all four walls of a room seem to have had panels fitted which were richly decorated with carved wood marquetry and sometimes paintings inset into the wood These paintings were usually much wider than tall like the painted panels on cassoni They seem often to have been made to celebrate a wedding and fitted to the marital bedroom though other important rooms also had them 

Sandro Botticelli and Piero di Cosimo are two of the better known painters who produced many paintings whose wide format suggests that this was their original function they have now been given conventional picture frames

Bailey was born in Camden New Jersey At the age of 15 Bailey became a student at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Art in Philadelphia A year later one of his drawings of flowers was accepted for the annual exhibition of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where he later studied In addition to these schools he also had the chance to study at Royal College of Art London Academie de lecluse and Acadmie Bilouil Paris France Deciding that he wanted to see great events and make pictures of them he joined the art staff of The Philadelphia Times in 1892 and two years later went to The Boston Herald He found plenty of action for his pencil in the life of the citycrime court trials fires and shipwrecksand in the political conventions of 1900

From 18921901 he was a staff artist on the Philadelphia Times and the Boston Herald to later contribute to Scribners Harpers The Century Everybodys and other leading The Harpers Weekly Leslies Weekly and Colliers Throughout this experience he had to travel extensively In 1902 he represented the Boston Herald as special artist at the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in London Then in 1907 he visited Paris London Italy and Germany as a special staff artist for Harpers Magazine Upon the entry of the United States into World War I in 1917 Bailey was the first artist authorized to make drawings of navy yards gun shops and munition plants  The drawings that he did were later published and exhibited in art museums widely and won Bailey the Official Thanks of Josephus Daniel the former Secretary of the Navy  These drawings were later acquired by the Smithsonian Institution and a set of prints was installed in the French War Museum Paris 

After this expedition Bailey traveled extensively throughout Spain He completed his tour in 1921 after traveling cities and small towns all over the country capturing the landscapes and scenes in watercolors and drawings In 1925 he did another Spanish tour and later this collection of 150 drawings was turned into a published book Little Known Towns of Spain This book received a great amount of attention in addition to the royal decree of thanks from King Alphonso XIII of Spain Within the book was the following writeup

At a meeting in Paris of Agnacio Zuloaga and Vernon Howe Bailey Senor Zuloga having highly complimented Mr Bailey on his work in Spain said But when I saw your book of watercolors and drawings of Spain I was angry with you for you have disclosed to the world the names of Spanish towns of which I hoped it would never learn for the tourists will spoil them and gone will be their true character and the life and the old costumes I have loved to paint will have vanished Within fifteen years Spain will have been spoiled for me

A record field of 64 finalists assembled to battle for Phil Taylors world crown Play was not held between 22 December and Christmas Day due to the Christmas break Play resumed on Boxing Day in the leadup to the final A days break was also held on New Years Eve for the New Year Record prize money of 100000 for the winner was in offer

Despite the record field there was a notable absentee John Lowes world ranking had fallen to a level which meant he was forced to qualify for the event  which he failed to do for the first time in his career His run of 28 successive appearances including the BDO World Championship had come to an end He was the last player to have appeared in a world championship each year since it began in 1978 Bob Anderson who made his debut in 1984 now had the longest unbroken run  making his 23rd consecutive appearance for these championships

A major shock came in the first round when world number one and top seed Colin Lloyd lost to Gary Welding  it was only the second time in the history of the PDC World Championship that the top seed fell in the first round Peter Manley being the first in 2001 Welding who had recovered from two sets down in his bestoffivesets match against Lloyd went on to reach the quarterfinals

Phil Taylor became World Champion for the 13th time this being his 11th PDC success His toughest battle en route to the championship was a tight semifinal against Wayne Mardle which he managed to win by 6 sets to 5 The final was a more onesided affair as Taylor overcame Peter Manley 70 It was Manleys third final defeat against Taylor and the second time he was whitewashed mirroring the result of the 2002 final

Mesosphere mantle
In geology the mesosphere refers to the part of the Earths mantle below the lithosphere and the asthenosphere but above the outer core The upper boundary is defined by the sharp increase in seismic wave velocities and density at a depth of  At a depth of 660km ringwoodite gammaMgFeSiO decomposes into MgSi perovskite and magnesiowstite This reaction marks the boundary between upper mantle and lower mantle This measurement is estimated from seismic data and highpressure laboratory experiments

The base of the mesosphere includes the D zone which lies just above the coremantle boundary at approximately  The base of the lower mantle is at about 2700km

Mesosphere not to be confused with mesosphere a layer of the atmosphere is derived from mesospheric shell coined by Reginald Aldworth Daly a Harvard University geology professor In the preplate tectonics era Daly 1940 inferred that the outer Earth consisted of three spherical layers lithosphere including the crust asthenosphere and mesospheric shell Dalys hypothetical depths to the lithosphereasthenosphere boundary ranged from  and the top of the mesospheric shell base of the asthenosphere were from  Thus Dalys asthenosphere was inferred to be thick According to Daly the base of the solid Earth mesosphere could extend to the base of the mantle and thus to the top of the core The term mesosphere has largely been replaced by the term lower mantle in the scientific literature

A derivative term mesoplates was introduced as a heuristic based on a combination of mesosphere and plate for postulated reference frames in which mantle hotspots apparently exist

Denver Seminary
Denver Seminary is an accredited graduatelevel institution based in Littleton Colorado with extension campuses in Washington DC and West Texas It offers Master of Arts Master of Divinity Doctor of Ministry and Master of Theology degrees with numerous specialized concentrations and has enrollment of about 900 students It is known for its emphasis on training and mentoring as an integral aspect to seminary education Denver Seminary adheres to the National Association of Evangelicals Statement of Faith

The evangelical theological stance of Denver Seminary is captured by the words of the late chancellor Vernon Grounds

Here is no unanchored liberalism freedom to think without commitment Here is no encrusted dogmatism commitment without freedom to think Here is a vibrant evangelicalism commitment with freedom to think within the limits laid down in Scripture

This statement was first used by Grounds to stake out Denver Seminarys theological position in the midst of conflict between moderately conservative and ultraconservative factions of the Conservative Baptist Association that eventually led the ultraconservative faction to withdraw from the CBA and found the Conservative Baptist Fellowship CBF Grounds formerly the academic dean of fundamentalist Baptist seminary in New York state affiliated with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches eventually became a key spokesperson for the evangelical movement that attributes its roots to the writings of Carl F H Henry Under his leadership Denver Seminary became firmly rooted in this theological camp

Today Denver Seminary is a nondenominational evangelical seminary that still holds to this statement by chancellor Vernon Grounds

Denver Seminary was founded in 1950 by members of the newly founded Conservative Baptist Association This is a group of churches that separated from the Northern Baptist Convention over theological differences stemming from the FundamentalistModernist Controversy conflict earlier in the twentieth century The school was originally known as the Conservative Baptist Theological Seminary and in 1982 changed its name to Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary The school changed its name again in 1998 to Denver Seminary to reflect its growing appeal to a widespectrum of evangelical students Students are required to sign the statement of faith used by the National Association of Evangelicals

Richard Asher
Richard Alan John Asher FRCP 3 April 1912  25 April 1969 was an eminent British endocrinologist and haematologist As the senior physician responsible for the mental observation ward at the Central Middlesex Hospital he described and named Munchausen syndrome in a 1951 article in The Lancet

Richard Asher was born to the Reverend Felix Asher and his wife Louise ne Stern He married Margaret Augusta Eliot at St Pancras Church London on 27 July 1943 whereupon his fatherinlaw gave him a complete set of the Oxford English Dictionary which doctor and medical ethicist Maurice Pappworth alleged was the source of Ashers accidental reputation as a medical etymologist They had three children Peter Asher born 1944 a member of the pop duo Peter  Gordon and later record producer Jane Asher born 1946 a film and TV actress and novelist and Clare Asher born 1948 a radio actress

The Asher family home above his private consulting rooms at 57 Wimpole Street was briefly notable when Paul McCartney lived there in 196466 during his relationship with Jane Asher

In 1964 Asher suddenly gave up his hospital post and perhaps all medical activities He suffered from depression in later life and reportedly died by his own hand at the age of 57

Asher was regarded as one of the foremost medical thinkers of our times who emphasised the need to be increasingly critical of our own and other peoples thinking Asher was particularly concerned that many clinical notions are accepted because they are comforting rather than because there is any evidence to support them

Asher was hailed as a pioneer in challenging the value of excessive bed rest following treatment and argued that the PelEbstein fever a fever characteristic for Hodgkins disease was an example of a condition that exists only because it has a name Ashers 1949 paper Myxoedematous Madness alerted a generation of physicians to the interaction between the brain and the thyroid gland As a result young and elderly psychiatric patients are now screened for thyroid malfunction Some of the madness cases are now thought to be the early descriptions of Hashimotos encephalopathy a rare neuroendocrine syndrome sometimes presenting with psychosis

Asher is remembered today mostly for his refreshingly provoking articles which sparkle with sequinshis own aphorisms imaginary dialogue fantasies quotations He thought that medical writing should provide useful understandable and practical knowledge instead of allotovwords2obscure4any12succidinunderstandingthem Anthologies of his articles were wellreceived with the Talking Sense collection being described as still the best advice on medical writing Notable articles include

The Seven Sins of Medicine is a lecture delivered by Asher and later published in The Lancet describing medical professional behaviour that is considered inappropriate These sins are often quoted to students

From 19952010 an annual prize 2010 value 1200 in memory of Asher was awarded by the Royal Society of Medicine and the Society of Authors for the best first edition textbook aimed at undergraduate students The most recent prize was presented to Hugo Farne Edward NorrisCervetto and James WarbrickSmith for their book Oxford Cases in Medicine and Surgery at the Royal Society of Medicine 27 October 2010

<doc id="7732659" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732659" title="Nested quotation">
Nested quotation
A nested quotation is a quotation that is encapsulated inside another quotation forming a hierarchy with multiple levels When focusing on a certain quotation one must interpret it within its scope Nested quotation can be used in literature as in nested narration speech and computer science as in metastatements that refer to other statements as strings Nested quotation can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each quotation level is put into perspective

In languages that allow for nested quotes and use quotation mark punctuation to indicate direct speech hierarchical quotation sublevels are usually punctuated by alternating between primary quotation marks and secondary quotation marks For a comprehensive analysis of the major quotation mark systems employed in major writing systems see Quotation mark

Nested quotes often become an issue using the eval keyword The eval function is a function that converts and interprets a string as actual JavaScript code and runs that code If that string is specified as a literal then the code must be written as a quote itself and escaped accordingly

For example
This code declares a variable a which is assigned the value 3 and a blank alert window is popped up to the user

Suppose we had to make a quote inside the quoted interpreted code In JavaScript you can only have one unescaped quote sublevel which has to be the alternate of the toplevel quote If the 2ndlevel quote symbol is the same as the firstlevel symbol these quotes must be escaped For example
Furthermore unlike in the literature example the thirdlevel nested quote must be escaped in order not to conflict with either the first or secondlevel quote delimiters This is true regardless of alternatingsymbol encapsulation Every level after the third level must be recursively escaped for all the levels of quotes in which it is contained This includes the escape character itself the backslash  which is escaped by itself 

For every sublevel in which a backslash is contained it must be escaped for the level above it and then all the backslashes used to escape that backslash as well as the original backslash must be escaped and so on and so forth for every level that is ascended This is to avoid ambiguity and confusion in escaping

Here are some examples that demonstrate some of the above principles
Note that the number of backslashes increase from 0 to 1 to 3 to 7 to 15 indicating a 2n1 rule for successively nested symbols

Marcinkus
Marcinkus is a oneman play by American author Tom Flannery based on the life of Roman Catholic Archbishop Paul Marcinkus

The play had its debut in WilkesBarre Pennsylvania in July 2006 at the Arts YOUniverse center for the applied and living arts The production was under the direction of Paul Winarski and starred Greg Korin as the Archbishop After several revisions by the director and author the play was remounted in Scranton in February 2007 at the Old Brick Theatre It is a oneman dramatization of events in the life of Catholic Archbishop Paul Marcinkus whose shady tenure as head of the Vatican Bank included suspicions of money laundering Ponzi schemes and even assassination
The original production while well receivedunderwent several script revisions by the author and director in order to streamline the piece The revised version which opened in Scranton ran 15 minutes shorter and is now considered the final version of the play

A Las Vegas production of the play is also in the planning with original star Greg Korin

The play takes place in a small office in what may be purgatory but looks very much like the archbishops office in Sun City Arizona his last residence as a retired man of the cloth
Marcinkus relates directly to the audience stories from his youth growing up in Al Capones Chicago and how he eventually became a priest As the piece unfolds he tell his version of the Vatican Bank Scandal his appointment as head of the bank the death of Pope John Paul I and his job as bulldog to Pope John Paul II Although dramatic the piece is lightened by the humor that Flannery has instilled in his version of Marcinkus who was popularly quoted as saying You cant run the church on Hail Marys 

The niece of Archbishop Marcinkus afraid that the play would be a hatchet job on her uncle contacted playwright Flannery who sent her a copy of the text Not only did she agree that the play was a balanced look at her uncles life but even offered a few suggestions which the author included in his rewrite

<doc id="7732687" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7732687" title="Sullivan principles">
Sullivan principles
The Sullivan principles are the names of two corporate codes of conduct developed by the AfricanAmerican preacher Rev Leon Sullivan promoting corporate social responsibility

In 1977 Rev Leon Sullivan an AfricanAmerican minister was a member of the board of General Motors At the time General Motors was one of the largest corporations in the United States General Motors also happened to be the largest employer of blacks in South Africa a country which was pursuing a harsh program of statesanctioned racial segregation and discrimination targeted primarily at the countrys black population

Sullivan looking back on his antiApartheid efforts recalled

Starting with the work place I tightened the screws step by step and raised the bar step by step Eventually I got to the point where I said that companies must practice corporate civil disobedience against the laws and I threatened South Africa and said in two years Mandela must be freed apartheid must end and blacks must vote or else Ill bring every American company I can out of South Africa

The Sullivan principles introduced in 1977 with one addition in 1984 consisted of seven requirements a corporation was to demand for its employees as a condition for doing business In general the principles demanded the equal treatment of employees regardless of their race both within and outside of the workplace demands which directly conflicted with the official South African policies of racial segregation and unequal rights

The principles read
The Sullivan principles were celebrated when introduced and gained wide use in the United States particularly during the disinvestment campaign of the 1980s Before the end of South Africas apartheid era the principles were formally adopted by more than 125 US corporations that had operations in South Africa Of those companies that formally adopted the principles at least 100 completely withdrew their existing operations from South Africa

However as South Africas system of apartheid persisted relatively unchanged from the 1970s into the late 1980s Sullivan abandoned his principles as not going far enough complaining that the principles by themselves were not enough to pressure a South African government steadfast in its refusal to yield to change

In 1999 more than 20 years after the adoption of the original Sullivan Principles and six years after the end of apartheid the Rev Leon Sullivan and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan together unveiled the new Global Sullivan Principles

The overarching objective of these principles according to Leon Sullivan is to support economic social and political justice by companies where they do business including respect for human rights and equal work opportunities for all peoples

In general the expanded corporate code of conduct requires adopting multinational companies to be a full participant in the advancement of human rights and social justice internationally

Three seconds rule
The three seconds rule also referred to as the threesecond rule or three in the key often termed a lane violation requires that in basketball a player shall not remain in the opponents restricted area for more than three consecutive seconds while that players team is in control of a live ball in the frontcourt and the game clock is running The countdown starts when one foot enters the restricted area and resets when both feet leave the area

The threesecond rule was introduced in 1936 and was expressed as such no offensive player with or without the ball could remain in the key for three seconds or more

The threesecond rule came about in part following a game at Madison Square Garden between the University of Kentucky UK and New York University NYU in 1935 won by NYU 2322 The University of Kentucky team did not take their own referee a common practice at the time despite advice to the UK coach Adolph Rupp from Notre Dame coach George Keogan who had lost to NYU the week prior and who warned Rupp of the discrepancies in officiating between the Midwest and the East The game was rough UK was unable to run its normal offense which consisted of using screens without being called for a foul NYUs Irving Terjesen and Irwin Klein combined to guard one of UKs major players Leroy Edwards allowing him to score a mere 6 points the lowest output of his career The New York Post reacted with alarm The score says that NYU is the best college basketball team in the country and that the East still is supreme But if Frank Lane the referee from the Midwest had worked the game its safe to assume big Leroy Edwards would have been given a fantastic number of foul shots Minor mayhem was committed on the person of Edwards by Terjesen and Klein Something will have to be done or the game will become entirely too rough

Giovanni Paolo Maggini
Giovanni Paolo Maggini c 1580  c 1630 was a luthier born in Botticino Brescia Italy Maggini was a pupil of the most important violin maker of the Brescian school Gasparo da Sal

Magginis early instruments are now considered very desirable because despite their apparent naive craftsmanship they are wonderful instruments They first tended to be modified copies of his teachers instruments But once established on his own around the year 1606 Maggini developed his skills and experimented with his designs until he achieved a level of expertise that is still highly regarded His violas like these of his master are regarded as the best in the world for the rich deep sound and power of tone

The only known pupil of Maggini is Valentino Siani who worked with him c 16101620 before he moved to Florence and started his own business

Maggini succumbed to the Italian plague of 162931 that also took another important early luthier Girolamo Amati This fact arouses suspicions that some of Magginis later works are perhaps creations from a different maker since tests reveal that some instruments bearing a genuine Maggini label are from trees living after Magginis death

The National Music Museum has two Maggini instruments in its collection One is a bass viola da gamba The other is a violin

The 18thcentury European violin virtuosocomposer Ivan Mane Jarnovi played a Maggini violin

A genuine Maggini violin ranges in value from 200000 to 2000000

Ferrari F60
The Ferrari F60 is a Formula One motor racing car which Scuderia Ferrari used to compete in the 2009 Formula One season The car was unveiled on 12 January 2009

The F60 the 55th singleseater car produced by Ferrari to compete in Formula One was named F60 to celebrate the fact that 2009 is Ferraris 60th year in Formula One the only team to have competed every year It was first launched online on 12 January 2009 and Felipe Massa undertook the debut run of the car with a shakedown at Mugello later that day The car was initially intended to debut at Ferraris home Fiorano track but the venue was changed due to poor weather conditions at Maranello

The F60s first full test took place at the Mugello Circuit during the week of 19 January 2009

On average the Ferrari F60 is 19 seconds faster than the last car despite the new regulations In the 2009 season FIA banned the large bargeboards in front of the radiator and the sidepods It also placed limits on the wheelbase making it shorter simpler front splitter narrower rear spoiler and certain underside air flows so that it is less disruptive to the car behind The Ferrari F60 responded to all of this by improving tiny details from the F2008 The front splitter is located further away from the front wheel and now has only 1 layer Ferrari claims this improves air flow to the wheels The F60 is only fitted with 1tread slick tires and a simpler suspension positioned a bit backward in angle Ferrari removed the large airflow plates and replaced it with a small one also adjusting some underside air flow The side mirrors are located at the edge of the cars floor The FIAs ban on small side wings led to the creation of a cleaner sidepods acceptable of the smaller engine and a smooth underside of the chassis The rear diffuser is revised to meet the regulations that stated it has to produce less downforce

The F60 scored its first points in Bahrain the fourth race of the season Kimi Rikknen finished sixth gaining three points for Ferrari Felipe Massa had an accident in the Hungarian Grand Prix involving a spring from Rubens Barrichellos Brawn GP car falling off and striking him on his helmet He did not start the race and for the rest of the season he was replaced by Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer and exForce India driver Giancarlo Fisichella

In early August 2009 Ferrari announced that they had stopped developing the F60 in order to concentrate on the car

The F60 won its first and only race of 2009 at the hands of Rikknen at the Belgian Grand Prix after starting 6th on the grid They eventually finished fourth in the constructors standings just behind McLaren and making 2009 the worst season for Ferrari since 1993 Rikknen was Ferraris highest points scoring driver in 2009 finishing sixth in the standings with 48 points one adrift of fifthplaced Lewis Hamilton of McLaren

Christian Social Party Germany
The Christian Social Party  CSP was a rightwing political party in the German Empire founded in 1878 by Adolf Stoecker as the Christlichsoziale Arbeiterpartei Christian Social Workers Party The party combined a strong Christian and conservative programme with progressive ideas on labour and tried to provide an alternative for disillusioned Social Democrat voters Part of the Berlin movement it increasingly focused on the Jewish question with a distinct antisemitic attitude

In December 1877 Adolf Stoecker domestic chaplain at the court of Emperor Wilhelm I and board member of the Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union together with the economist Adolph Wagner had founded the Central Association for Social Reform Zentralverein fr Sozialreform dealing with injustice and poverty after the Industrial Revolution The organization was meant to counter the rise of the presumably revolutionary Social Democratic Party and to answer the urging social question on the basis of Protestant religion and monarchism It was constituted as a laborers party on 1 February 1878 The program of the CSP included


In turn Social Democrats like Johann Most led a large conjugation in protesting against the party and its Christianity while the reformist approach repelled social conservative voters In the 1878 elections the party obtained less than 1 of the vote thereby failing to enter the German Reichstag parliament

Upon their defeat the CSP gave up its stance as a workers party and concentrated on petitbourgeois sections of the electorate Although antisemitism was only a minor theme in the early stages of the party the antisemitic message was carried by the socalled Berlin movement Berliner Bewegung of the 1880s which gathered considerable support The party linked anticapitalism with hatred toward Jews denoting both big business and social liberal or socialist movements as Judaized and fulfilling the plans of the world Jewry to exterminate the German people which according to the CSP did not include Jews

The party never gained mass support but Stoecker from 1879 onwards was able to obtain a seat in the Reichstag after an electoral coalition with the German Conservative Party DKP In the parliament he acted as a DKP farright advocating the abolition of universal suffrage and intriguing against the policies of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck until his resignation in 1890 Stoecker was even able to include some antisemitic remarks in the DKPs 1892 party manifesto but when the Conservatives became worried with the overtones in his messages although they were more targeted at Reform Judaism than orthodox Judaism the Christian Socials were forced from the coalition in 1896 and approached to the antisemitic German Social Party In turn a leftwing group around Friedrich Naumann split off to found the NationalSocial Association

The final demise of the Christian Social Party came in the early 1900s Stoecker died in 1909 and in November 1918 most members of the CSP under lead of Reichstag member Reinhard Mumm who succeeded Stoecker in representing the Arnsberg constituency stepped over to the German National Peoples Party Deutschnationale Volkspartei DNVP in 1918 The group separated itself again emerging as the Christian Social Peoples Service ChristlichSoziale Volksdienst in 1929 after the business magnate Alfred Hugenberg had become DNVP chairman

Operation Autumn Clouds  Mivtza Ananei Stav is an Israeli military operation that began on 1 November 2006 following numerous rocket and mortar attacks on southern Israel when the Israeli Defense Forces entered the Gaza Strip triggering sporadic fighting near Beit Hanoun The operation is the largest military endeavor undertaken by the Israeli military since Operation Summer Rains in the summer of 2006 The operation was launched to stop Palestinian rocket attacks into Israel

Palestinian government officials said on 7 November that IDF troops were beginning to withdraw thus ending the operation Fiftythree Palestinians including 16 civilians and an IDF soldier were killed since 31 October

On 1 November 2006 in the largest military operation by Israel since Operation Summer Rains six Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed and 35 people were wounded during a raid on Beit Hanoun by the Israeli military The raid involved three air strikes sixty tanks backed by helicopter gunships The AFP news agency reported that three houses were razed by Israeli bulldozers and a dozen homes were hit by tank shells The raid was the beginning of Operation Autumn Clouds by the Israeli military Both the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the Prime Minister Ismail Haniya have described the raid as a massacre

On 3 November 2006 one Palestinian woman was killed and ten were reported wounded by Israeli military fire The women had gathered outside a mosque in Beit Hanoun after an appeal by the local radio for women to rescue Palestinian militants trapped inside a mosque by disguising the militants as women The Israeli military claimed that their soldiers had spotted two Palestinian militants dressed in womens clothes hiding within the crowd of women and that the militants were using the women as human shields

The Prime Minister of the Palestinian Authority Ismail Haniyeh praised the women whom he said led the protest to break the siege of Beit Hanoun

Palestinian government officials said on 7 November that IDF troops were beginning to withdraw thus ending the operation Fiftythree Palestinians including 16 civilians and an IDF soldier were killed since 31 October

Several civilian houses in Beit Hanoun were struck by shells fired by the Israeli Defense Force At least 19 Palestinian civilians were killed and 40 wounded

One day later Assistant SecretaryGeneral Angela Kane of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs briefed the UN Security Council on the shelling She urged both sides in the conflict to return to dialogue A resolution proposed by Qatar as condemnation of the shelling was brought before the Security Council and was vetoed by the United States with the US ambassador to the UN John Bolton calling the proposed resolution onesided and politically motivated Following this rebuff a watereddown and nonbinding resolution was passed by the UN General Assembly on 17 November 2006 expressing the assemblys distress at the shelling and calling for a factfinding mission to be sent to Gaza The resolution was passed by a majority including the European Union member states Among the several objectors were the United States and Israel

On 16 November Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants firing from Beit Hanoun launched a Qassam rocket at the Israeli town of Sderot killing one and injuring one other Israels Prime Minister released a statement saying This is precisely the type of murderous attacks that we are trying to prevent Israel will take any means necessary in protecting our citizens 

Israel refused to cooperate with the UN Human Rights Council and obstructed any international investigation into the matter A Human Rights Council mandated mission which was to have been led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu was refused to enter Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory On 11 November the United States vetoed a Security Council draft resolution calling for the establishment of a factfinding mission into the events of 8 November in Beit Hanoun 

A UN report written by the Special Rapporteur concluded that it seems clear that the indiscriminate firing of shells into a civilian neighbourhood with no apparent military objective constituted a war crime for which both the commanding officer and those who launched the 30minute artillery attack should be held criminally responsible

Arabisclass sloop
The Arabis class was the third and largest of the five subclasses of minesweeping sloops completed under the Emergency War Programme for the Royal Navy in World War I They were part of the larger Flower Class shipbuilding project which were also referred to as the Cabbage Class or Herbaceous Borders The ships were also used outside their minesweeping duties as patrol vessels tugs and personnel and cargo transports

The design for the Arabis class was made at the end of 1914 All 36 British vessels were ordered in July 1915 and were built in three batches averaging 12 vessels A further 8 vessels were later built in British shipyards for the French Navy The design was highly appealing as most shipyards were capable of building them and construction could be completed in five months

Like the preceding Acacia and Azalea class sloops these were singlescrew Fleet Sweeping Vessels Sloops with triple hulls at the bows to give extra protection against loss when working



Six vessels were ordered in January 1916 and another two in September 1916 all to this design from British shipyards for the French Navy and all were delivered to the French in 1916 or the last pair 1917

SyroMalabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam
The SyroMalabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam is an eparchy of the SyroMalabar Catholic Church in India for Knanaya Catholics The Knanaya are descendants of Syrian Christians of Jewish origin who reportedly migrated to the Malabar coast during the fourth century under the leadership of Nestorian Thomas of Cana During the 17th century they split into Catholic and Malankara Church factions

The Knanaya Hebrew  Malayalam  Syriac  Arabic  also known as Qnanaya Qnai Kanai or Kanahi people are endogamous Jews who settled in Kerala Their origins are uncertain but many scholars believe them to be descended from Yemeni Jews who arrived in the fourth century and were a significant component of the Cochin Jewish population until the 16th century Others believe that they are the descendants of Nestorian Christians with Jewish origins who migrated to the Malabar coast between 431544 AD under the leadership of Thomas of Cana after the Nestorian schism The Knanaya trace their ancestry back as the descendants from the southern Kingdom of Judah the tribes of Judah and Benjamin which did not intermarry Hence they were also known as Tekkumbhagar However recorded texts suggests they were called as Tekkumbhagar much later by the Portuguese to just distinguish the small community from the collective rest of St Thomas Christians per spread area Another variation of history for the name is from pre16thcentury records of the Knanaya community known as Knaithomman Chepped Knaithomman Copper plates in it says the descendants of Thomas of Cana arrived at Kodungallur and stayed in the southern side for Mizrah these plates are the only surviving evidence for their history before the sixteenth century

It is also recorded that the Jewish presence in Kerala was growing after the Bar Kokhba revolt about 132135 at that time Jewish populations of Judea were dead enslaved or in flight Many of the Persian and Arabian Jews fled abroad Jewish colonies were founded on the Malabar Coast and at other well known trading posts

Twenty years or so after the First Council of Nicaea wealthy merchant Thomas of Cana brought a colony of 400 Syrian Christians from 72 families belonging to seven clans Bagi Belkuth Hadai Kujalig Koja Mugmuth and Thegmuth from southern Mesopotamia to the Malabar Coast in 345 and strengthened the church founded by Thomas the Apostle According to Syrian writings the Knanaya migration was a mission from visions of Episcopa Joseph of Uraha with the blessings of Kustathius Patriarch of Antioch

The tradition says descendants of Thomas of Cana lived on the south side for religious purposes and built a city with the locals Mahadevarpattanam as a reminiscent of Jerusalem which means City of the great god Some historians consider them as the Southists The native eighteen families from Paakkanaar lineage who were converted as Knananites Christians and given for regular works by the then ruler Cheraman Perumal stayed on the citys north side and were known as Northists According to another tradition the Jewish Knananites settled on the south side of the Periyar and the native converted Knananites lived on the north side of the river However the first authentic letter that mentions Knanaya community by J M Campori in the 1600s fails to mention this SouthistNorthist division There is also no mention in the history of Saint Thomas Christians of this divisional existence in then Christian community The most accepted version is that Knananaya is known as Southists because they are descended from the southern kingdom of Judah They did not intermarry with native Christians or with the converted Knananites maintaining their KanahiChristian identity with Jewish traditions and remained as an endogamous community However this practice is increasingly unpopular and in the modern ages considered as ill forms of casteism sustained from wrong orientation as a result Knananite factions of Catholic Church and the Syrian Orthodox Church agree of interchurch marriage

There are similarities between the Knanaya Christians and the Cochin Jews with both groups granted 72 privileges by the ruling Cheraman Perumals Copper plates in the Paradesi Synagogue were given to Joseph Rabban a firstcentury Jewish merchant and Thomas of Cana reportedly received similar copper plates during the fourth century Both groups are endogamous The Knananaya believe that their customs are a continuation of Jewish practices such as the bride standing on the grooms right burial of the dead facing Jerusalem the priests black velvet cap the venthanmudy etc During Easter the Knananaya eat unleavened bread and drink wine made from coconut milk and plums reminiscent of the Passover matzot and red wine The Knanaya marriage ceremony includes a bridal canopy similar to the Jewish one and ceremonial bathing on the eve of the wedding may parallel the Jewish mikveh These customs are practiced by the Knanaya distinguishing them from the St Thomas Christians Similarities also exist in the groups ancient songs with references to the 72 privileges found in songs of both communities The songs of both groups are divided into five categories historical bridal biblical invocational and miscellaneous In songs shared by both groups three kings fought bravely and fell when Kodungallur was burned in 1524 and the descendants of Cheraman Perumal Joseph Rabban and Thomas of Cana fought valiantly to save their town Similarly songs of both groups describe the Old Testament characters in a good extend The similarities are considered to be the common link between Malabar Jews and Knanaya Christians of Jewish origin formed in legends biblical stories and traditions

When the Portuguese arrived in Kerala the Knanaya Nasranis and Cochin Jews were persecuted for their beliefs An imperial order was issued to confiscate and auction the properties of those who celebrated Passover and Sukkot Circumcision and reading and writing in Hebrew and Aramaic were prohibited Tradition says Knanaya artifacts and texts were confiscated and burned by the Portuguese for being heretical and Knananites caught defying the imperial order were occasionally executed The oppressive Portuguese rule was sometimes resisted but these movements were futile since the Portuguese executed the protesters
The arrival of Thomas of Cana and his followers are said to be a rejuvenating support for Saint Thomas Christians spiritually They added the richness to the Syrian Church of Antioch traditions and teachings in Malabar Although the Knanaya remained part of the Syriac Catholic Church they maintained their ethnic heritage The Syrian Church prospered until the 15thcentury arrival of the Portuguese who tried to replace the Syrian rites with Latin ones In 1599 the Portuguese Archbishop Menesis of Goa held a synod at Udayamparoor and changed the Syrian ways which had existed during the arrival of the Knanaya Archbishop Menesis and his successors were able to convert some Syrians with their power and money However a group led by Knanaya priest Anjilimmoottil Ittythomman Kathanar Rev Itty Thomas resisted the Portuguese during the mid17th century The Knananites joined after they heard that Patriarch Ahathallah had been drowned by the Portuguese with about 25000 Syrian Christians assembled in Mattancherry near Cochin in January 1653 and pledged with others that they would not accept the Latin teachings After the pledge known as the Coonan Cross Oath Koonan Kurishu Satyam the Syrian church split in two One group led by Thomas Arkadion of Pakalomattom and Ittythomman Kathanar continued to follow the Syrian faith and the other group accepted the Roman faith The Knanaya split into two groups the Knanaya Jacobites Southists and the Knanaya Catholics Northists
The Knanaya Vicariate Apostolic of Kottayam was created for Knanaya Catholics in 1911 It was elevated to an eparchy by Pope Pius X in his 1923 bull Universi Christiani The eparchy of Kottayam was elevated to the rank of a metropolitan see without a suffragan eparchy in 2005

Desmodium incanum
Desmodium incanum is a perennial plant native to Central and South America known as creeping beggarweed Spanish clover or Spanish ticktrefoil In Hawaii it is known as kaimi or kaimi clover from the Hawaiian for the seeker It is sometimes considered a weed and has spread through Florida and across the southern USA into southern Texas and across many Pacific islands including Hawaii

There has been longstanding confusion about the correct scientific name This was long held to be Desmodium canum and therefore for quite some time D incanum was believed to be the correct name for the plant today called Desmodium laxiflorum

It has branched runners for reproduction Its leaves are elliptic in shape and are hairy and its flowers are pink to rose in color Very frustrating in agriculture are its seedpods When ripe they easily break off from the plant and due to their tiny hairs they stick to any rough surface The skin and hairs of an animal for example Or the clothing of the person who walks through them And every pod is to pull out separately one by one afterwards

The name Spanish clover can also refer to Lotus purshianus a native pea of California

Waddy
A waddy nulla nulla or hunting stick is an Aboriginal Australian club for use in hunting and fighting The first of these names comes from the Dharuk Aborigines of Port Jackson Sydney

A waddy is a heavy club constructed of carved timber Waddies have been used in handtohand combat and were capable of splitting a shield and killing or stunning prey In addition to this they could be employed as a projectile as well as used to make fire and make ochre They found further use in punishing those who broke Aboriginal law which often involved settling a conflict between individuals or between an individual and a group in a Trial by Ordeal in which fighters gave and suffered heavy blows resulting in skull and bone fractures and much blood

They were made by both men and women and could be painted or left unpainted Their construction varied from tribe to tribe but they were generally about one metre in length and sometimes had a stone head attached with bees wax and string They were made from where a branch met the tree or from a young tree pulled up with its roots from the ground 

Waddy has also been spelled as wadi wady and waddie The spelling stabilised around the midnineteenth century partly to help distinguish it from the Arabic word  a dry water course

Vroegh v Eastman Kodak Co
Vroegh v Eastman Kodak Company et al is a class action complaint that alleges that the defendants in marketing advertising andor packaging their Flash Memory Cards and Flash Memory Drives Defendants misrepresent the size of the memory storage contained in the Flash Memory Cards and Flash Memory Drives The complaint accuses the defendants of false advertising unfair business practices breach of contract fraud deceit andor misrepresentation and violation of the California Consumers Legal Remedy Act

The complaint case number CGC04428953 was originally filed in Superior Court of the State of California for the county of San Francisco on February 20 2004 The complaint was first filed as Vroegh vs Dane Elec Corp USA A Foreign Corporation et al When DaneElec settled and was dismissed from the case on March 15 2005 Eastman Kodak became the first defendant Another plaintiff intervened in January 2004

The complaint originally named the following companies as defendants

The gravamen of the complaint is the alleged loss in hard drive capacity that is caused by the difference between the measurements calculated using the binary prefix and SI prefix systems

On August 16 2006 there was a proposed final judgement on a proposed settlement and on November 1 2006 LexisNexis reported in their California Legal News that the settlement agreement calls for 24M in attorney fees The settlement was finally approved on or about November 21 2006 The settlement provided for either a refund of 5 of the original purchase price or a 10 coupon on future purchases The refund amount is in excess of the amount of memory that was allegedly missing Accordingly the settlement made available to class members refunds in excess of 100 million 

Five defendants including Dane Elec settled the case on a nonclass basis The other five defendants Eastman Kodak Company Fuji Photo Film USA Inc Lexar Media Inc PNY Technologies Inc and SanDisk Corporation settled on a class basis

The law firm of Gutride Safier LLP and Milberg Weiss have been involved in other significant class action lawsuits in California from which they applied for significant fee payments Such fee requests are often cited as unreasonable in that they call into question the true motivation of the attorneys as was the case with these particular attorneys The requested fees however were required to be and were approved by courts Two of the most notable class actions brought by Gutride Safier are the Chavez v Netflix class action that was settled but is currently on appeal when the defendants agreed to pay Gutride Safier 25 million and the Orin Safier v Western Digital Corporation class action that was settled when the defendants agreed to pay Gutride Safier 500000 The Western Digital case involved the same binary vs decimal calculation issue as the Vroegh v Eastman Kodak case In each of these cases the named plaintiff was awarded 1000 to 2000 for their time and effort

Even though Netflix agreed to pay 25 million the Judge in the case ultimately awarded Gutride Safier approximately 13 million

On June 23 2003 Gutride and Safier brought a Business Tort complaint against numerous defendants including Amazoncom Target Corporation WalMart Corporation Dell GoodGuys and many others for false and deceptive advertising of MP3 players on the same binary vs decimal calculation issue Ultimately all of the defendants settled

H331
H331 is part of the ITU suite of standards for Video Teleconferencing This standard is used for broadcast of videoconferences as opposed to pointtopoint links

A standard H320 terminal ie ISDN endpoint can be modified to provide oneway pointtomultipoint data transmissions broadcasts These broadcasts can be likened to television broadcasts H331 specifies how H320 terminals act in situations where there is no data path from receivers back to transmitters making normal twoway negotiation impossible
In such a situation no MCU is needed

Standard applications include

Often lowbitrate digital satellite transmission is used for such services with one uplink site sending H320 video and many receiving stations

Enid song
Enid is a song by the Canadian alternative rock group Barenaked Ladies It was written by Steven Page and Ed Robertson and released as the lead single from their 1992 debut album Gordon The song was successful in their home country reaching number two on the RPM Top Singles chart to become their highestcharting single until Its All Been Done reached number one in 1999 Enid was Canadas 28th most successful song of 1992

The songs title was inspired by Enid Egers a waitress at Spankys Pub in Moncton New Brunswick The band found it interesting that Enid spelled backwards is dine Although she was the source of the title itself the main thrust of the song is about Steven Pages first girlfriend

The original studio version has been described as one of the most complex recordings of the bands earlier career by Steven Page in the liner notes for Disc One All Their Greatest Hits It includes a horn section pedal steel guitar a cuica and a pastiche of Depeche Mode as an intro the voice in which is that of producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda

The music video was made in 1992 and was the bands second official video It features the band playing in a room with a redwhiteandblue ball theme similar to the Gordon cover The band stated in Barelaked Nadies probably jokingly that the video was originally supposed to be a parody of the film Delicatessen One of the videos gimmicks is that the film keeps cutting without the camera being moved resulting in the band members disappearing and reappearing and moving around in shots Also in the room are TV screens showing the band playing in other locations such as Kensington Market and St James Park

The song was nominated for Single of the Year at the 1993 Juno Awards although it lost to Beauty and the Beast by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson

Medicago lupulina
Medicago lupulina commonly known as black medick nonesuch or hop clover is a plant of dry grassland belonging to the legume or clover family Plants of the genus Medicago or bur clovers are closely related to the true clovers Trifolium and sweet clover Melilotus Like the true clovers black medick has three leaflets and a small yellow flower closely resembling those of lesser trefoil Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa

The generic name Medicago is derived via Latin  from Ancient Greek  Median because alfalfa was believed to have been introduced from the region of Media in antiquity The specific name lupulina means wolflike and refers to the hop or willowwolf Humulus lupulus Its scientific name is a translation of the common name hop clover or hopclover which is also used for several members of the genus Trifolium

Also spelled medic or meddick the plant is known by a number of alternate names including nonesuch black nonesuch black medic clover hop clover hop medic black clover black hay blackweed English trefoil hop trefoil and yellow trefoil Some of these names are also applied to wildflowers of the related genera Trifolium and Melilotus

Medicago lupulina is an annual or shortlived perennial plant growing each year from adventitious buds on the roots Mature plants measure from in height with fine stems often lying flat at the beginning of growth and later erecting The leaves are compound each with three oval leaflets carried on a short petiole the center leaflet usually has a longer petiole The leaflets are hairy toothed toward the tip and differ from those of the similar Trifolium dubium in that they end in a short point

Black medick has small 23 mm yellow flowers grouped in tight bunches compact racemes On larger plants the flower heads may reach or more The fruit is a singleseeded pod 15 to 3 mm in diameter that does not open upon maturation but hardens and turns black when ripe Each pod contains a single ambercolored seed

Like other legumes the roots of black medick contain nodules hosting nitrogenfixing bacteria Plants that survive for more than one year may develop a deep tap root

A native of the old world black medick is found throughout Europe north Africa the near east and most of Asia including India China and Korea It is naturalized in central Asia Japan South Africa Australia New Zealand the United States Canada and much of South America Black medick is found throughout the United States including Hawaii and Alaska

Black medick thrives in dry to moist welldrained soils containing sand loam or clay and is a pioneer plant often growing on disturbed ground It grows in alkaline neutral and mildly acidic conditions It does not grow in shady areas Black medick grows well in limestone soils and on coastal sand dunes where it suffers less competition from the other plants and as such is found on many islands such as Taiwan the Canary Islands the Azores and Madeira It is resistant to cold and can be found on mountains up to 1800 meters

Black medick is one of the flowers used to make honey It is frequently found in natural pastures and may be planted in order to create artificial meadows especially on dry land The presence of black medick in large concentrations as a lawn weed may indicate that the soil is poor in nitrogen However because black medick and other clovers fix nitrogen in the soil this deficiency can improve over time due to the presence of these plants

Black medick is sometimes used as a fodder plant Its hardiness and ability to grow in poor soils as well as its tendency to fix nitrogen in the soil make black medick a good choice for pasturage although its fodder value is limited It is grazed by sheep but is not very palatable to cattle

Black medick may be confused with other plants that have three leaflets and small yellow flowers such as hop trefoil large hop trefoil lesser hop trefoil and yellow woodsorrel

The Great Gatsby 1974 film
The Great Gatsby is a 1974 American romantic drama film based on F Scott Fitzgeralds 1925 novel of the same name It was directed by Jack Clayton and produced by David Merrick from a screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola The film stars Robert Redford in the title role of Jay Gatsby along with Mia Farrow Sam Waterston Bruce Dern Karen Black Scott Wilson and Lois Chiles with Howard Da Silva who previously appeared in the 1949 version Roberts Blossom and Edward Herrmann A third film starring Tobey Maguire and Leonardo DiCaprio was released in 2013

The rights to the novel were purchased in 1971 by Robert Evans so that his wife Ali MacGraw could play Daisy After MacGraw left Evans for Steve McQueen he considered other actresses for the role including Faye Dunaway Candice Bergen Natalie Wood Katharine Ross Lois Chiles and Cybill Shepherd However Mia Farrow was cast as Daisy and Chiles was given the role of Jordan Warren Beatty Jack Nicholson and Steve McQueen declined the role of Jay Gatsby which went to Robert Redford Beatty wanted to direct producer Evans as Gatsby and Nicholson did not think that MacGraw was right for the role of Daisy who was still attached when he was approached Farrow was pregnant during production and the movie was filmed with her wearing loose flowing dresses and in tight closeups

Truman Capote was the original screenwriter but he was replaced by Francis Ford Coppola Coppola had just finished directing The Godfather but was unsure of its commercial reception and he needed the money He believes he got the job on the recommendation of Robert Redford who had liked a rewrite Coppola did on The Way We Were Coppola had read Gatsby but wasnt familiar with it He checked himself into a hotel room in Paris Oscar Wildes old room and started He later recalled
I was shocked to find that there was almost no dialogue between Daisy and Gatsby in the book and was terrified that Id have to make it all up So I did a quick review of Fitzgeralds short stories and as many of them were similar in that they were about a poor boy and a rich girl I helped myself to much of the authentic Fitzgerald dialogue from them I decided that perhaps an interesting idea would be to do one of those scenes that lovers typically have where they finally get to be together after much longing and have a talk all night scene which Id never seen in a film So I did that  I think a sixpage scene in which Daisy and Gatsby stay up all night and talk And I remember my wife telling me that she and the kids were in New York when The Godfather opened and it was a big hit and there were lines around the block at five theaters in the city which was unheard of at the time I said Yeah yeah but Ive got to finish the Gatsby script And I sent the script in just in time It had taken me two or three weeks to complete
On his commentary track for the DVD release of The Godfather Coppola refers to writing the Gatsby script adding Not that the director paid any attention to it The script that I wrote did not get made

William Goldman who loved the novel said in 2000 that he actively campaigned for the job of adapting the script but was astonished by the quality of Coppolas work
I still believe it to be one of the great adaptations I called him Coppola and told him what a wonderful thing he had done If you see the movie you will find all this hard to believe The director who was hired Jack Clayton is a Brit he had one thing all of them have in their blood a murderous sense of class Well Clayton decided this that Gatsbys parties were shabby and tacky given by a man of no elevation and taste There went the ball game As shot they were foul and stupid and the people who attended them were foul and silly and Robert Redford and Mia Farrow who would have been so perfect as Gatsby and Daisy were left hung out to dry Because Gatsby was a tasteless fool and why should we care about their love It was not as if Coppolas glory had been jettisoned entirely though it was tampered with plenty it was more that the reality and passions it depicted were gone

The Rosecliff and Marble House mansions in Newport Rhode Island were used for Gatsbys house while scenes at the Buchanans home were filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire England One driving scene was shot in Windsor Great Park UK Other scenes were filmed in New York City and Uxbridge Massachusetts

The film received mixed reviews The film was praised for its interpretation and staying true to the novel but was criticized for lacking any true emotion or feelings towards the Jazz Age Based on 34 total reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes the film has an overall approval rating of 41 with an average rating of 510 Despite this the film was a financial success making 26533200 against a 65 million budget

Tennessee Williams in his book Memoirs p178 wrote It seems to me that quite a few of my stories as well as my one acts would provide interesting and profitable material for the contemporary cinema if committed to  such cinematic masters of direction as Jack Clayton who made of The Great Gatsby a film that even surpassed I think the novel by Scott Fitzgerald

Vincent Canbys 1974 review in The New York Times typifies the critical ambivalence The sets and costumes and most of the performances are exceptionally good but the movie itself is as lifeless as a body thats been too long at the bottom of a swimming pool Canby wrote at the time As Fitzgerald wrote it The Great Gatsby is a good deal more than an illfated love story about the cruelties of the idle rich The movie cant see this through all its giant closeups of pretty knees and dancing feet Its frivolous without being much fun

Varietys review was likewise split

Roger Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four Comparing film to the book details Ebert stated

The authors daughter Scottie Fitzgerald Smith who sold the film rights had reread her fathers novel and noted how Mia Farrow onset looked the part as her fathers Daisy and portrayed a southern attitude while Robert Redford also asked advice to match the authors intent but her father she noted was more in the narrator Nick

The film won two Academy Awards for Best Costume Design Theoni V Aldredge and Best Music Nelson Riddle It also won three BAFTA Awards for Best Art Direction John Box Best Cinematography Douglas Slocombe and Best Costume Design Theoni V Aldredge The male costumes were executed by Ralph Lauren the female costumes by Barbara Matera It won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress Karen Black and received three further nominations for Best Supporting Actor Bruce Dern and Sam Waterston and Most Promising Newcomer Sam Waterston

The film was nominated by the American Film Institute for inclusion in the 2002 list of films AFIs 100 Years100 Passions

Significant symbols
In sociology a significant symbol is a gesture usually a vocal gesture that calls out in the individual making the gesture the same ie functionally identical response that is called out in others to whom the gesture is directed Significant symbols are a later byproduct of the meaning emergent in the act which meaning is described or accounted for in terms of symbols or language

Significant symbols originated by the social behaviorist George Herbert Mead who made a great impact in sociologist studies in the 20th century Mead was interested specifically in the work of Wilhelm Wundt It was from Wundt that Mead gained an understanding how the gesture is involved in social interaction This sociological term significant symbols is the basis for symbolic interactionism which attempts to define the self

Language in Meads view is communication through significant symbols Physical objects can be significant symbols but vocal gestures especially language are the crucial significant symbols Language brings out the same response in both the speaker and hearer Language is the highest form of communication a mature development of the gesture situation therefore the major tool of the interaction from which minds and selves emerge Language is important because it is the means by which an individual may convey his attitudes and assume the roles of others and thus participate in the interactionary creation of mind and self Language also makes possible the critically important ability of people to think to engage in mental processes Thinking as well as the mind is simply defined as conversation that people have with themselves using language this activity is like having a conversation with other people Language allows people to stimulate their own actions as well as those of others

Through roletaking and the development of significant gestures and symbols the mind develops as the ability to indicate to ones self the same response that ones gestures had brought out in others and to control the response in terms of it

Accuracy in roletaking also implies a preexisting social world of shared linguistic meanings that enable actors to respond to their own oncoming behavior in the same way as the other Without them roletaking and coordinated behavior could not proceed

Significant symbols specific meaning differs in various social situations

Significant communication may also be defined as the comprehension by the individual through the meaning of her gestures Mead describes the communication process as a social act since it necessarily requires at least two individuals in interaction with one another It is within this act that meaning arises The act of communication has a triadic structure consisting of the following components 

In and during the social contact the mind recognizes symbols and translates those symbols and acts or adjusts to symbols based on the previous knowledge of meaning

A gesture then is an action that implies a reaction The reaction is the meaning of the gesture and points toward the result the intentionality of the action initiated by the gesture Gestures become significant symbols when they absolutely arouse in an individual making them the same responses which they explicitly arouse or are intended to arouse in other individuals the individuals to whom they are addressed

Although people and animals employ insignificant gestures only people employ significant gestures or those that involve thought before a response is made

Significant symbols always imply a context within which it has significance a universe of discourse The universe of discourse is constituted by a group of individuals carrying on a common social process within which these symbols have common meaning within that group regardless of whether the members are making the gestures or responding to them

The Bridge to Freedom
The Bridge to Freedom an Ascended Master Teachings religion was established in 1951 by Geraldine Innocente and other students of the Ascended Masters after she received what was believed to be an anointing to become a messenger for the Great White Brotherhood This organization believed that their teachings had been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters These were believed to be individuals who had lived in physical bodies acquired the wisdom and mastery needed to become immortal and free of the cycles of reembodiment and karma attaining in this way their Ascension They considered the ascension to be the complete permanent union of the purified outer self with the I AM Presencemeaning that true identity that is the unique individualization of God for each person

The members of The Bridge to Freedom claim that a Dispensation and Sponsorship was given by the Ascended Masters for this Ascended Master Activity to be an outer organization representing the Great Brotherhood of Light and a continuation of previous efforts by the Ascended Masters to bring Illumination to mankind through Theosophy Agni Yoga and the I AM Activity

The members of The Bridge to Freedom believe that Ascended Master El Morya contacted Geraldine Innocente in 1944 and asked her to make a certain application on a daily basis The story is told that Morya returned one year later asking if she would consent to receive a series of Discourses from the Maha Chohan Geraldine is said to have agreed and she then underwent years of training in preparation for her role in the 1950s as a Messenger for the Ascended Masters the Archangels Cosmic Beings the Elohim and Others of the Spiritual Hierarchy She served officially in the capacity of Messenger beginning with the inaugural Vesta Dictation on July 17 1951 until her transition on June 21 1961

The Bridge to Freedom claims that in 1952 the Ascended Master Saint Germain stated that

    It was never intended to start a new Activity but to broaden the field of service of the present Activity by engaging the competent and willing service of lifestreams not presently allowed full expression of their talents in widening the borders of the Fathers Kingdom Many hundreds of thousands of souls have not been privileged to receive the Instruction brought forth in My Name due to barriers of language limitation in the production and distribution of illuminating literature and the unhappy excommunications which resulted from misunderstanding of a human nature    A way and means by which We might reach the consciousness of the people had to be devised The Bridge was the solution to this problem Mrs Ballard was informed prior to any other individual of the purpose for which The Bridge came forth and was courteously invited to allow Us the opportunity of supporting her work and performing through other well qualified individuals the task of reaching other lifestreams than those presently blessed by the knowledge of The I AM Activity    The Sun cannot limit its shining to one beam nor the Love of God to one human consciousness no matter how well attuned it may have been to the Vibrations of the Masters The souls of men are our concern all men of all colors all countries because from the Flame in their hearts will come the Illumination which will make this Dark Star a Flaming Sun of Freedom     

It is believed that in September 1952 the Master Morya explained through Geraldine Innocente the purpose of the founding of The Bridge to Freedom

    The beloved Maha Chohan gave Me a limited Grant saying that the response of the few whom I had chosen would determine whether I could continue such an association With well justified trepidation I endeavored to correspond with the most likely and promising of those who professed to love Us and Our Way Their response made it possible for Me to continue this Endeavor Now many good and fine lifestreams like a golden chain girdling the Earth make it possible for Us to transmit the current Action of the Brothers around the planet and bless all life and stimulate all souls by this universal service This is the purpose of The Bridge The Bulletin and this expanded service which is but a part of the one Plan even as the foundation is laid and a beautiful Spiritual Edifice built thereon Without the Hierarchy the Earth would long ago have passed into oblivion the electrons which compose it returned to the universe and the souls depending upon it for existence snuffed out like candles before the wind

Laura Smith Haviland
Laura Smith Haviland December 20 1808 April 20 1898 was an American abolitionist suffragette and social reformer She was an important figure in the history of the Underground Railroad

Laura Smith Haviland was born on December 20 1808 in Kitley Township Ontario Canada to American parents Daniel Smith and Asenath Sene Blancher who had immigrated shortly before her birth Haviland wrote that Daniel was a man of ability and influence of clear perceptions and strong reasoning powers while her mother Sene was of a gentler turn  a quiet spirit benevolent and kind to all and much beloved by all who knew her The Smiths farmers of modest means were devout members of the Society of Friends better known as Quakers Havilands father was a minister in the Society and her mother was an Elder

Though the Quakers dressed plainly and strictly forbade dancing singing and other pursuits they deemed frivolous many of their views were progressive by the standards of the day The Quakers encouraged the equal education of men and women an extraordinarily forwardthinking position in an age when most individuals were illiterate and providing a woman with a thorough education was largely viewed as unnecessary Quaker women as well as men acted as ministers While most Quakers did not agitate vocally for abolition the majority condemned slavery as brutal and unjust It was in this atmosphere that Haviland was raised

In 1815 her family left Canada and returned to the United States settling in the remote and sparsely populated town of Cambria in western New York At the time there was no school near their home and for the next six years Havilands education consisted of little more than a spelling lesson given to her daily by her mother Haviland described herself as an inquisitive child deeply interested in the workings of the world around her who at a young age began questioning her parents about everything from scripture to Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation Once she had mastered spelling Haviland supplemented her meager education by devouring every book she could borrow from friends relatives and neighbors reading everything from religious material to serious historical studies

At sixteen Laura met Charles Haviland Jr a devout young Quaker whose parents were both respected ministers They were married on November 11 1825 at Lockport New York According to Laura Charles was a devoted husband and theirs was a happy marriage They were the parents of eight children

The Havilands spent the first four years of their marriage in Royalton Township near Lockport New York before moving in September 1829 to Raisin Lenawee County in the Michigan Territory They settled three miles 5km from the homestead her parents acquired four years earlier Michigan was then a largely unsettled wilderness but land was cheap and there were a number of other Quakers in the vicinity

Haviland vividly recalled seeing African Americans verbally abused and even physically assaulted in Lockport New York when she was a child These experiences combined with the horrific descriptions in John Woolmans history of the slavetrade made an indelible impression

The pictures of these crowded slaveships with the cruelties of the slave system after they were brought to our country often affected me to tears  My sympathies became too deeply enlisted for the poor negroes who were thus enslaved for time to efface

Haviland and other members of the Raisin community helped Elizabeth Margaret Chandler organize the Logan Female AntiSlavery Society in 1832 It was the first antislavery organization in Michigan Five years later in 1837 Haviland and her husband founded a manual labor school  designed for indigent children which was later known as the Raisin Institute Haviland instructed the girls in household chores while her husband and one of her brothers Harvey Smith taught the boys to perform farm work At the Havilands insistence the school was open to all children regardless of race creed or sex It was the first racially integrated school in Michigan Some of Havilands white students upon learning they were to study with African Americans threatened to leave Most were persuaded to remain however and Laura wrote that once the students were together in the classroom their prejudices soon melted away

In 1838 Harvey Smith sold his farm and the proceeds were used to erect accommodations for fifty students The Havilands expanded the schools curriculum operating it more closely along the lines of traditional elementary and secondary schools They then hired a graduate of Oberlin College to serve as the schools principal Due to their diligence the Raisin Institute was soon recognized as one of the best schools in the Territory

As the Havilands became more actively involved in antislavery work tensions grew within the Quaker community There was a split between the socalled radical abolitionists like the Havilands who wanted immediate emancipation and the majority of Orthodox Quakers Although the Quakers condemned slavery most did not approve of active participation in abolitionist societies By 1839 in order to continue with their abolitionist work the Havilands her parents and fourteen other likeminded Quakers felt compelled to resign their membership They then joined a group of Methodists known as the Wesleyans who were equally devoted to the abolitionist cause

In the spring of 1845 an epidemic of erysipelas killed six members of Havilands family including both of her parents her husband and her youngest child Haviland also fell ill but survived At thirtysix Haviland found herself a widow with seven children to support a farm to run the Raisin Institute to manage and substantial debts to repay Sadly just two years later tragedy struck again when her eldest son died Due to lack of funds Haviland was forced to close the Raisin Institute in 1849

In spite of her personal losses she continued with her abolitionist work and in 1851 she helped organize the Refugee Home Society in Windsor Ontario Canada Fugitive slaves were settled there a church and school were erected for them and each family was given twentyfive acres to farm Laura remained on for several months as the settlements teacher She then traveled to Ohio where with her daughter Anna she taught in a school founded for African American children in Cincinnati and Toledo Ohio

By 1856 she had raised enough funds to reopen the Raisin Institute and returned to Michigan The new curriculum included having former slaves give lectures about the realities of life on a slave plantation The Institute closed once again in 1864 after most of the staff and some of the students enlisted to fight during the Civil War

During the 1830s the Haviland family began hiding runaway slaves on their farm Their home became the first Underground Railroad station established in Michigan After her husbands death Haviland continued to shelter fugitive slaves in her home in some cases personally escorting them to Canada She played an important role in the Detroit branch of the group where she was considered railroad superintendent with George DeBaptiste the presidentand William Lambert the vice president or secretary

She also traveled to the South on multiple occasions to aid escaped slaves Her first trip was made in 1846 in an effort to free the children of fugitive slaves Willis and Elsie Hamilton The children were still in the possession of their mothers former slave owner John P Chester a tavernkeeper in Washington County Tennessee

Chester had learned of the Hamiltons whereabouts and sent slavecatchers after them When that failed Chester attempted to lure the Hamiltons to his plantation with the promise that they would be treated as freedmen and reunited with their children Suspecting a trap Haviland went to Tennessee in their place accompanied by her son Daniel and a student from the Raisin Institute James Martin who posed as Willis Hamilton Mr Chester became irate once he realized Willis Hamilton was not with Mrs Haviland He held the trio at gunpoint threatening to murder them kidnap James Martin and enslave him in Willis Hamiltons stead They managed to escape but Mr Chester did not forget Laura Haviland His family would continue to haunt her for fifteen years pursuing her legally in court and privately with slave catchers while barraging her with derogatory letters The following letter was sent by Chesters son Thomas K Chester in February 1847 Its provides a good example of the tone which permeated the Chester familys correspondence with Haviland

Haviland responded sarcastically thanking him for naming the child after her family and stating that she hoped like Moses may he become instrumental in leading his people away from a worse bondage than that of Egypt Enraged by what he deemed her insolence Thomas Chester placed a bounty on Havilands head All throughout the South he circulated handbills fliers describing Mrs Haviland detailing her abolitionist work naming her place of residence and offering 3000 a considerable sum at the time to anyone willing to kidnap or murder her on his behalf

Three years later after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law the Chester family attempted to have Haviland tried under the new statute for stealing their slaves Haviland not only ran the risk of being physically harmed by angry slaveowners like the Chesters or their slavecatchers if found guilty of violating the Fugitive Slave Law she would also be subject to hefty fines and imprisonment Still Haviland was determined to continue with her work no matter what the personal cost

 I would not for my right hand become instrumental in returning one escaped slave to bondage I firmly believe in our Declaration of Independence that all men are created free and equal and that no human being has a right to make merchandise of others born in humbler stations and place them on a level with horses cattle and sheep knocking them off the auctionblock to the highest bidder sundering family ties and outraging the purest and tenderest feelings of human nature

Fortunately for Haviland her case was brought before Judge Ross Wilkins who sympathized with the abolitionists The Chesters attempted to regain possession of the Hamiltons by force but were prevented by Haviland and her neighbors Judge Wilkins delayed her case allowing Haviland to help the Hamiltons escape to Canada In the end Haviland evaded legal punishment

In addition to another failed rescue attempt detailed in her autobiography Haviland later made other more successful journeys south that went unmentioned in her memoirs In the guise of a white cook and once even posing as a fair skinned free person of color she visited plantations and managed to help some slaves escape north

 During the Civil War Laura toured many refugee camps and hospitals even venturing onto the frontlines to distribute supplies to displaced citizens freed slaves and soldiers

In the spring of 1865 the commissioner of the newly created Freedmens Bureau General Oliver O Howard named Haviland Inspector of Hospitals Havilands actual duties consisted of far more than inspecting hospitals She spent the next two years traveling through Virginia Tennessee Kansas and Washington DC distributing supplies reporting on the living conditions of Freedmen and indigent whites organizing refugee camps establishing schools working as a teacher volunteering as a nurse at Freedmens hospitals and giving public lectures In an effort to help whites understand what the Freedmen had endured under slavery she toured abandoned plantations and collected chains irons restraints and other implements which had been used on slaves Haviland transported these items north and exhibited them during her lectures She also met personally with President Andrew Johnson to petition for the release of former slaves still being held in Southern prisons for attempting years before to escape slavery

While working at the Freedmens Hospital in Washington DC Haviland met and befriended Sojourner Truth who later recalled an incident that took place one day when they had gone into town to get supplies Haviland suggested they take a street car back to the hospital Truth described what happened next as follows

After the Civil War the Freedmens Aid Commission acquired the former Raisin Institute renamed it the Haviland Home and converted it into an orphanage for African American children Its first residents were seventyfive homeless children brought by Haviland from Kansas As other children joined their ranks and their numbers increased many whites in Michigan became unnerved They claimed that Haviland was burdening white taxpayers and demanded that Haviland Home be closed Matters came to a head in 1867 when the orphanage was purchased by the American Missionary Association who closed the orphanage and literally threw the orphans out into the street

Haviland abandoned her work in Washington DC to return to Michigan and help the children She managed to collect enough donations to purchase the orphanage and began to manage it herself By 1870 funds were extremely scarce The situation became so dire that at Havilands urging the state took over the orphanage and it became the Michigan Orphan Asylum

When the Reconstruction ended in 1877 many African Americans fled the South where they were subject to attacks by racist individuals and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan Thousands of African American men women and children crowded into makeshift refugee camps in Kansas Determined to help Haviland set out with her daughter Anna for Washington DC where she testified about the appalling conditions at the camps before traveling to Kansas with supplies for the refugees Using her personal savings Haviland purchased in Kansas for the Freedmen at one of the refugee camps to live on and farm

During her life Laura Haviland not only combated slavery and worked to improve the living conditions of Freedmen she was also actively involved in other social causes advocating for womens suffrage and helping to organize the Womens Christian Temperance Union in Michigan

Laura Haviland died on April 20 1898 in Grand Rapids Michigan at the home of her brother Samuel Smith She is buried next to her husband in the Raisin Valley Cemetery in Adrian Michigan

Symbolically at Havilands funeral hymns were sung by a choir of white and African American singers and then her casket was carried to the grave by a group white and African American pallbearers

In recognition of her efforts the town of Haviland Kansas was named in her honor A statue of Laura Haviland stands in front of the Lenawee County Historical Museum in Adrian Michigan The inscription on the statue reads

A Tribute to a Life Consecrated to the Betterment of Humanity

Laura Smith Haviland Elementary School in Waterford Michigan is named in her honor

Palmer Hayden
Palmer C Hayden January 15 1890  February 18 1973 was an American painter who depicted AfricanAmerican life landscapes seascapes and African influences He sketched painted in both oils and watercolors and was a prolific artist of his era

Born Peyton Cole Hedgeman on January 15 1890 in Widewater Virginia Palmer C Hayden drew during his childhood and was introduced into the arts by his older brother who drew as well Speculations regarding how many other siblings he had exist but cannot be proved Despite his early interest in art Haydens initial ambition was to become a fiddle player but several obstacles prevented this two of which were his demure nature and the financial hardships of his family In reflection years into his seniority Hayden stated he still continued to regret not following his initial ambition unwavered by his success as an artist This conflict is reflected at times in his art in particular Midnight at the Crossroads is a personal painting that depicts the decision he was forced to make The explicit tilt of his feet and face in the direction of the musicians path yet his ultimate descent down the path of the artist signifies just how powerful of a conflict this was for Hayden

As an adolescent Hayden relocated to Washington DC in order to find work where he became a porter and an errand boy The subject of his sketches shifted to objects and activities he witnessed daily such as sailboats and fishermen It was in Washington DC where Hayden ultimately began to pursue an art career and where he first encountered an experience with explicit racism Hayden had placed an ad in the local paper for an artists assistant and was bewildered when he was rejected for being AfricanAmerican upon arriving at the interview Discouraged Hayden decided to go into employment as a laborer for the Buffalo Bill Circus and then the Ringling Brothers Circus He bounced from occupation to occupation with little commitment then decided to enter the armys black company stationed in the Philippines Hayden in the army

During his army service Hayden was stripped of his birth name and was given the name Palmer Hayden instead by a commanding sergeant during World War I The justification behind this abrupt decision is speculated but ultimately unknown and two popular theories have emerged within the community of art historian one theory is employed in Bearden and Hendersons book A History of African American Artists 1792 to the Present in which the story follows Hayden asking for a letter of reference from his previous job but having his name mistakenly written as Palmer Hayden instead of Peyton Hedgeman Unwilling to ask for another letter that correctly identified him he took the letter and adopted the name Palmer Hayden as he transitioned into the army The alternate theory is stated in Driskells Harlem Renaissance Art of Black America where it is claimed his commanding sergeant mispronounced his real name giving him the name Palmer Hayden instead Despite the modern dispute it has been factually determined that he thereafter referred to himself as Palmer Hayden and eventually legally changed his name a decade later Within the army he found himself pleased with the amount of spare time he had and even found a tutor in second lieutenant Arthur Boetscher who enjoyed map drawing and would often loosely instruct Hayden This marked Haydens first real encounter with any form of artistic education After four years of participation Hayden decided to enlist again and this time was assigned to the 10th Cavalry at West Point While he was not a cadet his role was taking care and training the horses that the cadets learned to ride on At this time he also enrolled himself in a correspondence drawing course on which he spent 10 monthly out of the 18 he made monthly

After he was discharged from the army he relocated to Greenwich Village a neighborhood located in lower Manhattan within New York City During the pursuit of his slowly developing art career he worked as a postal clerk janitor and a variety of other parttime jobs in order to provide for himself This period of his life was disheartening but was justified when Hayden eventually became a prolific Harlem artist of his era

Hayden pursued artistic professionalism by studying charcoal drawing at Columbia University as he simultaneously worked nights at the post office While this initially satisfied him he later determined that his night job ate up more of his time than he liked so he quit and began janitorial services in various apartment buildings throughout New York City Coincidentally the first tenant he worked for was Victor Perard an artist and art instructor at the Cooper Union previously called the Cooper Institute Hayden was hired to clean Perards studio and was encouraged to continue to develop his art

Hayden eventually decided to pursue a formal education and studied at the Cooper Union in New York City Columbia University and privately with Perard practicing independent studies at Boothbay Art Colony in Maine during the summers as well A chance encounter with Alice Dike a woman for whom he was moving furniture led to the discussion of art and his experience as an artist Compelled by his cause Dike provided him with a brochure from her church broadcasting The Harmon Foundations Award for Distinguished Achievement which encouraged individuals to participate and enter their pieces Hayden decided to enter and in 1926 he won a sum of money and a gold medal for his painting Schooners after being recognized as the recipient of the Distinguished Achievement in Visual Arts in the Harmon Foundations first awards ceremony In response to this honor a New York Times headline crudely glorified him stating Negro Worker Wins Harmon Art Prizes Gold Medal and 400 Awarded to Man who Washes Windows to Have Time to Paint suggesting his employment and race were defining factors of his craft as opposed to his extensive efforts While racially involved themes were not quite yet prominent concepts in Haydens work The Harmon Foundations white founder William E Harmon was nonetheless making a blatant social statement by publicly praising art created by an AfricanAmerican man from a struggling background The award is additionally credited for launching his career as an artist because of how prestigious of an accomplishment it was seen for anyone but especially for a simple janitor

Haydens success with The Harmon Foundation allowed the existence of his premier solo show in April 1926 at the Civic Club Following his achievements Hayden combined accumulated funds as well as his trophy money from The Harmon Foundation and a gracious gift of 3000 from Dike to travel to Paris France where he found further inspiration for his art He did not enroll in art school there but the next five years spent in Paris were productive regardless and Hayden captured not only Parisian society but also the integration of AfroEuropean into the upscale environment He was mentored for a short while by an artist named Clivette Le Fevre but ultimately the relationship ended because of Le Fevres disbelief in Haydens talents Haydens years in Paris as well as his arguably primitive style is particularly evident in the 1930 piece Nous Quatre a Paris which portrays four black men in a cafe drawn with stereotypically large lips and cartoonish facial features to emphasize characteristically black features that were shunned and often seen as revolting as a result of the discourse from white beauty

While in France Hayden did not remain stationed in Paris and also traveled to the coasts in order to continue painting landscapes and seascapes He was particularly fond of Concarneau a small village primarily sustained by fishermen and painted several scenes of the town one of which being Concarneau  Andre de la Mer He also visited several museums and a variety of exhibits such as the Louvre and found inspiration within its walls Hayden became acquainted with philosopher Alain Locke who showed him African art he had collected from his extensive travels Haydens admiration for African art led him to paintings depicting African designs patterns and forms such as Fetiche et Fleurs in 1933 He was also fascinated by the establishment of colonial Northern African towns and sketched what he saw in museums and exhibits

After five years abroad traveling with funds borrowed from the American Aid Society of Paris a nonprofit organization meant to support Americans abroad Hayden decided to return to the United States on August 11 1932 He remained in New York City where he had lived before going abroad and upon his return he became a Works Progress Administration artist with an impressive salary of about 30 weekly 

In contrast to his active involvement with African culture and racism abroad Hayden painted mostly buildings and landscapes at this time In his free time he continued with oil and watercolor paintings but also dabbled in pen and ink drawings His artwork is most notable for depicting AfricanAmerican life during the Harlem Renaissance as well as racial conflictsobstacles perceptions of racism and African folklore His paintings have been described by some critics as primitive and demeaning for depicting xenophobic stereotypes of African Americans by exaggerating bosoms lips and nostrils and portraying the mass consumption of watermelon and other foods associated with black racism such as in The Watermelon Race Other art historians find some of the earliest indications of black empowerment in Haydens work for his ownership and embracement of defining stereotypes that he regurgitated at critics through their exaggerated impact A great number of his paintings following his years in Paris were associated with the Harlem Renaissance and black urban life in the city However while depictions of AfricanAmerican life are what he is most remembered for they are not his sole claim to fame Haydens career began with landscape portrayal and this continued simultaneously alongside his racially influenced art with nature originally more prominent than the depictions of AfricanAmerican life A particular interest of his was seascapes and life in bustling harbors as it had been in his adolescence These particular scenes often held a religious significance for him which was not further elaborated on by Hayden Additionally as his comfort within the artistic community grew he offered a political voice in his paintings and in 1935 he depicted The Execution of NIRA which referenced the Supreme Courts refusal of the National Industrial Recovery Act on the grounds of unconstitutionality Hayden branching out artistically became more evident as his work became more outspoken and experimental

One of Haydens most prolific works came in 1937 when he created the iconic alleged narrative The Janitor Who Paints This painting labeled a protest painting  la The Execution of NIRA was thought by critics to be a personal commentary on Haydens sentiments regarding the assorted meagerly paid early jobs he had to take in order to survive that he was criticized for in the press Despite his success and popularity not only in America but also in Europe Hayden was still regarded by some as an lowly janitor who had little to no artistic training and worth In this painting an AfricanAmerican woman man and child are depicted in a crowded area which is made even more stifled by a canvas cleaning supplies and simple home decoration All three are shown with thick prominent lips characteristic of caricatures of African people and in the first draft a bold portrait of Abraham Lincoln was hung on the wall The title of the painting as well as the contrast of cleaning supplies and art material imply a balance such as the one that existed in Haydens own life before he was recognized for his work Inevitably Hayden was scrutinized by both the black and white community as problematic for seemingly endorsing negative stereotypes in this painting as well

Ten years after his initial visit in 1926 Hayden returned to Paris briefly little else is known about this visit He was back in New York within a year and at the age of 50 he married Miriam Huffman He decided in 1944 to begin a new project which resulted in a threeyear effort that culminated his most fulfilling works The John Henry series The idea was rooted in a legend he had been told in childhood by his father and he took to researching the legitimacy of the folktale drawing inspiration to integrate into his art Any other explanations for why Hayden felt so strongly about John Henry and the series as a whole are unclear and unspecified but are most likely linked to his proud ties to the AfricanAmerican community

In his elder years Hayden continued to be active with his art regularly being selected for prestigious awards and traveling between Paris and the United States to fuel his inspiration Racism remained a relevant topic in his life and art leading him to publicly speak out against racist policies hindering the AfricanAmerican and Hispanic communities An example of this was seen in 1966 when Hayden wrote to William Booth the Chairman of the City Commission on Human Rights regarding the advocacy for an equal number of African Americans Latinos and white people on the board to prevent mistreatment fueled by prejudice and power 

Hayden died on February 18 1973 shortly after receiving a grant to depict Negro soldiers between the world wars

Turn knot
A turn is one round of rope on a pin or cleat or one round of a coil Turns can be made around various objects through rings or around the standing part of the rope itself or another rope A turn also denotes a component of a knot

When the legs of a loop are brought together and crossed the rope has taken a turn One distinguishes between single turn round turn and two round turns depending on the number of revolutions around an object The benefit of round turns is best understood from the capstan equation

A riding turn is a section of rope that passes on top of another section of rope often parallel or at only a slight angle to the section below Examples of riding turns can be seen in both the constrictor knot and the strangle knot The second course of wrappings in some seizing knots can be referred to as riding turns The formation of an unintentional riding turn on a sailing winch can cause it to jam

A single hitch is a type of knot This hitch is actually a turn tied around an object where the end is secured by its own standing part

Hammonds flycatcher
Hammonds flycatcher Empidonax hammondii is a flycatcher in the family Tyrannidae This small insectivorous bird inhabits the coniferous and mixed forests of western North America The name of this bird commemorates William Alexander Hammond who was the surgeon general of the US Army Hammond collected bird specimens for Spencer Fullerton Baird

Adults are 1214cm long 4755in span about 22cm 87in across the wing and weigh 812 g 0304oz They have grayisholive upperparts darker on the wings and tail with whitish underparts they have a conspicuous white eye ring white wing bars a small bill and a short tail The breast is washed with grey and the sides of the belly with yellow Female usually have a shorter wider bill compare with males Immature are similar to adults but have broader wing bars and are more buff

Many species of Empidonax flycatchers look closely alike Hammonds flycatchers are mainly confused with Dusky E oberholseri and Gray E wrightii flycatchers which are similar in color and size and have an overlapping range The best way to distinguish the Hammonds flycatcher is by its call breeding habitat andor range

Hammonds flycatchers are part of the genus Empidonax which includes a dozen of other species Despite the relatively large range of the species the Hammonds flycatcher does not present a lot of genetic variations This might be the result of a bottleneck event that could have occurred when the species range was confined to the South of the Pleistocene ice The birds morphology including its plumage is also consistent across its range However there are evidence showing that some Hammonds flycatcher on Vancouver Island in British Columbia have evolved longer thicker bills in the absence of Western flycatchers which occupy a very similar niche but usually has a thicker bill than the Hammonds flycatcher The Hammonds the Dusky and the Gray flycatchers are sister species with no evidence of interbreeding

The Hammonds flycatcher is a migratory species breeding in Western North America and wintering in Mexico and Central America

Their preferred breeding habitats are mature coniferous and mixed forests They are typically found in dense fir forests conifer and aspen forests and dogwood Their habitats on wintering grounds are similar to the ones used as breeding grounds

Hammonds flycatchers can be found in the Western United States including Montana Wyoming California Nevada Utah Arizona New Mexico and Colorado In Canada their range include British Columbia Yukon and Alberta Certain birds have been found as far North as Alaska Overall their breeding range is formed by regions that have been greatly influenced by past glaciation events These birds are migratory and winter in Mexico and in Central America

The song is a multi versed hoarse ssilit greeep silit pweet The call is a sharp peek

Hammonds flycatchers do not sing during the fall migration or on wintering grounds They start singing in early May shortly after their arrival on breeding grounds The frequency of the song is usually higher at the beginning of the mating season and drops as summer progresses males that do not have a partner sing more often and at a higher frequency than paired males

Like in other species of the genus Empidonax bill snapping and mandibles clicking are commonly used in a threatening context

Their favorite preys include beetles flies bees butterflies and moths with a mean length of 57mm and a mean weight of 1656mg True beetles and netwinged insects can also be part of their diet They wait on an open perch high or in the middle of a tree and fly out to catch insects in flight hawking also sometimes picking insects from foliage while hovering gleaning

These birds are believed to be monogamous and show no evidence of extrapair copulation Male Hammonds flycatcher physically fight at the beginning of the breeding season locking themselves together in midair and fluttering to the ground They tend to nest on high small to medium sized branches of tall trees They also prefer areas where they can be covered by leaves on the northeast or southwest sides of trees Finally they prefer oldgrowth forest with a minimum age of 80 to 90 years

They make a cup nest on a fork in a tree Females usually lay in early June three or four creamy white eggs sometimes marked with small reddishbrown dots The female incubates the eggs for about 15 days The hatchlings are altricial both the male and the female are responsible of feeding the young

Gadrooning
Gadrooning is a decorative motif consisting of convex curves in a series In furniture and other decorative arts it is an ornamental carved band of tapered curving and sometimes alternating concave and convex sections usually diverging obliquely either side of a central point often with rounded ends vaguely reminiscent of flower petals Gadrooning derived from Roman sarcophagi illustration and other antiquities was widely used during the Italian Renaissance and in the classicising phases of 18th and early 19thcentury design

In medieval European metalwork gadroons on circular dishes are often tapering ending in a point on a central circular zone and run diagonally across the surface in a spiral Similar but typically not tapered designs were popular in rococo porcelain and metalwork In Renaissance or neoclassical work they are normally thinner and straighter

The term may also be applied to spiraling stopfluting running up a classical column

Rue de la ChaussedAntin
This quartier of Paris got its name from the rue de la ChaussedAntin in the 9th arrondissement of Paris It runs northnorthwest from the Boulevard des Italiens to the glise de la SainteTrinit

In the 17th century the chemin des Porcherons crossed a swampy piece of ground north of the porte Gaillon a city gate in the wall built during the reign of Louis XIII leading to the village of Les Porcherons It is called a chausse because the marshy ground required raised construction that ran along the top of a sort of dyke

At the rue de Provence it crossed the great sewer or  which was approximately two meters wide

Under an ordinance dated 4 December 1720 the street was graded and resurveyed as a wider boulevard with a width of eight toises and extended to meet the grands boulevards to the south This new boulevard stretched from the end of to Rue SaintLazare

The frequent stays of Louis XV in Paris led to the building of splendid homes such as that of Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin the Duke of Antin 16651736 Son of the marquise de Montespan the duke was the superintendent of the Btiments du Roi or buildings of the king His residence faced this street and his name became associated with it as early as 1712

At the intersection of the Boulevard des Capucines stood the former htel de Montmorency which gave way to the Thtre du Vaudeville in 1869 and then the Paramount Opra cinema theater in 1927 The main hall of the theater corresponds to the grand salon  probably a ballroomof the 18thcentury htel The rotunda above the facade has been preserved

The notorious stood on the present site of the glise de la SainteTrinit It opened in 1724 and could accommodate 600 people for public festivities

At the intersection of the Boulevard des Italiens stood the barracks of the Gardes Franaises  a regiment of the royal guard which was to play a key role in the revolutionary events of July 1789 The barracks was built by the Duke of Biron in 1764 It gave the boulevard its name for some years On 12 July 1789 a platoon of the French Guards saved its colonel M Duchtelet from popular riots
The air was thought to be healthier to the north and west of Paris during the 18th century That and the higher ground attracted the upper classes A series of glamorous htels particuliers were erected along the ChaussedAntin in the later 18th century now destroyed 



In 1977 400 pieces of sculpture from the facade of the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris were found underground of the htel Moreau Especially heads of the kings of Judea During the French Revolution the statues were destroyed because people thought that they were statues of kings of France


During the 19th century commercial establishments changed the character of the street and shops opened in the ground floors of the old residences For Honor de Balzac The heart of Paris today beats between rue de la ChaussedAntin and rue du Faubourg Montmartre In 1840 the street was extended past  The first oneway streets in Paris were the Rue de Mogador and the Rue de la ChaussedAntin created on 13 December 1909

WirelessHD
WirelessHD also known as UltraGig is a proprietary standard owned by Silicon Image originally SiBeam for wireless transmission of highdefinition video content for consumer electronics products The consortium currently has over 40 adopters key members behind the specification include Broadcom Intel LG Panasonic NEC Samsung SiBEAM Sony Philips and Toshiba The founders intend the technology to be used for Consumer Electronic devices PCs and portable devices

The specification was finalized in January 2008

The WirelessHD specification is based on a 7GHz channel in the 60GHz Extremely High Frequency radio band It allows either lightly compressed proprietary wireless linkaware codec or uncompressed digital transmission of highdefinition video and audio and data signals essentially making it equivalent of a wireless HDMI Firstgeneration implementation achieves data rates from 4Gbits but the core technology allows theoretical data rates as high as 25Gbits compared to 102Gbits for HDMI 13 and 216Gbits for DisplayPort 12 permitting WirelessHD to scale to higher resolutions color depth and range The 11 version of the specification increases the maximum data rate to 28Gbits supports common 3D formats 4K resolution WPAN data lowpower mode for portable devices and HDCP 20 content protection

The 60GHz band usually requires line of sight between transmitter and receiver and the WirelessHD specification ameliorates this limitation through the use of beam forming at the receiver and transmitter antennas to increase the signals effective radiated power find the best path and utilise wall reflections The goal range for the first products will be inroom pointtopoint non lineofsight NLOS at up to 10 meters The atmospheric absorption of 60GHz energy by oxygen molecules limits undesired propagation over long distances and helps control intersystem interference and long distance reception which is a concern to video copyright owners

The WirelessHD specification has provisions for content encryption via Digital Transmission Content Protection DTCP as well as provisions for network management A standard remote control allows users to control the WirelessHD devices and choose which device will act as the source for the display

WirelessHD competes with WiGig in some applications WiGig transmits in the same 60GHz band used by WirelessHD

The Phantom Blooper
The Phantom Blooper A Novel of Vietnam is a 1990 novel written by Gustav HasfordThe Phantom Blooper A Novel of Vietnam 1990 and the sequel to The ShortTimers 1979 It continues to follow James T Joker Davis through his Vietnam odyssey The book was supposed to be the second of a Vietnam Trilogy but Hasford died before writing the third installment

The novel begins sometime after The ShortTimers leaves off and is divided into three parts

Having been demoted from Sergeant to Private Joker is still at the Khe Sanh base which is about to be abandoned by American Marines after withstanding a twomonth siege He believes most of his previous squadmates are dead even the seemingly indestructible Animal Mother Joker blames their deaths on The Phantom Blooper an elusive enemy supposedly American and armed with an M79 grenade launcher who fights alongside the Viet Cong against his countrymen

Joker is still haunted by the memory of his friend Cowboy who had been wounded and whom Joker mercykilled in order to keep their squad from being cut down by a sniper As a result Jokers behavior has become increasingly erratic and violent He sets up one of his squadmates to be killed in an attempt to draw the Phantom Blooper out of hiding then forces an inattentive Marine on guard duty to hold a live hand grenade with the pin out Later as the Viet Cong attempt to overrun the base Joker splits his platoon sergeants tongue with a straight razor

The Marines turn back the attack suffering heavy losses in the process The next night Joker ventures out in search of the Phantom Blooper but is wounded by friendly fire and captured by the enemy

Joker has been living and working in a small Viet Cong village for over a year since his capture waiting for a chance to escape He has not been tortured or sent to a POW camp and his captors have begun to trust him to some degree In Jokers mind his best chance is to fool them into believing he has converted to their cause to accompany them on an attack against an American position and then to make his escape when the shooting starts As time passes however he begins to side increasingly with the Viet Cong seeing them  the people he has been trained to kill  as ordinary human beings just like himself When a team of Army soldiers arrives to rescue him he is wounded in the ensuing firefight but manages to shoot down one of their choppers with a discarded M79 before passing out

Joker is sent to Yokosuka Naval Hospital in Japan for medical treatment and psychological counseling He quickly makes it clear that he does not regret any of his actions as a Viet Cong captive and he expresses his disgust and outrage at having been sent by his country to fight in a futile war Despite initial threats of a courtmartial for treason he is eventually given a Section 8 discharge and sent home to the United States

Upon arriving in California Joker finds that his squad radioman Donlon is alive attending college and protesting the war Animal Mother he also learns was captured by the Viet Cong but escaped from a POW camp he is still an active Marine Joker and Donlon attend a demonstration that is quickly and forcefully broken up by the police but Joker manages to slip away with the help of an exMarine cop who served with him at Khe Sanh Next Joker travels to Cowboys home in Kansas and has a brief and uneasy meeting with Cowboys parents Their sons body was never recovered from the jungle and Joker chooses not to tell them that he mercykilled Cowboy Finally Joker reaches his familys farm in Alabama all the while feeling a growing disillusionment with the war and America Deciding there is nothing left for him in the United States and realizing that he has become the Phantom Blooper he was once obsessed with stopping he sets out to return to Vietnam and his life among the Viet Cong villagers

This sequel made less of an impact than The ShortTimers 1979 which was the basis for the film Full Metal Jacket 1987 Some dialogue from The Phantom Blooper is also present in Full Metal Jacket Nonetheless The Phantom Blooper was highly regarded by reviewers Before Hasford died in 1993 he had planned to continue Jokers story in a third novel

According to the Official Gustav Hasford Website maintained by Hasfords cousin Jason Aaron The ShortTimers The Phantom Blooper A Novel of Vietnam and Hasfords third and last completed book a noir detective novel titled A Gypsy Good Time 1992 are currently out of print The texts of the two war novels and an excerpt of A Gypsy Good Time were publicly available at the website for at least a decade but the site has since been redesigned and Aaron who manages the site has stated he likely wont be reposting the novel there

Two of Swords
Two of Swords is a Minor Arcana tarot card
Tarot cards are used throughout much of Europe to play tarot card games

In Englishspeaking countries where the games are largely unknown Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for divinatory purposes

A female figure sits blindfolded as she calmly balances two swords across her shoulders Behind her is a large body of water and above her is the moon

The womans seated position in combination with the crescent moon recalls the High Priestess card and we find a link as well in this cards representation of the characteristic feminine strength of intuition The womans blindfold and the sea show a necessity to rely not on immediate stimuli but on deeper thoughts and feelings that part of the unconscious mind that we call our higher self

Her seated position when conceptually paired with the balanced swords and the blindfold may also recall the Justice card Yet here the concept of justice is not one of retribution but of making decisions that are balanced moral and that we trust to be harmonious within and without ourselves

Unlike the hoodwinked woman held captive on the Eight of Swords this card depicts a woman in control The scene and the discipline of her pose do more to suggest that she has placed the blindfold on herself as is done in many cultures ritualistically to encourage reliance on the other senses for example the use of blindfolds in martial arts 

The woman is blind in her situation but she is safe not only unafraid but centered She wields powerful weapons but they are not held in a position that is threatening to her or anyone else The moon and the sea reinforce this sense of calm and equanimity

This is a card of meditation not of action The crossed swords point to different possible directions but for the moment the character is looking inward rather than outward and in the possession of an awesome power that protects her until she finds the direction to apply it

Napa Valley AVA
Napa Valley AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in Napa County in Californias Wine Country Napa Valley is considered one of the premier wine regions in the world Records of commercial wine production in the region date back to the nineteenth century but premium wine production dates back only to the 1960s

The combination of Mediterranean climate geography and geology of the region are conducive to growing quality wine grapes John Patchett established the Napa Valleys first commercial vineyard in 1858 In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valleys first commercial wineries in St Helena Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera the institution of Prohibition and the Great Depression The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered and helped by the results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 came to be seen as capable of producing the best quality wine  equal to that of Old World wine regions Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination

The valley floor is flanked by the Mayacamas Mountain Range on the western and northern sides the Vaca Mountains on the eastern side Several smaller valleys exist within these two ranges The floor of the main valley gradually rises from sea level at the southern end to above sea level at the northern end in Calistoga at the foot of Mount Saint Helena The Oakville and Rutherford American Viticultural Areas AVAs lie within a geographical area known as the Rutherford Bench in the center of the valley floor The soil in the southern end of the valley consists mainly of sediments deposited by earlier advances and retreats of San Pablo Bay while the soil at the northern end of the valley contains a large volume of volcanic lava and ash Several of the small hills that emerge from the middle of the valley floor near Yountville are indicators of the regions volcanic past

Several mesoclimates exist within the area due to various weather and geographical influences The open southern end of the valley floor is cooler during the growing season due to the proximity of San Pablo Bay while the sheltered closed northern end is often much warmer The eastern side of the valley tends to be more arid because winter storms tend to drop much more precipitation on the western mountains and hills

Early pioneer and settler George C Yount is generally credited to have been the first to grow grapes in the Napa Valley In 1864 on the marriage of one of his granddaughters to Thomas Rutherford Yount gave the couple around of land which Rutherford dedicated to winemaking

Commercial production started in 1858 with John Patchett selling wine for 2 per gallon His wine cellar built in 1859 narrowly predates that established in 1861 in St Helena by Charles Krug although this is commonly cited as the Napa Valleys first winery

Captain Gustave Niebaum established Inglenook Winery in 1879 near the village of Rutherford This was the first Bordeaux style winery in the USA Inglenook wines won gold medals at the 1889 Worlds Fair in Paris

In 1868 H W Crabb bought land near Oakville close to the Napa River Crabb established a vineyard and winery named To Kalon and by 1877 had planted and was producing 50000 US gallons of wine per year Crabb experimented with over 400 grape varieties to find the types best suited for the area

By the end of the nineteenth century there were more than one hundred and forty wineries in the area Of those original wineries several still exist in the valley today including Beaulieu Beringer Charles Krug Chateau Montelena Far Niente Mayacamas Markham Vineyards and Schramsberg Vineyards

Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries The Phylloxera louse killed many of the vines throughout the valley Prohibition enacted in 1920 caused many wineries to shut down A few remained open with agreements to produce sacramental wine Growers who elected to keep their vines planted sold their crops to home winemakers The Great Depression slowed the wine business further These events stalled the growth of the wine industry in Napa County California for years

Andr Tchelistcheff is generally credited with ushering in the modern era of winemaking in California Beaulieu hired Tchelisticheff in 1938 He introduced several techniques and procedures to the region such as aging wine in small French Oak barrels cold fermentation vineyard frost prevention and malolactic fermentation
Following Prohibition Beringer Vineyards invited attendees of the Golden Gate International Exposition to visit the winery using promotional maps printed with the phrase All roads lead to Beringer in 1939 The winery also invited Hollywood stars including Clark Gable Charles Laughton and Carole Lombard to visit These early promotions are considered to be the birth of winebased tourism that is now a large part of the economy of Napa Valley today

Brother Timothy of Christian Brothers winery was also instrumental in establishing the modern wine industry in Napa After an earlier career as a teacher he transferred to the orders Mont La Salle located on Mount Veeder in the Mayacamas Mountains northwest of Napa in 1935 to become the wine chemist for the orders expanding wine operations Christian Brothers had grown grapes and made sacramental wine in Benicia California during Prohibition but decided to branch out into commercial production of wine and brandy after the repeal of Prohibition The science teacher was a fast learner and soon established Christian Brothers as one of the leading brands in the states budding wine industry Brother Timothys smiling face in advertisements and promotional materials became one of the most familiar images for wine consumers across the country Following the Second World War the wine industry in Napa began to thrive again

In 1965 Napa Valley icon Robert Mondavi broke away from his familys Charles Krug estate to found his own winemaking operation in Oakville It was the first new large scale winery to be established in the valley since prohibition and included the original To Kalon land After this the number of wineries in the valley grew rapidly as did the regions reputation

In 1976 the region got a boost from the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976 which featured a Napa Valley Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon besting several famous French labels in a blind tasting format The results of this tasting cemented the regions reputation as a producer of world class wines

A modern outbreak of phylloxera was discovered in the valley in 1983 in a vineyard planted with AxR1 rootstock Many growers seized upon this outbreak as an opportunity to switch to varieties that were better suited to the climate and soil By the late 1990s nearly 75 of the affected vineyards had been replanted with phylloxera resistant rootstock The growers in the region are currently channeling their energy to battle the Glassywinged sharpshooter a nonnative pest that carries Pierces disease

A trend of larger national and international companies like E  J Gallo Winery Diageo and Constellation Brands buying smaller wineries vineyards and brands began to gain momentum in the early part of the 21st century Today Napa Valley features more than 450 wineries that grow grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon Chardonnay Pinot noir Merlot Zinfandel among others While winemakers may produce wines from specific AVAs within the valley many wines are made as a blend from grapes grown on the valley floor and the surrounding hillsides 

Almost 45 million people visit Napa Valley each year making it a very popular tourist destination in California and The Worlds Best Wine and Food Destination as awarded by TripAdvisors 2010 Travelers Choice Awards

Within the Napa Valley AVA there are sixteen subAVAs
