Royal Albert Hall Organ
The Grand Organ situated in the Royal Albert Hall in London is the second largest pipe organ in the United Kingdom It was originally built by Henry Father Willis and most recently rebuilt by Mander Organs having 147 stops and 9997 speaking pipes

The original organ was built by Henry Willis  Sons in 1871 It had four manuals and 111 stops and was at that time the largest in the world

The Durham firm of Harrison  Harrison rebuilt the organ in two stages in 1924 and 1933 during which it was increased to 146 stops including three percussion stops and converted to electropneumatic action It was still the largest organ in Britain at that time The 2014 Pink Floyd album The Endless River includes a track Autumn 68 featuring a recording of band member Richard Wright playing the organ in 1969

In the 1970s Harrisons refurbished the console and replaced the switchgear in the action made minor changes to the voicing and added a roof to attempt to project the sound forward which was not successful One interesting note in this period is that composer Wendy Carlos featured the organ during the closing title sequence of the 1982 Disney science fiction film Tron performed by organist Martin Neary

By the end of the 20th century the organ was again in a state of disrepair with an everincreasing number of stops unusable due to leaks in the wind system cracks in the soundboards and other problems By 2002 it was maintained only through heroic efforts on the part of Harrisons and could not be used at all without their staff present in case of mishap The wind chests and pipes were leaking noisily and wind pressure was insufficient to support full use The leatherwork in the actions was also failing

In 2002 the organ was taken out of commission for an extensive rebuild by Mander Organs Some consideration was given to restoring the organ to its original Willis specification but the subsequent alterations and enlargements had made this impractical The organ was by now in truth a Harrison not a Willis instrument and it was felt that it should remain essentially asis

The dryness of the Hall had damaged the soundboards so these were replaced and new and larger wind trunks provided The roof was removed and the reed stops in the Great division were restored to their 1924 wind pressures The 1970s split of the Great Organ allowing two independent Great Organs to be registered and played simultaneously on different manuals was rationalised effectively offering separate Willis and Harrison choruses also a FournitureIV was added bringing the total to 147 stops and 9997 speaking pipes For a few years the organ was once again the largest in the UK until in 2007 the distinction passed to the organ in Liverpool Anglican Cathedral 10268 pipes

The organ was reopened at a gala concert on the evening of 26 June 2004 with David Briggs John Scott and Thomas Trotter playing with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Richard Hickox The organ featured prominently in the 2004 BBC Proms series The first recordings on the newly rebuilt instrument were by Dame Gillian Weir The instrument has also been used by progressive rock band Muse when playing Megalomania originally recorded on another Willis organ at the church of Saint Mary in Bathwick During a live performance at the Royal Albert Hall on the 12 April 2008 Muses frontman Matt Bellamy had commented that since were here it would be rude not to play this beast

There are three public elementary schools in the area Forest Glade Public School Parkview Public School and Eastwood Public School In addition to these there are two Catholic school board schools LA Desmarais and HJ Lassaline

Housing in Forest Glade generally consists of freestanding single family homes owned as opposed to rented There are a number of apartment buildings but the majority of the population of the area live in houses Numerous churches and religious places are present in the community A shopping plaza or small strip mall is located near the Community Centre

Although Forest Glade or simply The Glade is an official part of the City of Windsor many residents show a sense of patriotism that would suggest it were an independent town

Forest Glade is well known amongst Windsorites for having many winding and confusing roads It is very easy to get lost in Forest Glade as there are lots of crescents and some of the streets even intersect themselves Numerous crescenttype streets are renamed halfway along them making navigation for people unfamiliar with the area difficult at best

The community is an example of a planned community as until the late 1960s the area was mainly farmland with fewer than a dozen houses in the area The community was built in stages throughout the 1960s 1970s and 1980s with most of the available land between the road boundaries being used The most recent expansion is in the North East corner constructing new houses near Banwell Road

Alfred Taylor Howard
Alfred Taylor Howard born 12 March 1868 was a Bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ elected in 1913

Alfred was born in the rural community of Pleasant Valley Prairie Ronde Township near the town of Schoolcraft Kalamazoo County Michigan His is the story of a farm boy who responded to the call of the far horizon to become a world citizen and a Christian witness to the uttermost part of the earth

The Pleasant Valley neighborhood though a tiny dot on the map was in fact singularly cosmopolitan Early settlers had come from many eastern States and some directly from England the Netherlands and Germany This diversity may have placed in this boys mind the idea of the bigness of the world

Alfred was the son of Cornelius Howard who was born in Michigan in 1841 His mother was Harriett Guilford Alfreds paternal grandfather was of English lineage arriving in Michigan from White Plains New York His paternal grandmother was Margaret Osterhut of Dutch descent

Cornelius was deeply involved and powerfully loyal to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ He was a frequent lay member to the St Joseph Annual Conference twice to the General Conference and served for ten years as a Trustee of Otterbein College Harriett Howard was likewise devoted if unobtrusive in her religious expression As a boy Alfred was uplifted by the sound of his mothers voice raised in prayer as she went about her housework

Alfreds favorite reading in boyhood was the Youths Companion a weekly magazine for young people filled with hairraising tales of Indian fights on the frontier As a man Alfred expressed regret that those exciting stories always assumed the Indians had no rights on the land where they were reared and on which their ancestors had lived for generations

Alfred attended country school then the Schoolcraft High School four miles from his home His favorite high school subject was physical geography He also enjoyed physiology which prompted in him for many years the desire to study medicine At the age of eighteen he taught school one year in his neighborhood The next year he taught near Davenport Nebraska

Young Alfred was often encouraged to attend college One of his encouragers was his pastor the Rev J L Parks Thus it was decided that Alfred should attend Roanoke Classical Seminary in Indiana The Principal was Professor D N Howe a graduate of Otterbein and of the Union Biblical Seminary in Dayton Ohio now United Theological Seminary Alfred enjoyed these college preparatory studies under Professor Howe After this one year however because the Roanoke Seminary moved to North Manchester Indiana Alfred decided to attend Otterbein in Westerville Ohio

The autumn of 1889 found Alfred Howard at the age of twentyone enrolled in the academy of Otterbein College One year later he matriculated to the college itself His days at Otterbein were happy ones and he never tired in later years of relating his college memories Alfred was an earnest student with a mind thirsty for truth a characteristic he retained the rest of his life Nevertheless bad eyesight severely handicapped him and he had great difficulty getting glasses which fit properly

Heredity and an active farm upbringing gave Alfred a powerful physique In college he played varsity football alternating between center and guard Frequently he was pivot man in the famous flying wedge

Alfred sang first tenor in the Otterbein Quartet the first of a series of such organizations in the history of the college On one occasion the quartet sang at the church of W W Williamson who had a son John The latter was fascinated by the singing collegians and vowed to also some day go to Otterbein and sing in the quartet In due time John Finley Williamson did both and much more than that He continued his musical interests after graduation organizing a choir and a choir school founding the Westminster Choir College in Dayton Ohio presently in Princeton New Jersey which became world famous

One year Alfred directed the Presbyterian Church choir in Marion Ohio traveling from Otterbein each weekend The pastor was a Rev Mr Thomas whose young son Norman became well acquainted with Alfred Later Norman Thomas also became a Presbyterian minister but is better known as the frequent candidate for President of the United States on the Socialist ticket

The Young Mens Christian Association on the Otterbein campus made a rich contribution to Alfred Howards life S D Gordon was state secretary of college YMCA work in Ohio at that time and John R Mott and Robert E Speer young men just out of Cornell and Princeton respectively were frequent speakers at YMCA conferences

In 1890 at one such conference John R Mott made an address which engraved three unforgotten sentences on young Howards mind
One summer Alfred even attended the famous college YMCA conference at Northfield Massachusetts

Howard met May Day Stevenson at Otterbein They conducted their courtship on the campus but he proposed to her one summer by letter

Alfred and May were married on their graduation day 15 June 1894 in the home of Professor Henry Garst who performed the ceremony in the presence of many college friends Soon thereafter the happy couple were on the high seas sailing for the mission field in Africa

Alfred Taylor Howard was deeply religious He believed profoundly in the efficacy of prayer As a boy he had formed the habit of prayer and as a college student prayed regularly In later life while taking long walks he would pray for long lists of persons and causes setting aside certain days of the week for various portions of his long prayer lists

Toward the end of his college days Alfred wondered about what his lifework should be So he made this a matter for prayer During the summer before his senior year while working on his fathers farm he chose a certain empty stall in the barn as his quiet place for daily intercession Later he wrote I do not know when in my life I ever prayed more earnestly for definite guidance

In his handwritten memoirs found after his death he tells of the outcome of his prayer

Lyonclass battleship
The Lyon class was a proposed battleship class which was planned for the French Navy in 1913 with construction scheduled to begin in 1915 The class was to have comprised four ships Lyon Lille Duquesne and Tourville The first two were named for cities in France while the rest honored French admirals Abraham Duquesne and Anne Hilarion de Tourville The design was an improvement on the previous  and mounted a fourth quadruplegun turret for a total of sixteen guns Construction was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 before any of the ships could be laid down

Starting in 1910 the French Navy began a dreadnought battleship construction program starting with the four ships of the that year The threeship was authorized the next year and five s followed in 1912 Design work began in 1912 the design staff submitted several proposals for the new battleships Displacements ranged from to  the various designs featured a main battery of fourteen or sixteen guns eight or ten guns or twenty guns in a mix of quadruple or twin gun turrets

In 1913 the Navy authorized a fourth class of battleships Lyon which was scheduled for 1915 The design staff determined the 38cm gun would take too long to design so the proposals that incorporated these weapons were cancelled The design staff settled on one of the two 34cm proposals The first proposal which mounted fourteen guns was a ship long On 24 November 1913 the design staff instead chose the slightly larger second design armed with sixteen guns in four quadruple turrets The first two ships Lyon and Lille were scheduled to be ordered on 1 January 1915 and Duquesne and Tourville would have followed on 1 April 1915 World War I broke out in August 1914 however and shifting military requirements particularly for the army forced the cancellation of the class

Rhinophoridae is a family of flies Diptera found in all zoogeographic regions except Australasia and Oceania but mainly in the Palaearctic and Afrotropical regions

They are small slender black bristly flies phylogenetically close to the Tachinidae although some authors consider them a sister group of te Calliphoridae The larvae are mostly parasitoids of woodlice beetles spiders and other arthropods and occasionally snails

By 2014 about 23 genera were placed in the family with a total of about 150 species More are being described occasionally

Dharpa
Dharpa aka Dharpa Chuharpur is a village in Khurja Tehsil in Bulandshahr District of Uttar Pradesh in northern India It is situated on the Grand Trunk Road between Bulandshahr and Khurja This village is 14km away from Bulandshahr SouthEast and 5km away from Khurja NorthWest

The village is one of the 5 Tomar Rajput villages of Tomar Tanwar Rajputs The other Rajput clans in this village are Jadaun or Jadon along with one Chauhan family People of various other castes along with few Muslim families also live in the village

There are 3 government schools
1 Primary School
2 Grirls Junior High School
3 Janta Vidyalaya High School  Dharpa Achchheja
For higher studies after high school the students need to go to Khurja where there are 3 main Inter Colleges along with a degree colleague under Chaudhary Charan Singh University aka Meerut University Recently village students have also got other options of private or public schools in Khurja and nearby places It is very unfortunate and sad that there are not many students who are academically doing good in the village This is because of the deteriorating condition of state government schools

The import thing is that the villagers put a lot of importance on the education of girls which is a very good sign for the whole society It has been noticed in the recent past that sometimes girls academic performance is better than boys and a number of girls are pursuing higher education A fact worth mentioning is that few families have moved to nearby town just for their daughters higher education as there is no degree college in the vicinity

There is One BAMS College has opened in this village and people come from outside to complete their study Which is very good news about the village and its peopleIt is about to open a degree college in this village very soon

There is a Language School is about to open where students of this village and around could take the advantage of this

The village has a post office The PIN code of this village is 203131

The village comes under KhurjaDehat Rural police station which is situated just 2km away toward SouthWest from village across GT Road The good thing is that the village has notices less crime The village people live in peace and harmony except few very small rare cases of crime or violence

In the recent past a number of shops have opened by villagers on the road which has emerged as a market No villagers get all the household items from these shops There are various shops on the road market such tailor salons confectionery medical stores grocery and stationery puncture fixing cyclescootermotor cycle repairing STD booths carpenter flour mill electronics gadgets repairing etc This small market also serves the needs of other nearby villages

The main source of income for majority of people if agriculture The main crops are sugarcane wheat and paddy anlog with cash crops The water from canal is a main source of irrigation The well known Upper Ganga Canal passes through the village periphery There are couple of tube wells as well In case of shortage of canals water or electricity sometimes the farmers are compelled to use ground water pumped using diesel engines which becomes a very costly affair

The village low income population is also dependent on the industries around the village like potteries dairy and iron rods fabrication factory The figure of government employees in the village is not very encouraging There are few village people who have got employment in private sector

In the search of employment the village people migrate to nearby towns and New Delhi

Roseville Bridge
The Roseville Bridge a concrete box girder bridge located adjacent to the suburb of  crosses the Middle Harbour in Sydney New South Wales Australia The bridge carries Warringah Road part of the A38 and is one of two crossings of Middle Harbour inclusive of the Spit Bridge 

The bridge is long has a clearance of from the water below However the adjacent Pipe Bridge has a clearance of only  This limitation combined with only depth of water make it out of reach for most cruising vessels

An original bridge across Middle Harbour at Roseville was built jointly by the Willoughby Kuringgai and Warringah councils It was built of reinforced concrete by unemployed returned servicemen and opened on 20 September 1924 It was claimed to be the longest bridge of that type in NSW although the bridge across the Hawkesbury River at was longer It was claimed to be the first bridge supported on reinforced concrete piles This lowlevel twolane bridge was located downstream of the current bridge and connected Babbage Road to what is today called Healey Way which is the entrance to Davidson Park within Garigal National Park The first bridge replaced an earlier ferry service consisting of rowing boats across the narrowest section of water

The suburbs east of Middle Harbour grew rapidly in the years following the opening of Roseville Bridge and on 2 April 1966 the Liberal Premier Robin Askin the Member for Collaroy at the time later the Member for Pittwater opened the current sixlane highlevel bridge Along with the bridge a significant upgrade of the approach roads was completed which became the sixlane Warringah Road This upgraded section of road is about long

The 1924 bridge survived the opening of the new bridge and provided pedestrian access only until it was demolished in 1974 along with Roseville Baths Almost nothing remains from these structures

Today Roseville Bridge is part of a major thoroughfare from the Pacific Highway at Roseville to the Northern Beaches and suburbs east of Middle Harbour Due to the halt of the construction of the Warringah Expressway across Middle Harbour to Wakehurst Parkway and the Burnt Bridge Creek Deviation which is the only part of the Warringah Expressway built on the Northern Beaches by the Labor Wran government there are today only two other major roads to these areas Mona Vale Road and Spit Road which crosses Middle Harbour downstream from Roseville Bridge using the Spit Bridge

<doc id="7712308" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712308" title="Parnassius">
Parnassius
Parnassius is a genus of northern circumpolar and montane alpine and Himalayan butterflies usually known as Apollos or snow Apollos They can vary in colour and form significantly based on their altitude They also show an adaptation to high altitudes called altitudinal melanism They show dark bodies and darkened colouration at the wingbase which helps them warm faster using the sun

Although classified under the swallowtail butterfly family none of the Parnassius species possesses tails

The larvae feed on species of plants belonging to the Papaveraceae and Crassulaceae families and like the other swallowtail butterfly larvae possess an osmeterium Unlike most butterflies that have exposed pupae they pupate inside a loose silken cocoon

Parnassius species of butterflies are often hard to identify and can sometimes only be identified by dissection of the genitalia
The phylogeny of the group is still under study using molecular techniques The exact number of species within the genus is disputed and numbers range from 38 to 47

The Parnassius butterflies also have a peculiar reproductive strategy in that the male has special accessory glands that produce a mating plug that seals the female genitalia after mating This is believed to ensure the success of the male and to prevent other males from mating and avoids sperm competition

Butterflies of this genus have been widely used models to study metapopulations population genetics and gene flow Their patchy distribution and restricted migration makes them vulnerable to the effects of genetic drift and considerable colour variations can exist in individuals from different regions

Species include

Eight subgenera are recognized within the genus
Other names that are no longer valid include

A molecular phylogenetic study from 2008 suggests firstly that Baronia brevicornis Salvin 1893 rather than belonging to an outgroup Baroniinae belongs to Parnassiini together with Hypermnestra and Parnassius Secondly that the earliest split within the genus Parnassius is between subgenus Parnassius the apollo group whose caterpillars feed on Crassulaceae exceptionally Saxifragaceae and the ancestor of the remaining seven subgenera The existence of the subgenera is confirmed by molecular phylogenies Six of the other subgenera have Fumariaceae as the larval food plant while the larvae of the remaining genus Kreizbergia feed on Scrophulariaceae

Chappel
Chappel is a village and civil parish in the borough of Colchester Essex which sits on the River Colne It is significant for its Victorian viaduct which crosses the Colne valley

The present name of Chappel derives from the construction of a small chapel of ease noted in 1285AD as standing at the northern boundary of the parish of Great Tey During the 16th century because of concerns from Chappel residents about the distance to Great Teys own church at festival time this area was split from the parish and become a separate entity known as Pontisbright lit Britrics bridge that would eventually become known as Chappel

In 1433 the vicar of Great Tey agreed that the inhabitants of Chappel could find and elect their own chaplain The benefice itself was united with that of the neighbouring village of Wakes Colne in 1938 The chapel itself now the parish church of St Barnabas is a grade I listed building

The Chappel viaduct was built between 1847 and 1849 for the Colchester and Stour extension of the Eastern Counties Railway Originally planned to be a timber structure the viaduct was built of locally made brick because of the additional cost of maintaining a timber structure Approximately 600 men were involved in the construction most of whom were local East Anglians The cost of construction was approximately 21000 approximately 22 million in 2016 money

The viaduct consists of 32 arches of span with a total length of  and a maximum height of  The piers consist of two shafts separated by a opening and joined at top and bottom by arches each shaft contain a hollow void by maximum partially filled with concrete to the level of the bottom arch The running level of the viaduct has a gradient of 1 in 120

The viaduct became a listed monument in 1967 and is thought to be the secondlargest brickbuilt structure in England after Battersea Power Station

During the commemoration events to mark 50 years since the end of the Second World War Chappels beacon was transported by rail to a point on the viaduct where it could be seen from the playing field below and lit after a ceremonial silence the beginning and end of which were marked by the release of two maroons

Sywnthkrawft
Sywnthkrawft is a synth group from Borlnge Sweden They started playing in 2005 and have released 1 album 3 singles and 2 livealbums Their music have been described to sound like electronic spaceromance and ambient movie score music but theyve changed genre to more synth oriented music

Some artists that have inspired the music of Sywnthkrawft are Kraftwerk Depeche Mode and Ralph Lundsten

William Johansson Daniel Thyberg Gustav Jacobsson and Viktor Jacobsson created the band in the summer of 2005 after long discussions of starting a band The first recordings were of a session of improvised playing Three songs were recorded from this session Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht Das berman Ist Spt and Der Kalinka

After some sessions of only improvised music William Johansson and Daniel Thyberg started to write and record songs Later some of these songs would feature on their first album Cornea One of these songs called Approaching Atmosphere was considered to be released on single The band even recorded a music video to the track one problem was that only three of the four members were featured in the video which made some confusion of their lineup

After some recording sessions the band was ready to release their first album called Die Autobahn auf Earth But the material was to badly recorded most of the tracks were recorded live in the studio with only a microphone in the middle and then the idea of releasing this material was turned down But it would later turn out that most of these songs ended up on their soon to come album Cornea but then rerecorded and remade

A video where Sywnthkrawft played most materials live in their studio was recorded This video footage was later destroyed and cannot be restored again The only known songs that were recorded on the video was Approaching Atmosphere Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht Making Adjustments Space and Armageddon Apocalypse which is the only song whom could be restored from the destroyed footage

In the beginning of 2006 William Johansson decided to review the recorded material from the previous year and decided to remake the best songs So the band gathered again to rerecord their old songs with much better equipment than before The sound became much more atmospheric and ambient than before The old single Approaching Atmosphere would become one of the opening tracks of the album The recordings took almost three months to become ready It also took another month to get everything mastered by Geoff Swartz The album was going to be called Cornea

The album got a pretty neutral reception from the critics Some called the music electronic spaceromance and surreal ambient and some kind of electronica The epic track Night Flight and SAZA were considered to be the best songs on the album while Children was considered to be the worst song by far

Following the release of the album a live show was about to take place A lot of songs were rehearsed and not only songs from the new album but also other songs even old tracks from the first recording sessions William Johansson and Daniel Thyberg even wrote lyrics to some of their songs The ones that got lyrics were The Greeting Extermination Das Piraten auf der Mondlicht and Grace from Space the two mentioned first were two tracks from the early days of Sywnthkrawft There were also rumours that the controversial song Afrika was rehearsed but thats not confirmed

At the time of the concert only one in the band William had a keyboard so Gustav Jacobsson and Viktor Jacobsson had to borrow two keyboards while Daniel Thyberg played electric guitar The concert didnt go very good mostly because of technical problems The critics said that the concert were horrible and a waste of time The positive response were that the songs who were from the album Cornea were heavily rearranged and that the new songs were pretty decent The best received track was a new song called Hypernova

Another problem according to the band was that their songs were to long and monotonous The well received songs were those who are not featured on the album The same day a livealbum called Chaos at Caoz was released in very few numbers and is almost impossible to find today Also a new single was released Making Adjustments A new music video was made and the bside was the live performance of Hypernova The single got a very cold reception because the critics didnt want Sywnthkrawft to succeed after their horrible concert

They went back into the studio and recorded some songs most notably Spaceblades Rings of Saturn and a remake of an old song from one of the first session recordings called Paul Newman A setlist were also made for a new concert where the most notably material was a new version of Night Flight and a new song called Saguaroxx After these recordings and the concert the band withdrew and stopped making music for a while

After a time of absence William and Daniel came together and tried to write some new songs but only came up with one Erecto Plasma Later William wrote some new songs himself but also revived some of the songs they recorded before their withdrawal A new EP was made of five songs But this EP was never released and William went back to the studio to write more songs

After an absence Daniel decided to leave the group But William Gustav and Viktor kept playing and creating new music The group decided to release a new album called Goodbye Spaceblade and they started to create more tracks One of these tracks The Photographers Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind was released as a single and gained some fame and controversy

Later they competed in a competition called Garagerocken 2006 where they ended tied for 4th place A live album of the show was released Tuxedo Junction The new studio album was supposed to be released in late 2006 but after problems with finding a producer the release had to be postponed to May 2007 The style of music was a huge step away from their latest album Cornea All of the songs on the new album are written by William Johansson

At the beginning of 2007 they competed in Musik Direkt where a jury didnt qualify them to the final After the announcement the audience showed their dissatisfaction of the result by sending mails to the arrangers and complaining on different forums on the Internet Many thought they shouldve got a wild card to the final

They gained some fame  controversy for their single The Photographers Exceptional Pictures for Body and Mind On 8 March 2007 it debuted on 1 in the Swedish chart Dalatoppen Theyre known for playing a mix of nonalbum songs and songs featured on different releases on their live concerts They also use an exclusive prerecorded text read by radio and television celebrity Hans Villius as introduction to their concerts

During the summer of 2007 theyve decided to take a twomonth break from performing and instead William has started to work with remakes of all the songs they used to perform live Rumors say that all the songs on Goodbye Spaceblade were remade and might end up as an album William has also started to work on new material for a new Sywnthkrawft album with the working title SK3 The Space Musical

Pope Benedict XVI and Islam
During his papal tenure Pope Benedict XVI focused on building on the outreach of his predecessors towards Islam particularly on the efforts of Pope John Paul II who experts say established trust and opened opportunities for dialogue with Muslims One of the important milestones in the Popes efforts included a religious and peaceful initiative called A Common Word This was provoked by an illconceived 2006 lecture he delivered at a university in Regensburg Germany which prompted Muslim leaders to gather and make overtures to their Christian and Jewish counterparts Later on Pope Benedict pursued key initiatives that helped foster Christian and Muslim dialogue These were founded on the Popes belief that Christians and Muslims have shared religious experience and that Christianity and Islam are both theologically founded in Gods irruptive call  heard in the midst of mans ordinary daily existence

The Pope strongly condemned the Mohammed cartoons first published by a Danish newspaper and later in other European papers saying In the international context we are living at present the Catholic Church continues convinced that to foster peace and understanding between peoples and men it is necessary and urgent that religions and their symbols be respected He also added that this implies that believers of various religions not be the object of provocations that wound their lives and religious sentiments Pope Benedict XVI noted that for believers as for all people of good will the only path that can lead to peace and fraternity is respect for the convictions and religious practices of others

Pope Benedict XVI has called for Christians as to open their arms and hearts to Muslim immigrants and to dialogue with them on religious issues The Pope told participants that the Catholic Church is increasingly aware that interreligious dialogue is a part of its commitment to the service of humanity in the modern world In fact this conviction has become the daily bread of those who work with migrants refugees and itinerant peoples he said Pope Benedict described this dialogue between Christians and Muslims as important and delicate Many communities have experienced this he said as they worked to build relations of mutual knowledge and respect with Muslim immigrants which are extremely useful in overcoming prejudices and closed minds For this reason he added Christians are called to open their arms and hearts to everyone whatever their country of origin leaving the task of formulating appropriate laws for the promotion of healthy existence to the authorities responsible for public life

On September 11 2006 the leaders of Muslim communities in Italy endorsed statements by Pope Benedict XVI who warned that Africa and Asia feel threatened by the Wests materialism and secularism We agree with the Pope said Roberto Piccardo the spokesman of Italys largest Muslim group UCOII It is true that Muslims are puzzled by a West which is hostage to a materialistic system Mario Scialoja the former president of the World Muslim League also expressed support for the popes words saying that the Wests exclusion of God leads to the wrong life models On October 21 the Vatican for the first time released a document in Arabic a speech of the Vatican UNESCO representative which addresses scientific and ethical issues The next day the Pope sent his cordial greetings to Muslims as they celebrated the ending of the holy month of Ramadan I am happy to send cordial greetings to Muslims around the world who are these days celebrating the end of the Ramadan fasting month said the Pope at the VaticanI send them all my wishes for serenity and peace he added 

The October 2006 edition of La Civilt Cattolica  the authoritative magazine of the Rome Jesuits printed with the supervision and authorization of the Vatican authorities  opened with an editorial on Islam that furnished a very detailed and alarming description of fundamentalist and terrorist Islam behind which there are great and powerful Islamic states an Islam aiming at the conquest of the world and fostered by violence for the cause of Allah But it does this without even the slightest note of criticism of this nexus of violence and faith And it is as if this nexus were an inescapable reality against which the West and the Church should do little or nothing little at the practical level  its enough to look over the scant measures against terrorism that are recommended  and nothing at the theoretical level For its part the editorial seems to say that Islam is the way it is and must be accepted as such 

On November 10 2006 Pope Benedict urged his fellow German Catholics to discuss their faith in Jesus Christ openly with the Muslims living there The Pontiff said the Roman Catholic Church viewed Muslims with respect and good will They mostly hold on to their religious convictions and rites with great seriousness and have a right to see our humble and strong witness for Jesus Christ he said after noting that modern German society had been largely secularized To do this convincingly we need to make serious efforts So wherever there are many Muslims there should be Catholics with sufficient knowledge of languages and Church history to enable them to talk with Muslims The same month the Pope received in audience an Algerian Muslim philosopher known for his commitment to battling religious hatred I was impressed by his welcome and attention face to face Mustapha Cherif an expert on Islam at the University of Algiers told the Zenit News Service The Pope said dialogue among Christians Muslims and Jews was vital and urged Christians in the Middle East not to abandon the region Interreligious and intercultural dialogue is not just an option but a vital necessity for our times he told members of a foundation on interreligious dialogue Christians needed to find the ties that unite them with the worlds other two great monotheistic religions

Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said in an interview in an Italian newspaper that the Pontifical Council for InterReligious Dialogue which specializes in relations with Muslims would be made a separate office and no longer merged with the Vaticans cultural office

The head of the Vaticans Pontifical Council for Interfaith Dialogue said on March 26 2006 that the war in Iraq should not be viewed as a crusade launched by Christian countries against Muslims and that Western was not synonymous to Christian Pope Benedict XVI like his predecessor John Paul II never ceases to say this and show it by his acts such as opposition to armed intervention in Iraq He said that the church is not western but catholic

Pope Benedict XVI condemned preemptive war It was the Popes view that the invasion of Iraq has no moral justification As a cardinal Benedict was critical about President George W Bushs choice of sending an army into the heart of Islam to impose democracy The damage would be greater than the values one hopes to save he concluded He also said that The concept of preventive war does not appear in The Catechism of the Catholic Church

The Vatican condemned the execution of Saddam Hussein as a tragic event and warned that it risked fomenting a spirit of vendetta and sowing fresh violence in Iraq A capital punishment is always tragic news a reason for sadness even if it deals with a person who was guilty of grave crimes said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi The position of the Church against capital punishment has been restated often he said The killing of the guilty party is not the way to reconstruct justice and reconcile society On the contrary there is a risk that it will feed a spirit of vendetta and sow new violence he said

At Easter Pope Benedict XVI lamented the continual slaughter in Iraq and unrest in Afghanistan as he denounced violence in the name of religion 
Afghanistan is marked by growing unrest and instability Benedict said In the Middle East besides some signs of hope in the dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority unfortunately nothing positive comes from Iraq torn apart by continual slaughter as the civil population flees

Pope Benedict XVI in his first Easter message on April 16 2006 called for a peaceful solution in the nuclear standoff with Iran saying Concerning the international crises linked to nuclear power may an honorable solution be found for all parties through serious and honest negotiations Tony Blair was granted a private audience with the Pope in June at the Vatican at the end of a weeklong trip to Italy The Pope told the Prime Minister to pursue diplomatic solutions to problems with states in the Middle East including Iran A Vatican spokesman said The Pope did stress that diplomacy and not conflict was the best way forward The two leaders also discussed how moderate voices from the worlds main religions need to work together to tackle extremism and reduce the risk of terrorism

German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the Middle East and Iran with Pope Benedict in a private audience in August 2006 She came out of her hourlong audience saying it was a very impressive experience We had a very intense exchange on world politics especially on the Middle East but also on how the international community should deal with Iran Pope Benedict has been contacted by Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Tehran faces international isolation for its nuclear program

The following month Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed respect for Pope Benedict XVI and said the pontiff had modified his remarks that offended Muslims worldwideWe respect the Pope and all those interested in peace and justice Ahmadinejad told a news conference before departing for Venezuela I understand that he has modified the remarks he made

The Pope met Irans Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki in December and called for dialogue to overcome conflicts in an apparent reference to Tehrans standoff with the West over its atomic programme The Vatican said in a statement that the Pope exchanged warm wishes with MottakiThe problems of people are always resolved through dialogue mutual comprehension and in peace the Vatican said Mottaki during a private audience with the leader of the worlds 1000 million Roman Catholics delivered a letter to the Pope from Ahmadinejad The message is completely nonpolitical Ehsan Jahandideh a presidential office spokesman was quoted as saying by Irans ISNA students news agencyThe president has emphasised in the message that cooperation of divine religions will help resolving problems of mankind it said

On May 4 2007 former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami met Pope Benedict and said the wounds between Christians and Muslims were still very deep including those caused by a controversial papal speech last September Khatami became one of the most prominent Muslim clerics to visit the Vatican since the Popes controversial Regensburg speech which angered Muslims by appearing to link Islam and violenceThe Vatican said Khatami and the Pope met for about 30 minutes and spoke through interpreters about the dialogue among cultures to overcome current tensions and promote peace In talks that a spokesman called cordial they also discussed the problems of minority Christians in Iran and the Middle East and encouraged peace efforts such as the conference on Iraqs future taking place in Sharm ElSheikh Egypt In December Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a Christmas message to the Pope saying that he hoped the Christian feast would bring peace and tranquility founded upon justice and spirituality to the international community He told the Pontiff that he hoped the new year 2008 would bring the elimination of oppression of violence and of discrimination

The Pope called for the establishment of a Palestinian state He said May the international community which reaffirms Israels just right to exist in peace assist the Palestinian people to overcome the precarious conditions in which they live and to build their future moving towards the constitution of a state that is truly their own

The Pope received the first Bethlehem Passport from Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican on December 3 2005 The citation reads

In that the bearer of this passport is a citizen of Bethlehem that they recognise this ancient city provides a light to the world and to all people who uphold the values of a just and open society that they will remain a true friend to Bethlehem through its imprisonment and that they will strive to keep the ideals of Bethlehem alive as long as the wall stands we ask you to respect the bearer of the passport and to let them pass freely

The passport is an initiative of the Open Bethlehem foundation which was founded in November 2005 with the support of Bethlehem civil institutions and world figures including former USA President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu

On June 14 2006 Pope Benedict XVI urged Israelis and Palestinians in his weekly general audience to return to negotiation after the increasingly blind titfortat violence The Vatican said in a statement that the pope felt close to the innocent victims of such violence and that the Holy Land had become hostage to those who delude themselves they can solve the ever more dramatic problems of the region by force or unilateral action The Vatican appealed to both sides to show due respect for human life especially that of unarmed civilians and children In its statement the Vatican urged the resumption with courage of the path of negotiations the only one that can lead to the just and lasting peace we all aspire to It also urged the international community to rapidly activate funds for humanitarian aid to Palestinians Later that month the Pope called for serene and peaceful coexistence in the Middle East Referring to Eastern Catholic Churches in the Holy Land the Pope said

the serious difficulties it is going through because of profound insecurity lack of work innumerable restrictions and consequent growing poverty are a cause of pain for us all I invite pastors faithful and everyone in positions of responsibility in the civil community to favour mutual respect between cultures and religions and to create as soon as possible the conditions for serene and peaceful coexistence throughout the Middle East
On July 14 2006 The Vatican condemned Israels strikes on Lebanon saying they were an attack on a sovereign nation Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano said Pope Benedict and his aides were very worried that the developments in the Middle East risked degenerating into a conflict with international repercussions In particular the Holy See deplores right now the attack on Lebanon a free and sovereign nation and assures its closeness to these people who already have suffered so much to defend their independence he told Vatican Radio

Two days later the Pope prayed that God grant the fundamental gift of harmony bringing political leaders back on the path of reason and opening new possibilities for dialogue and understanding In these days the news from the Holy Land are all cause for new grave worry in particular the widening of belligerent actions even in Lebanon and for the numerous victims among the civilian population At the origin of these merciless conflicts are unfortunately objective situations of violation of rights and of justice But neither terrorist acts nor retaliation above all when there are tragic consequences for the civilian population can be justified going down such roads  bitter experience has shown  does not bring positive results Later that month Pope Benedict stated that he did not plan to intervene diplomatically in the Middle East fighting but called on people of all religions to join Sundays worldwide day of prayers for peace I think it is best to leave that to the diplomats because we dont enter politics But we do everything for peace Our goal is simply peace and we will do everything to help attain peace Benedict told reporters as he returned from an hourlong hike in the Italian Alps The Pope has set aside Sunday as a worldwide day of prayers for peace hoping the prayers will bring a halt to the fighting Benedict invited everyone to pray especially Muslims and Jews Benedict said he had heard from Catholic communities in Lebanon and Israel especially from Lebanon who implored us as they have implored the Italian government to help We will help with our prayers and with the people we have in  in Lebanon

Pope Benedict XVI appealed on July 30 2006 for an immediate ceasefire in the Middle East hours after the deadliest attack in nearly three weeks of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah In the name of God I appeal to all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that they immediately put down their arms on all sides Immediately I appeal to governing leaders and to international institutions not to spare any effort to obtain this necessary cessation of hostilities In this moment I cannot help but think of the situation ever more grave and more tragic that the Middle East is going through hundreds of dead so many wounded a huge number of the homeless and refugees houses cities and infrastructure destroyed These facts demonstrate clearly that you cannot reestablish justice create a new order and build authentic peace when you resort to instruments of violence

With the war in Lebanon the Vaticans Middle East policies under Pope Benedict XVI came into clearer focus Pope Benedicts pleas to stop the carnage particularly after an Israeli air raid killed many civilians in Qana echoed the dramatic appeals of Pope John Paul during times of Mideast conflict In private talks Vatican officials asked that the US government use its influence with Israel to bring an immediate halt to hostilities To the Israelis the Vatican made it clear that it views its military offensive in Lebanon as a disproportionate use of force On August 7 2006 Pope Benedict XVI renewed his appeal for peace in the Middle East and said he was deeply disappointed that calls for an immediate ceasefire in Lebanon had been ignored Faced with the bitter fact that up to now the calls for an immediate ceasefire in that martyred region have been disregarded I feel impelled to renew my pressing appeal to that effect asking everyone to offer their real contribution to the construction of a just and lasting peace Pope Benedict donated two ambulances and emergency medical supplies to Caritas in Lebanon 

War is the worst solution for everyone he has said It brings nothing of good for anyone not even for the apparent victors We know this well in Europe after the two world wars What everyone needs is peace There are moral forces ready to help people understand that the only solution is that we must live together He said the Vaticans actions and his own appeals were designed to mobilize all the potential forces of peace

Pope Benedict sent a special envoy to Lebanon to lead prayers for peace The Pope has asked Roger Etchegaray a French Cardinal who was often the late Pope John Pauls special envoy to trouble spots to transmit to the suffering population  his spiritual proximity and real solidarity While the French cardinals mission is essentially religious to try to celebrate Mass on Sunday with the patriarch of Lebanons Maronite church the Vatican says he may also meet President mile Lahoud and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora Etchegaray 83yearold president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace was sent by Pope John Paul to Iraq in early 2003 to meet Saddam Hussein and try to avert war

The Pope encouraged Syria to use its influence to help resolve Middle East conflicts and counter terrorism He told Syrias ambassador that he was heartened by the diplomats assurances that Damascus is committed to counter this growing threat to peace and stability The world looks especially to countries with significant influence in the Middle East in the hopeful expectation of signs of progress toward the resolution of these longstanding conflicts the Pope said A UN General Assembly resolution in September demanded that Israel withdraw from the Golan Heights which it annexed from Syria in 1967 You have spoken of your governments concern over the annexation of the Golan Heights by Israel in 1967 Benedict said referring to a speech that was just delivered by the ambassador Makram Obeid as the envoy presented his credentials Like many impartial observers the Holy See believes that solutions are possible within the framework of international law through the implementation of the relevant United Nations resolutions the pontiff said

The Pope met Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas in April 2007 for talks that focused on the situation in the Middle East the Vatican said in a statement In particular an appreciation was expressed for the relaunch also thanks to the efforts of the international community of the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians the statement said Benedict also discussed the difficulty faced by Catholics in the Palestinian territories and the value of their contribution to that society it added

On September 12 2006 while lecturing on Faith Reason and the University at the University of Regensburg where he was formerly a professor Pope Benedict quoted the opinion of Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached In the original German Benedict XVI described this critical opinion of Manuel II as addressed with a startling brusqueness in erstaunlich schroffer uns berraschend schroffer Form 
The Pope later explained that the remark was meant to compare early Muslim teaching on religious freedom with the later teaching on jihad and was cited as part of a larger theological assertion that reason and faith go hand in hand and that the concept of a holy war is always unreasonable and against the nature of God Muslim or Christian 

The quotation from this medieval text drew criticism from a number of individual governmental representatives and Muslim religious leaders including Yusuf AlQaradawi Hamza Yusuf and Ali Bardakolu the Director of Religious Affairs of Turkey as well as the governments of Somalia and Pakistan and Indias major political parties Some critics claimed the Pope made a number of historical errors The main one being that although the Pope had said that verse 2256 stating There is no compulsion in religion was an early verse when Mohamed was powerless in Mecca this verse was one of the latest verses to be added to the Quran in Medina at a time when the Muslim state was powerful thereby taking a lot of weight out of the Popes statement Others have noted a heavy reliance on analogia entis rather than analogia fidei and to consider faith as the common ground in the approach to Islam

The Director of the Vatican press office Federico Lombardi explained the Popes statement It was certainly not the intention of the Holy Father to undertake a comprehensive study of the jihad and of Muslim ideas on the subject still less to offend the sensibilities of Muslim faithful Quite the contrary what emerges clearly from the Holy Fathers discourses is a warning addressed to Western culture to avoid the contempt for God and the cynicism that considers mockery of the sacred to be an exercise of freedom

There were public protests including violent ones in the West Bank where two churches were firebombed over his comments in various countries in the subsequent days There has been a death threat on the Pope since the lecture from a group linked to Al Qaeda 
Pope Benedict expressed his regret for any offense his words had given The Holy Father is very sorry that some passages of his speech may have sounded offensive to the sensibilities of Muslim believers said Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone in a statement According to CNN the Vatican comments fell short of a literal apology 

On September 17 2006 from the balcony at his residence at Castel Gandolfo outside Rome Pope Benedict publicly expressed that he was deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries and stressed that the words which were considered offensive were not his own but were quoted from a medieval text and that his speech was intended to act as an invitation to mutually respectful dialogue with Muslims rather than an attempt to cause offense A few days later the Pope held a meeting at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo with approximately 20 Muslim diplomats At this meeting the Pope Benedict expressed total and profound respect for all Muslims Among the ambassadors invited included Iraq Iran Turkey Morocco and many other nations and Islamic Groups

The following month Pope Benedict XVI took another step to placate anger in the Islamic world over his remarks on holy war making additions to his original text affirming that a quotation from a 14thcentury Byzantine emperor was not his personal opinionThe original said the emperors remark was made somewhat brusquely In the new version it says it was made with a brusqueness that we find unacceptable Benedict added in a footnote In the Muslim world this quotation has unfortunately been taken as an expression of my personal position thus arousing understandable indignation I hope that the reader of my text can see immediately that this sentence does not express my personal view of the Quran for which I have the respect due to the holy book of a great religion He said he cited the text as part of an examination of the relationship between faith and reason

An open letter was sent to Pope Benedict XVI by 38 Muslim authorities later extended to 100 express an acceptance for his apology over his remarks on Islam The signatories to the letter declare that they accept the Popes personal expression of sorrow and assurance that the controversial quote did not reflect his personal opinion Some of the clerics who signed the letter were Shaikh Habib Ali of the Tabah Institute in Abu Dhabi and Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad the special adviser to Jordans King Abdullah II Others who signed the letter include the grand muftis of Egypt Russia Bosnia Croatia Kosovo and Metohija Serbia Turkey Uzbekistan and Oman as well as the Iranian Shiite cleric Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Taskhiri and Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr of George Washington University Washington

Pope Benedict XVI said his forthcoming visit to Turkey in 2006 was a sign of the friendship he held for the Turkish people As you all know I am leaving for Turkey on Tuesday the Pontiff said in his weekly Angelus prayer in Rome on the preceding Sunday Starting right now I want to send a cordial greeting to the dear Turkish people rich in history and culture To these people and their representatives I express feelings of esteem and sincere friendship The Pope said he backed Turkeys bid to join the European Union Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan said after meeting the pontiff upon his arrival in Ankara for his first visit to a Muslim country The Pope told Erdoan that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires Turkeys membership in the EU

The Pope had reversed his earlier opposition to Turkeys efforts to join the EU appearing to back the overwhelmingly Muslim countrys hardfought push towards membership at the start of his visit The Pope expressed hope that Turkey would join the EU A papal spokesman later clarified the remarks saying the Pope had told the Turkish leader the Vatican did not have the power to intervene but viewed positively and encouraged the process of Turkeys entry into the EU on the basis of common values and principles Mr Erdoan said The most important message the Pope gave was toward Islam reiterating his view of Islam as peaceful and affectionate

Pope Benedict XVI visited one of Turkeys most famous mosques in what was seen as an attempt to mend relations with the Muslim community During his tour of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul accompanied by local art historian Dr Sedat Bornoval the pontiff turned towards Mecca in a gesture of Muslim prayer together with Prof Dr Mustafa arc Mufti of stanbul It marked only the second papal visit in history to a Muslim place of worship Earlier the Pope visited the nearby Hagia Sophia Museum  a site heavy with Christian and Muslim symbolism  drawing a large crowd of protesters

The Papal trip to Turkey was widely hailed as a success The aim was to mend fences there and as he was greeted on his return by Italian leader Romano Prodi the pontiff appeared to have succeeded in this Ilter Turan a professor of political science in Istanbul said Visiting the Blue Mosque and praying with the Muslims indicated that maybe he had not expressed himself carefully in his earlier conversations with students at Regensburg and certainly his gestures will go a long way to alleviate the initial scar that was left by his remarks The Pope also praised Islam as a peaceful faith and expressed support for Turkeys bid to join the EU

The prayer in Istanbuls Blue Mosque was not initially planned but it turned out to be very meaningful It was a prayer to the one Lord of heaven and earth merciful father of all mankind Addressing todays general audience this was how Benedict XVI described his silent prayer on 30 November in Istanbul The Pope thanked divine Providence for this and said May all believers identify themselves with the one God and bear witness to true brotherhood The Pontiff augured that Turkey will be a bridge of friendship and collaboration between East and West and he thanked the Turkish people for the cordiality and sympathy they showed him throughout his stay when he felt loved and understood

The Vatican considered Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogans strong victory in the 2007 general election in Turkey the best result for Europe and for the Christian churches In an interview published by Italian daily Corriere della Sera Cardinal Sergio Sebastiani also invited the European Union to resume talks with Ankara on Turkeys entry to the bloc

Francesc Palu
Francesc Palu or Francisco Palu 17231789 was a Spanish Franciscan missionary administrator and historian on the Baja California Peninsula and in Alta California Palu made significant contributions to the Alta California and Baja California mission systems Along with his mentor Junpero Serra Palu worked to build numerous missions throughout Alta and Baja California many structures of which still stand today A member of the Franciscan Order Palu became Presidente of the missions in Baja California and later of missions of Alta California Palus work in the Spanish mission system spans from his early twenties to his death at the age of 66
According to biographer Herbert E Bolton Fray Palu was a diligent student devout Christian loyal disciple tireless traveler zealous missionary firm defender of the faith resourceful pioneer successful mission builder able administrator and fair minded historian of California Palu is particularly noted for his pious biography of Serra and for his multivolume early history of the Californias

Francisco born Francesc Palu was born in Palma Majorca Spain where he joined the Franciscan Order Together with Junpero Serra he traveled to New Spain in 1740 and served as a missionary in the Sierra Gorda region of Quertaro When the Jesuits were expelled from Baja California in 1768 the Franciscans under Serra were sent to replace them Palu was assigned to the mission of San Javier The following year Serra went north to find the new mission province of Alta California and Palu succeeded him as head of the Baja California missions When the Dominicans took over the peninsular Baja California missions in 1773 Palu being Franciscan moved on to Upper California marking the geographical boundary between the two orders fields He assisted in the exploration of the site of San Francisco and administered Mission San Francisco de Ass When Serra died Palu was briefly acting head of the Baja California missions but soon returned to central Mexico

As a missionary of the Spanish colonization of the Americas Palu traveled and proselytized in the Spanish colonial empire His extensive travels left him knowledgeable of world matters and wellrespected as a scholar Coming from simple beginnings Palu was born in 1723 at Palma on the Island of Majorca and began religious work early in his life as he entered the Franciscan Order around the age of seventeen in 1739 After developing a mentorstudent relationship with Junpero Serra they both eagerly joined the Spanish mission system in Alta California They along with several other missionaries reached Veracruz New Spain in 1749 Palu worked in New Spain for many in missions such as Sierra Gorda He was later recalled along with Serra to work in the San Saba region of Texas However the biggest part of Palus journey would not begin until 1767 when he and fourteen other Franciscan friars were sent north to extend their efforts and replace many of the Jesuit missionaries who had been previously expelled from Spain Much of Palus life would be spent in Alta California and many of his notable endeavors occurred there as well

Palu and the other friars reached Loreto in Lower California in the spring of 1768 Palou was given control of Mission San Francisco Javier The following year Junipero Serra left for Alta California to proceed with the further establishment of missions in that region This left the office of president or superior of all missions in Lower California for Palu to control until 1773 When the Lower Californian missions were turned over to the Dominican missionaries Palu was able to rejoin his brethren and mentor in Upper California He first went to San Diego then continued onwards to Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo in presentday Carmel which Serra had been using as his headquarters Palu greatly assisted in the placement of friars and recorded historical data the only surviving account of some aspects of the early California missions

In 1774 Palu accompanied Captain Riveras expedition to the Bay of San Francisco and on December 4 planted the cross on a hill he named Lobos wolves which sits in clear view of the Golden Gate and Pacific Ocean The name lives on as Lobos Creek within the Presidio of San Francisco

The Rivera expedition returned to the Presidio of Monterey via the coastal route first explored by the Portol expedition of 1769 At the north end of Monterey Bay Rivera and Palu inspected the area around todays Santa Cruz described by friar Juan Cresp who accompanied Portol and recommended by Cresp as a future mission site Palu agreed and on December 9 selected a location where Mission Santa Cruz was later founded by Fermn Lasun in 1791

Palu returned to Lobos in 1776 with the De Anza expedition and on June 28 offered up the first mass at the future site of Mission Dolores which Palu founded but a few weeks later Palu remained at the new mission until he was called to give his mentor and close friend Junpero Serra his last rites in 1784 at Mission San Carlos

With Serras death Palu became the acting presidente of the Upper California missions until the formal appointment of Lasun as successor to Serra Palu remained at Mission San Carlos until failing health and old age led him to retire in 1785 to the missionary College of San Fernando de Mexico He was elected guardian of the college and held this office until his death in Mexico where he had completed his biography of Serra most of which he had written while still in California

Francisco Palu played many key roles and offices vital to the establishment of several of the missions in California and many of those in Mexico He compiled a standard history of the California missions from 1767 to 1784 in his noticias as a fourvolume set He also wrote of his teacher Junpero Serra Both works provide key information about early California and the missionary system established there

Asma bint Shihab
Asma Bint Shihab alSulayhiyya died 1087 was the queen and coruler of Yemen in coregency with her cousin and spouse Ali alSulayhi and later her son Ahmad alMukkaram and daughterinlaw Arwa alSulayhi from 1047 until 1087 Her full title as sovereign alSayyida alHurratul translates to The noble lady who is free and independent the woman sovereign who bows to no superior authority As female sovereign Asma bint Shihab has an almost unique position in history though there were more female monarchs in the international Muslim world Asma bint Shihab and Arwa alSulayhi were the only female monarchs in the Muslim Arab world to have had the khutba proclaimed in their name in the mosques as sovereigns 

Asma bint Shihab married her cousin Ali alSulayhi sultan and founder of the Sulayhid dynasty The marriage between Ali and Asma was reportedly a happy one and Ali relied on her support on his way to power and participated in the sacrifices his religious faith placed upon him 

When Ali became king in 1047 he named her queen malika but not merely his consort but his formally acknowledged coruler and political partner who governed the realm of Yemen by his side In recognition of this her name was proclaimed alongside that of her spouse in the Khutba the traditional privilege of a sovereign in a Muslim state the khutba was proclaimed from the pulpits of the mosques of Yemen in her husbands name and in her name after the Fatimid sovereign and her husband May Allah prolong the days of alHurra the perfect who manages the affairs of the faithful with care This was the first time ever in history when the name of a woman had been proclaimed in the khutba Another almost unique occurrence was that queen Asma bint Shihab attended councils with her face uncovered that is to say unveiled

Muhammad alThawr described her She was one of the most famous women of her time and one of the most powerful She was munificent She was a poetess who composed verses Among the praises given her husband alSulayhi by the poets was the fact that he had her for a wife   When he ascertained the perfection of her character her husband entrusted the management of state business to her He rarely made decisions that went against her advice and  regarded her with very great respect and never gave any other opinion precedence over hers

In 1067 during the pilgrimage to Mecca the Banu Najah clan under Said Ibn Najah the prince of Zabid attacked the travel party of Ali and Asma killed Ali and took Asma prisoner She was sequestered in a secret prison in Zabid and reportedly the severed head of her spouse was planted on a pole visible from her cell After a years imprisonment she managed to get a message through to her son and daughterinlaw in Sana and her son stormed Zabid and freed her

Asma returned to her realm and assisted her son Ahmad alMukkaram and daughterinlaw Arwa alSulayhi with the management of the realm until she died When she met her son alMukarram she confirmed him as his fathers successor but when he was paralyzed shortly afterward she retook control as the coregent of the realm together with her daughterinlaw Arwa who was to be her coruler in accordance with the will of her son as he was himself unable to rule because of his condition 

Queen Asma was sometime affectionally referred to as the Little Queen of Sheba according to Muhammad alThawr Some poets carried away by their admiration of Asma went so far as to declaim that if the throne of the queen of Sheba had been magnificent that of Asma was still more so This is somewhat remarkable as the queen of Sheba belonged to the jahiliyya the time before Islam which was traditionally viewed as a negative one Another name used both for her and her daughterinlaw and coregent was malika hazima malika means queen and hazim was an epithet awarded people regarded to have shown the utmost wisdom and judgement in political affairs

Leon Gilbert
Leon Aaron Gilbert Jr November 9 1920 March 28 1999 of York Pennsylvania was a decorated World War II combat veteran and a lieutenant in the allblack 24th U S Infantry Regiment that fought in the Korean War His courtmartial for refusing to obey an order from the regiments white commanding officer led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the US military

By the early 1950s various Executive Orders had been issued attempting to end segregation in the US armed forces They had been largely ineffectual The 24th Infantry Regiment which consisted entirely of black soldiers was thrown into the forefront of the Korean fighting at the outset

Casualties in the 24th were extremely heavy and replacements and supplies including shoes were slow in coming Stories began to filter out through various black news sources of atrocities committed by white American officers against the black troops they were leading At one point the US Air Force bombed the 24th by mistake resulting in serious casualties

On August 6 1951 Colonel Arthur S Champeny a white man was appointed the 24ths commanding officer and informed them he was going to change their reputation from the frightened 24th to the fighting 24th

Leon Aaron Gilbert Jr was born in York Pennsylvania on November 9 1920 the eldest of two sons of a blacksmith who had also served in World War I He was educated in local schools and enlisted in the U S Army at Harrisburg Pennsylvania on August 16 1940 He served with the 92d Division in Italy and was honorably discharged in 1946 then called up again as a reservist in 1947 He was thus a decorated veteran with a record of ten years service in the Army He and his wife Kay had two children with a third on the way

In the fall of 1950 Gilbert was in command of Company A of the 24th having taken over when his commanding officer was wounded He received an order to return with twelve of his men to a forward position Gilberts company had been forced to withdraw from that position after coming under heavy machine gun fire at close to point blank range so to return to that position would have been tantamount to suicide When Gilbert refused the order to return he was arrested and tried on the spot Despite Gilberts suffering from shock and fatigue due to prolonged heavy fighting according to a letter to his wife they had gone thirteen days without food or water he was accused of insubordination and cowardice and a court martial sentenced him to death In an interview with the New York Times Gilbert gave his version of the incident

I did not refuse to obey the order I was trying to explain why it couldnt be carried out There were twelve men in my command Then I considered it my duty as an officer to show why the order meant certain death

A storm of public protest erupted around the world in reaction to the sentencing in the US labor leaders church leaders and the American Legion became involved and the National Negro Council collected 600000 signatures on a petition for his pardon President Harry S Truman commuted the sentence to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of all pay and pension allowances

In September 1952 the sentence was reduced to seventeen years for battle misconduct Gilbert served five years the maximum penalty for disobedience under peacetime conditions war was never officially declared in Korea before he was released

Following the courtmartialing of Lieutenant Gilbert mass courtmartialing of whole units of the 24th Regiment ensued with no comparable action being taken against white units

Thurgood Marshall general counsel of the NAACP wrote The letters we have received from convicted soldiers and the talks we have had with war correspondents strongly indicate that many of these men have been victimized by racial discrimination It seems apparent that some of them are being made scapegoats for the failures of higher personnel

In 1996 an official Army report noted that Gilberts regiment performed poorly in the early years of the Korean War as did many white units but went on to say There was no single reason for what happened to the 24thAn aggressive enemy old and worn equipment inexperience at all levels leadership failures high and low casualties among key personnel and a lack of bonding and cohesion in some units all played their part There was no lack of courage among the officers and men

The incident scarred Gilbert for life His father had died while he was in custody and five years after he was released on parole his wife divorced him Gilbert returned to his hometown of York Pennsylvania remarried and lived quietly until his death Although he never stopped trying to clear his name to little avail his last years were cheered somewhat by the fact that his surviving comradesinarms had never forgotten him and after they had located him welcomed him back into their ranks As one of them reported He didnt know if we would accept him We welcomed him with open arms No matter what was written no matter what was said we know the facts We were there

Renix
Renix Renix Electronique was a joint venture by Renault and Bendix that designed and manufactured automobile electronic ignitions fuel injection systems electronic automatic transmission controls and various engine sensors Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles The name became synonymous in the US with the computer and fuel injection system used on the AMCJeep 25L I4 and 40L I6 engines

The term Renix also has a number of applications In certain carburetor equipped Renault and Volvo models it provides an electronic ignition system consisting of an engine control unit ECU to replace the job of contact breaker points in the distributor The system uses an angle sensor and a number of fuel sensors to provide a maintenancefree ignition system The ECU is sealed and cannot be serviced and the EPROM cannot be reprogrammed

Later the name was synonymous with a form of fuel injection In such an application it consisted of an ECU and a number of sensors It was first seen in engines produced by Renault Renault 21 25 and Espace in and capacities It is better known in America for its application in the AMC 40L displacing straight6 engines Production began by American Motors AMC with the 1987 Jeep Cherokee XJ models It was preceded by the AMC Computerized Engine Control and followed by Chryslers Mopar MPI system

Renix Electronique SA was established in 1981 as a joint venture by Renault with 51 interest and Bendix with 49 that was headquartered in Toulouse Renix Corporation of America was the North American subsidiary of Renix Electronique to provide sales logistics engineering and quality support to American Motors

When Renault encountered financial troubles in 1985 it sold its interest in Renix to AlliedSignal a major auto industry supplier and the new owner of Bendix Renix Corporation of America was also absorbed by AlliedSignal Corporation when it purchased Renix Electronique from Renault The US200 million Allied buyout of Renaults 51 of Renix made it part of Bendix Electronics and Engine Controls Renix products will be produced in France and marketed worldwide under the Bendix brand name In 1988 the French Bendix site is sold to Siemens VDO In 2008 Siemens AG sells its VDO branch to Continental automotive group

The Renix system was used in the J series engines as fitted to the Renault 19 16V Renault 21 and SavannaNevada the Renault 25 and the Renault Espace It was a multipoint fuel injection system as opposed to a singlepoint system with a number of air throttle and pinking sensors and an advanced computer Application of the system could first be seen in 1984 three years before its American debut The Renix system pushed the power of the carburetorfed engine from  It could also be found in 22L engines fitted to R21 25 and Espace models

The Renix fuel injection and a Garrett turbocharger was used in the midmounted V6 powering the Renault Alpine GTAA610 sports car

AMCRenault uses a fully integrated electronic engine control system made by Renix
The Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solidstate Ignition Control Module ICM a distributor a crankshaft position sensor and an Electronic Control Unit ECU The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time It also incorporates an engine knocking sensor that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head Good signal to noise ratio is obtained primarily through angular discrimination

The Renix system has more inputs than the later Mopar system and in some ways is more complex Its knock sensor automatically tunes the spark advance curve to an optimum mix for each cylinder Some Renix controlled engines will actually get better fuel economy using higher octane fuel The system on the AMC 40L is flexible allowing the use of a larger camshaft and modifications to the cylinder heads without significant changes to the base computer

The Renix computer was first used on 1986 AMC 25 L fourcylinder enginess The system improved the drivability of the Jeep Cherokee and Comanche over carbureted models The power increase was also noticeable The Renix system was used through the 1990 model year Unfortunately it is handicapped because few scan tools can be plugged in to this onboard diagnostics computer The Renix control system prior to 1991 can be tested only with Chryslers DRB tester and the diagnostic test modes for 1989 and later engines with SBEC controllers differ from those provided for 1988 and earlier models

The Renix control system was only found on the 19871990 Jeep Cherokee and Comanche with AMCdesigned engines the control setup used with the V6 was OBDI General Motors and the early Diesel was a Renault turbodiesel I4 that used its own specific control setup

The Jeep Wrangler YJ did not get the AMC 40 engine until 1991 when it was accompanied by Chryslerdesigned electronics as well Until then it retained the AMC engine with a carburetor No other Jeep vehicle was equipped with Renix electronic controls

In a typical Jeep application the ignition control module ICM is located in engine compartment It consists of a solidstate ignition circuit as well as an integrated ignition coil that can be removed and serviced separately Electronic signals from the ECU to the ICM determine the amount of ignition timing or retard needed to meet engine power requirements The ECU provides an input signal to the ICM The ICM has outputs for a tach signal to the tachometer and a high voltage signal from the coil to the distributor The crankshaft position sensor senses TDC Top Dead Center and BDC crankshaft positions as well as engine rpm This sensor is secured by special shouldered bolts to flywheeldrive plate housing and is not adjustable

The Renix control system is preOBD and therefore does not have a Check Engine Lamp It also does not store or throw Diagnostic Trouble Codes DTCs or Parameter IDs PIDs This is a common problem at vehicle inspection particularly in California and other jurisdictions with emission standards Most inspection stations are not aware and will try to explain the CELMIL doesnt work

In the 1980s Skoda manufactured a small number of rearengined cars with Renix fuel injection These were originally destined for Canada but ended up in Europe These are usually known as 135 GLi or 135 RiC Fuel system parts may be available from ChryslerJeep dealers

The Volvo 700 Series and some of the Volvo 300 Series used a B200K 20L inline4 naturally aspirated engine with Renix ignition and some 300 series Volvos with Renault powerplants The 300 Volvo series is not known US It was manufactured in the Netherlands with a limited production of cars in Malaysia through CKD process

All 300 series Volvo cars with gasoline engines came with RenixBendix ignition 1983 onwards until 1991 when production of the 300 series stopped
Volvo Redblock engines equipped with Renix ignition 

Renault derived units with Renix ignition 

B172K and B18 were based on the Renault FnN n being 1 2 or 3 engines from Renault B14x based on Renault C1J both types were modified for Volvo to varying extent

Percival Vega Gull
The Percival Vega Gull was a 1930s British fourseater touring aircraft built by Percival Aircraft Limited It was a singleengine lowwing Folding woodandfabric monoplane with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage

Built by Percival Aircraft of Gravesend and Luton after 1936 when Percival Aircraft became a Limited Company the KSeries Vega Gull was a development of their earlier DSeries Gull The main changes from the earlier design were the provision of an additional fourth seat dual controls and flaps The fuselage was widened and the wingspan increased Increases in drag were compensated for by reducing parasitic drag from exterior fittings such as hinges and actuation horns This work was largely attributable to the arrival at Percivals of the talented aircraft designer Arthur Bage Thus the Vega Gull was very nearly as fast as the more svelte Gull Six Payload range and utility were all much improved The prototype GAEAB first flew from Gravesend in November 1935

The Vega Gull retained the de Havilland Gipsy Six aircooled inline engine introduced in the D3 Gull Six of 1934 Most examples were fitted with the optional DH Gipsy Six Series II engine in conjunction with the DHPD30 VP airscrew The final Mk II examples were fitted with a curved windscreen the earlier examples had a multifaceted windscreen of flat panels similar in appearance to the early marks of the Proctor

A Vega Gull named Messenger was used by Beryl Markham on her transatlantic flight 45 September 1936 the first solo easttowest crossing by a woman

Two early production Vega Gulls were entered into the Schlesinger Race from England to Johannesburg South Africa CWA Scott and Giles Guthrie flying Vega Gull GAEKE was the only finisher landing at Rand Airport on 1 October 1936 The aircraft had left Portsmouth 52 hours 56 minutes 48 seconds earlier With the publicity of the win Percival set up a production line at larger premises at Luton The new type was an immediate success with production running to 90 the last production aircraft having its maiden flight on 27 July 1939

The Vega Gull was widely used by British and Commonwealth aviators during the later years of the Golden Age of recordsetting aviation during the 1930s Alex Henshaw Jim Mollison Amy Johnson Beryl Markham CWA Scott and others won races and broke records to South Africa South America Australia and New Zealand to name but a few

In addition to civil orders 15 were ordered by the Air Ministry Of these 11 served with 24 Squadron Royal Air Force on communications duties and two were issued to the Fleet Air Arm which was yet to come under Admiralty control The remaining two were used by the British air attachs in Buenos Aires and Lisbon A third aircraft for use by the British air attach in Berlin was seized by the Germans at the outbreak of the Second World War It remains unclear whether the Luftwaffe subsequently used this machine

After the outbreak of war Vega Gulls were requisitioned for military use In the UK 21 were impressed in 193940 14 for the RAF and seven for the FAA Two aircraft were impressed in each of Australia and India while one other was called to the colours in New Zealand

By the end of the war the Vega Gull had been largely supplanted by its younger sibling the Proctor of which more than 1100 were manufactured Most Proctors especially the later examples were slower and more cumbersome than the original Vega Despite the obvious drawbacks of its wooden airframe in terms of durability the Vega Gull compares favourably with more modern designs To save hangar space the wings could be folded to reduce the space needed for storage


Civil Vega Gulls have been registered in the following countries Argentina Australia Belgium Canada France Germany India Iraq Japan Kenya Netherlands New Zealand Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom and United States

Herman H Pevler
Herman H Pevler 20 April 1903  29 August 1978 was the 10th president of the Roanoke VA based Norfolk and Western Railway NW He had previously served as president of the Wabash Railroad and served as president of the NW from October 1 1963 until his retirement in April 1970

Commonwealth Magazine once described Pevler as a driver who operated with doors open and coats off citing the sheer force of his personality and vigor in his activities He was an alumnus of Purdue University He was buried in Evergreen Burial Park Roanoke Virginia

In 1927 Herman Pevler commenced work with the Pennsylvania Railroad and he was elected Vice President of that railway in 1948

In 1959 he was elected a director of the First National Bank at St Louis

Herman Pevler was the president of Wabash Railroad before he succeeded Stuart T Saunders as President of NW Saunders left to head the Pennsylvania Railroad a major NW stockholder at that time Pevler oversaw consummation of a complex group of mergers begun under Saunders which brought into the NW fold the Nickel Plate Road the Wabash Railroad and portions of the Pennsylvania Railroad The mergers were completed in 1964 and widely expanded the company reaching such major points as Detroit Chicago and St Louis The latter two were major gateways and interchange points with western railroads

Following the expansion NW revenues quadrupled during Pevlers administration Coming from the Wabash he was the first NW president in the 20th century to have not come up through the lower ranks of the NW and his leadership was met with some resistance by some NW staff Among his legacies was a change in NW livery on locomotives to a blue very similar to that employed by the Wabash which became known within the company as Pevler blue As his mandatory retirement age approached it became known that Pevler intended to recommend to the Board of Directors a top official of another railroad as his replacement However quick maneuvering by NW insiders and lobbying of key directors resulted in the selection of John P Fishwick a longtime NW staff attorney who Pevler had assigned to Cleveland to oversee a subsidiary operation

In 1959 Pevler wrote a 12page pamphlet on Featherbedding titled The Changing Railroad Picture

Pevler supported the Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966

In 1967 Pevler was named Roanokes Outstanding Citizen

YaleChina Association
The YaleChina Association  formerly YaleinChina is an independent nonprofit organization which seeks to develop educational programs in and about China and further understanding between Chinese and American people Founded in 1901 and originally a Protestant missionary society YaleChinas work is characterized by longterm relationships to build Chinese institutional capacity Current programs include the fields of public health and nursing legal education English language instruction American Studies and cultural exchange for Chinese and American students Publications include a regular newsletter biennial report and the annual YaleChina Health Journal

The YaleChina Association was first incorporated as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society and was known informally as YaleinChina as early as 1913 It was nondenominational from its beginnings and by the 1920s had ceased to be an overtly missionary enterprise It was reincorporated in 1934 as a secular organization the YaleinChina Association and in 1975 as the YaleChina Association

A reflection of the religious fervor sweeping American college campuses at the end of the 19th century which took form in the Student Volunteer Movement YaleChina was founded in 1901 as the Yale Foreign Missionary Society by a group of Yale graduates and faculty members committed to establishing a Christian missionary presence overseas The founders chose China as the focus of their work in part to honor the memory of a Yale graduate from the class of 1892 Horace Tracy Pitkin who had worked in China as a missionary and was killed in 1900 during the Boxer Uprising The city of Changsha in Hunan Province was chosen as the base of operations in China after consultation with other foreign missionaries

At the urging of the home office in New Haven as well as other missionaries in China the Yale Mission early on assumed more of an educational than evangelical function With the arrival of Dr Edward H Hume in 1905 medical education and care became a major focus of the endeavor The educational compound that began with Dr Humes medical clinic eventually grew to comprise a preparatory school the Yali School the College of YaleinChina later moved to Wuhan where it joined two other missionary colleges to form Huachung University and the HsiangYa Medical College Nursing School and Hospital Over the years HsiangYa a compound of hsiang denoting Hunan and ya denoting YaleChina transliterated today as Xiangya developed a reputation for providing the most advanced training in Western medicine in all of central and southern China More than at other foreignaffiliated institutions an effort was made early on to bring as many Chinese faculty and administrators on board as possible By the late 1920s all major leadership positions were held by Chinese and YaleinChina was very much a joint SinoAmerican enterprise

Between 1919 and 1920 future Chairman Mao Zedong had several encounters with the school he edited its student magazine refocusing it on thought reorientation and operated a bookshop out of its medical college

The war years 193745 placed enormous strains on the YaleinChina institutions especially the HsiangYa Hospital which cared for war casualties and refugees For example the life of paralyzed Frank Wattendorf was spared at the hospital before he was evacuated

Many of the Changsha facilities were damaged by invading Japanese troops Nevertheless these challenges served to inspire renewed commitment on the part of both American and Chinese faculty and administrators The YaleinChina staff who returned to Changsha in September 1945 were determined to rebuild the campus and resume their prewar operations Within four years however a Communist insurgency toppled the Nationalist government and YaleinChinas future seemed uncertain in the face of growing hostility between the United States and China

By 1951 the new Communist government had taken possession of YaleinChinas Changsha properties and renamed the Yali School as Liberation Middle School Dr Dwight Rugh YaleinChinas last representative in Changsha spent most of 1950 under house arrest as the only American on campus and was eventually expelled from China in May 1951 With his departure the ties between YaleinChina in New Haven and the institutions in Changsha and Wuhan were broken for nearly 30 years

Between 1951 and 1954 hostility against the United States on the mainland and turmoil on Nationalistheld Taiwan led to a suspension of YaleinChinas work within China Preston Schoyer who had been a Bachelor in Changsha before the war worked both formally and informally to develop new programs and maintain ties with old friends During those years YaleinChina devoted its resources to financing the education of Chinese students in the US while looking in Asia for new projects to support Attention soon focused on a refugee college in the British colony of Hong Kong which had been founded by Chien Mu 18951990 and other Chinese intellectuals determined to preserve traditional Chinese learning and values in the face of the Communist victory on the mainland In early 1954 after a visit to the colony and months of negotiations YaleinChinas trustees formally affiliated the organization with New Asia College

Unlike in Changsha YaleinChinas relationship with New Asia College was by intention one of support and assistance rather than direct administration YaleinChina secured funding from the Ford Foundation and other US foundations to support the development of the college and also provided fellowships for New Asia faculty to pursue further study in the United States In 1956 YaleinChina resumed the practice of sending Bachelors two recent Yale graduates to teach English though now to New Asia College instead of the Yali School

In the late 1950s the possibility of founding a university in Hong Kong that would use Chinese as the language of instruction was explored In 1959 the Council of British Universities selected New Asia United and Chung Chi colleges to federate and form the new Chinese University of Hong Kong which was formally inaugurated in 1963 on its Shatin campus Preston Schoyer played a key role in negotiating New Asias entrance YaleinChina contributed to the new campus by securing funds to construct buildings including the university health clinic the Yali Guest House Friendship Lodge and a student dormitory at New Asia College YaleinChina also contributed to the early internationalization of the campus by helping to establish the New Asia  YaleinChina Chinese Language Centre and the International Asian Studies Programme which now enroll hundreds of international students every year Meanwhile the relationship with New Asia College where the YaleChina Association as the organization was renamed in 1975 has maintained a representative office for fifty years remains a strong one

By the 1970s both New Asia College and the Chinese University of Hong Kong had achieved a level of institutional maturity and financial stability that decreased the need for YaleChinas contributions At the same time the normalization of diplomatic relations between the US and China presented the possibility of resumed activity on the mainland In the fall of 1979 YaleChina staff traveled to Changsha to explore opportunities for academic exchange with administrators and faculty at Hunan Medical College the successor to HsiangYa and several exchange agreements were concluded that led to the arrival of YaleChina English teachers in September 1980 and exchanges of medical personnel between Yale University and Hunan Medical College Two English instructors were also sent to Wuhan University the same year and later to Huazhong Normal University

Despite the geographical continuities however the intervening years had brought substantial changes to Chinese higher education and within YaleChina itself Political sensitivities in China and YaleChinas own evolution determined that any new activity in China would be of a nature substantially different from that of the pre1949 years Rather than seeking to resume the joint administration of the former YaleinChina institutions the emphasis was placed on shorterterm academic exchanges in the fields of medicine and American Studies and a resumption of the English language instruction program Throughout the 1980s YaleChinas medical program brought almost 50 Chinese medical personnel to the US and sent over 40 Americans to China for exchanges of medical knowledge During the same years nearly 100 Yale graduates participated in YaleChinas English teaching program in China YaleChina also continued to send English teachers to the Chinese University of Hong Kong and maintained its involvement with the universitys International Asian Studies Program

The decade of the 1990s brought an expansion of YaleChinas activities into new program areas and affiliations with institutions outside of YaleChinas historical bases in Hong Kong Changsha and Wuhan While maintaining its English teaching program YaleChina initiated projects in environmental protection and pediatric cardiology and facilitated a drama collaboration between New Havens Long Wharf Theater and the Shanghai Peoples Art Theater which resulted in a Chineselanguage stage production of Amy Tans Joy Luck Club in 1994 Other areas of expansion have included the fields of American Studies legal education public health nursing and service in the nonprofit sector for China and American students

Folsom Library
The Richard G Folsom Library Folsom Library is a research library in the Rensselaer Research Libraries system constructed in the Brutalist style located on the campus of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY It is named after Richard Gilman Folsom the President of the Institute from 19581971 The Folsom Library offers a variety of services to students and patrons of the library In addition to loans these services include class reserves general writing and presentation assistance through the Center for Communication Practices cultural and educational events interlibrary loans through ConnectNY individual and group room reservations computer labs and wireless internet

The library has integrated many electronic resources into its offering such as research databases and digital music libraries The library is also one of 1250 federal depository libraries in the United States and maintains an uptodate archive of thousands of federal documents open to the public Over 458260999 resources are available online or in the Folsom Library to faculty staff and researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute including over seven million books and eight million trade publications

The origins of the modern Folsom Library can be traced to the founding of the school in 1824 It was created in line with the Constitution and Laws of Rensselaer which stated that the school would have a very ample scientific library to which members of the institution will have free access At that time the Rensselaer School occupied The Old Bank Place in Troy and it is likely that the original library was only a single room or small part of a room The earliest librarian was a student named Albert Danker from the first graduating class and the collection consisted of a sparse number of scientific works

For a short period of time the library belonged to Amos Eaton a local scientist and educator He obtained rights to the Old Bank Place after the Rensselaer School changed its name to the Rensselaer Institute and moved to the nearby Van Der Heyden Mansion The school moved back to the Old Bank Place in the same year and upon Eatons death in 1842 regained ownership of the collection The library stayed under the ownership of Rensselaer when the institute was forced to move due to estate ownership complications to the Infant School a small brick building in downtown Troy

In 1862 sparks from a passing locomotive on the Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad bridge caused a massive fire that wiped out a large portion of Troy and the majority of Rensselaers property Relocation and reconstruction began on 8th Street in Troy and in 1864 the library of 396 volumes moved into the Main Building where it would stay for another 30 years During that time an 80page catalog of the librarys collection entitled Catalogue of the Library of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy NY was published and it listed over 1000 titles spanning various technical areas From 1893 to 1927 the library moved several times finding home in the Alumni House on 2nd Street and later moving to the Pittsburgh Building and Amos Eaton Hall

Despite its growing collection in its early years the library was rarely used by students During the years of 1912 and 1913 when the library was located in the Pittsburgh Building there was considerably low utilization of the collection with many students only visiting the building in their Senior year to prepare for their graduation theses This was also partly due to the limited scope of the collection which by Rensselaers technical nature consisted primarily of technical journals and other periodicals

Student use increased during the period of 1912 to 1927 as the curriculum of the institute expanded and more volumes were added to the collection to supplement professors instruction It was also during this period of time that the library moved from the Pittsburgh Building to the more spacious Amos Eaton building The Amos Eaton building offered sufficient space for a little over 30 years until a growing number of publications written after World War II forced the collection to move again to the recently purchased St Joseph Convent chapel

The librarys continued growth forced the institute to take into consideration creating a dedicated building for holding its collection Up until 1950 the collection had been largely technical but expansion of the Humanities and Social Sciences as well as increased research created an intense demand on the library The library had constantly been moved from building to building up until this point never having had an actual home dedicated strictly for library usage To evaluate the possibility of a new location a Library Advisory Committee was formed The committee first published their discovery of numerous deficiencies in the current library in June 1962 in a report called Future of the RPI Library Collection The New York State Education Department also noted deficiencies of the library during their evaluation of the graduate program

On June 20 1967 the Library Advisory Committee published a report known as the Greene Report which detailed the purpose and requirements of a new library for the institute as well as previous research done about the librarys efficacy The report stated that The Library is the information center of the university providing resources to the scholars who are making doing and thinking things It went on to detail the primary functions of the library to be education and research and emphasized that the library must contain a strong collection in periodical literature go beyond books towards audio visual collections strengthen peripheral material availability and centralize all of the institutess collections The report also listed a number of other improvements including


At the time it was also clear that Rensselaer was lacking in its collection when compared to its peers In 1967 James E Skipper a researcher for the Association of Research Libraries compiled a table illustrating the collections of various universities in New York

The Greene Report made it clear that there was a need for a new library on campus and the next phase of the process began where the location of the library would be decided The institute hired Quinlivan Pierik  Krause an architecture firm centered in Syracuse to evaluate the campus and determine a possible location for the new library The firm recommended a location on the west side of campus adjacent to the librarys current location in the St Joseph Convent chapel

On October 23 1970 the firm requested a meeting with the president at the time Richard Folsom to discuss the possibility of a staged construction procedure where the facility would be built in iterations Each iteration would have an increasing amount of space The initial iteration with the existing chapel space would offer a total collection storage space of  Projections by the architect indicated that a total of would be available in 1985 followed by in 2010 The firm believed that this method of construction would allow expansion at a rate that the institute budget could accommodate

President Folsom presented the idea of a phased construction to the Library Advisory Committee who supported the idea but criticized it for its continued use of the chapel as well as placing the campus in a constant state of construction The committee also suggested considering one of the earlier potential locations close to the bleachers located on the 86 Field an athletic field at the center of the campus Professor Howard Litman the chairman of the committee at the time issued the statement In summary the most recent proposal for providing new facilities for the Rensselaer library is a workable but undesirable plan of development It will for the short term provide desperately needed space but in the long run yield an unexpectedly costly facility in the wrong place 

Beyond the concerns over how the library would be constructed questions still remained over where it would be built Dissent existed among the library committee over the location with those opposed to the western development arguing that a central location would be more convenient for students The architecture firm which had supported the western location for development issued a report emphasizing the benefits of building next to the chapel In the report listed several factors that made the site an optimal choice including the fact that distant observability of a building on this site is excellent

The report convinced 10 out of the 12 members of the Library Advisory Committee to support the site recommendation In 1971 the final decision was made to create a facility on the west side of campus The new library would have an underground annex and a pedestrian plaza that would connect it to St Josephs Chapel now the Voorhees Computing Center and would cost approximately 69 million

With the constant delay in construction many students had adopted an attitude of disdain towards the library As one student quoted in a report on the library There existed an attitude of the Library being a very second class function on campus expected to make do with inadequate housing and financial support and generally held in low self esteem 

Unfortunately there existed an additional delay one year after the decision was made on the location and size of the building In 1972 James C Andrews the Director of Libraries at the Institute at the time issued a report pointing out weaknesses in the recently reaffirmed proposal for construction In the report Andrews pointed out that the current location was far from the center of the campus and student dorms was closed in on three sides by existing buildings and that the size was not sufficient for the requirement decided by student and faculty surveying Knowing that there wasnt much that could be changed about the location at this point in the development process Andrews suggested several other improvements The Library Journal a magazine which discussed various designs for libraries around the country contained an article by Andrews in which he suggested the following changes


These improvements were taken into consideration in the ultimate design of the library and construction began 
The building had its dedication ceremony on May 15 1976 J Erik Jonsson an alumnus and trustee who had donated 2 million to get construction of the library started decided to name the library after the president of the institute who had initiated construction  Richard Folsom

In its discussion of the Folsom Library The Library Journal also includes data on the Folsom Library

After the initial pouring of concrete for Folsom Librarys floors it was noticed that the concrete contracted significantlyto the point that more concrete had to be poured in order to make the floors level and be able to properly install book stacks As a result the floors are slightly bowed According to college legend the contractor designed the foundation without knowing that it was to be a library A myth spread that persists to this day that Folsom Library is slowly sinking or slipping down the hill RPI students refer to this phenomenon which also applies to a few other buildings on campus as sliding down the hill into Troy However the notion of libraries sinking into the ground is not confined to the RPI campus other communities and colleges also report the same issues even though it was debunked by snopescom

 the Rensselaer Research Libraries contained 458260999 resources available online or in the library that include

The design of the Folsom Library has remained fairly static since its initial conception in June 1972 The concrete exterior that is in place is designed to complement the light gray brick of the nearby St Josephs Chapel

In 2005 the Folsom Library Renewal project was started The redesign a product of cooperation between an alumnus and Rensselaers Design and Construction group focused on creating a more welcoming space and improving the overall image of the building

Fire in the Hole Silver Dollar City
Fire in the Hole is a threestory steel enclosed roller coaster at Silver Dollar City in Branson Missouri The ride was built inhouse by Silver Dollar City in 1972 The ride is often referred to as a cross between dark ride and roller coaster A similar ride Blazing Fury was built at Herschend Family Entertainments other theme park Silver Dollar City Tennessee in 1978 now known as Dollywood

Fire in the Hole is themed around the story of Marmaros an Ozarks hill town Marmaros was built near Marvel Cave and is the present day site of the theme park Silver Dollar City Marmaros grew out of necessity The miners attracted to the mining of guano from the cave along with their families began to grow in number The investors designed a town with the intentions of becoming a resort village such as Eureka Springs Arkansas or Monte Ne Arkansas Investments became substantial and the towns population grew rapidly

Marmaros existence relied heavily upon the mining operation of Marvel Cave The town failed to attract tourists and began to slowly die out after mining ceased Much of the town was later destroyed by fire and what was left moved to a location south of the cave and is now submerged below Table Rock Lake

The town was rumored to be burnt to the ground by a group of vigilantes known as the Baldknobbers Obscure facts have turned into legend which makes deciphering the story virtually impossible Some believe the burning of the village started out as a drunken fight in a local tavern Others blame xenophobic outrage over William H Lynch a Canadian businessman who purchased Marvel Cave Lynch would later open the cave as a tourist attraction Evidence proves that the town did in fact burn however the true story may never be established

The original concept of the ride relied heavily upon Marvel Cave itself During the planning phases of Fire in the Hole the ride was referred to as The Devils Den This was a name given to the cave centuries before mining operation had started The ride was to include volcanoes and exploding geysers However modifications were eventually made and the ride took on its current form

Fire in the Holes dated production values and odd subject matter have made the ride a cult favorite with some people even developing callback lines to shout at various points during the ride Riders pass scenes of the towns residents trying to extinguish the flames before crossing a collapsing bridge nearly getting runover by a steam train and crashing into a dynamite storage shack In the rides finale the coaster trains are sent hurtling over a drop into a pool of water with a splash down finish The splash has been part of the ride since its conception Water cannons within the splash down lake can be enhanced during the summer months to drench riders and turned off during the cooler seasons to only mist riders

Throughout the ride there are many scenes of Marmaros engulfed in flames The scenes include a burning hotel camp of Baldknobbers blazing cabin collapsing bridge and a Main Street which includes a saloon undertaker and blacksmith shop A shootout takes place on Main Street between three Baldknobbers and the town sheriff This results in the undertakers windows being shot out and bullet holes in the water tower spraying riders

To increase rider capacity a large section of track was removed in 1982 After the first dip Collapsing Bridge the ride would turn right and later reconnect in front of the second one Train Collision At the scene where the cabin is burning there is a moon and some stars above one of the old track areas Also at the sign for Kinney Bridge to riders left is a large open area where scenes once existed

The removed scenes included one with a group of Baldknobbers having the following conversation All right boys remember dont fire until you see the whites of their eyes A gun fires Ow You damn knocked me or you damn knockkneed Oh excuse me kids After that scene the ride encounters the Baldknobber dumping the barrel on the riders now moved to another part of the ride This was followed by a sign reading Danger Track out ahead Coming out of the tunnel riders saw what appeared to be the track mangled hanging off a cliff Just as they headed out over it the cars cut back sharply on the real track The track then reconnected with the existing track headed for the train hill

A song was created in 1972 to accompany the ride It plays throughout the ride and on the exterior of the building While waiting in the exterior queueline one can hear it along with conversations between two men exclaiming the heroic deeds of firefighters

2007 Philippine House of Representatives elections
The 2007 Philippine House of Representatives elections were held on May 14 2007 to elect members to the House of Representatives of the Philippines to serve in the 14th Congress of the Philippines from June 30 2007 until June 30 2010 The Philippines uses parallel voting for seats in the House of Representatives

In district elections 219 singlemember constituencies elect one member of the House of Representatives The candidate with the highest number of votes wins that districts seat In the partylist election the parties with at least 2 of the national vote were elected and 21 representatives were elected However later in 2007 the Supreme Court ruled in Banat vs COMELEC that the 2 quota was unconstitutional and that the sectoral representatives should comprise exactly 20 of the House This led to the increase in the number of sectoral representatives to 51

The administrationled TEAM Unity maintained control of the House of Representatives although the oppositionbacked Genuine Opposition won control of the Senate Incumbent Speaker Jose de Venecia of Pangasinan was elected Speaker after being the only one nominated 186 voted for De Venecia 1 against Eduardo Joson and 24 abstentions

The Genuine Opposition GO targeted to win at least 80 seats to be able to impeach President Gloria MacapagalArroyo however the administrations TEAM Unity prevented GO in winning several of those seats by fielding in strong candidates against GO in those districts

The administrations two main parties LakasCMD and Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino KAMPI was seen to win majority of the seats with most contests contested by the two parties This inevitably produced a split in the administration ranks on who would be their candidate for Speaker in the impending victory However the two parties were united in supporting President Arroyo and were able to prevent any impeachment proceeding against her or her allies from reaching the Senate

LakasCMD party leader and House Speaker Jose de Venecia was challenged by KAMPIs Pablo P Garcia for the speakership in the incoming 14th Congress of the Philippines which has caused a battle between administration allies Recently Garcia was accused by Paraaque City 1st District Rep Eduardo Ziacita and Manila 6th District Rep Bienvenido Abante Jr both under the party LakasCMD of using Government Service Insurance System or GSIS pension funds care of Garcias son GSIS ViceChairman General Manager and President Winston Garcia to bribe congressmen of PHP 300000 to 400000 to support his fathers speakership bid








District representatives are allocated 80 of the seats in the House

Partylist representatives are allocated 20 of the seats in the House however due to the 2 threshold and the 3seat cap rule the 20 requirement was not met On the BANAT vs COMELEC decision of the Supreme Court it declared the 2 threshold unconstitutional instead it mandated that parties surpassing the 2 threshold automatically having seats then allocating one seat for every party with less than 2 of the vote until the 20 allocation was met With the formula used this meant that the party with the highest number of votes usually gets three seats the other parties with 2 or more of the vote winning two seats and parties with less than 2 of the vote getting one seat

Lilian date
A Lilian date is the number of days since the beginning of the Gregorian Calendar on October 15 1582 regarded as Lilian date 1 It was invented by Bruce G Ohms of IBM in 1986 and is named for Aloysius Lilius who devised the Gregorian Calendar Lilian dates can be used to calculate the number of days between any two dates occurring since the beginning of the Gregorian calendar It is currently used by date conversion routines that are part of IBM Language Environment LE software

The Lilian date is only a date format it is not tied to any particular time standard Another better known date notation that is used for similar purposes is the Julian date which is tied to Universal time or some other closely related time scale such as International Atomic Time The Julian date always begins at noon Universal time and a decimal fraction may be used to represent the time of day In contrast Ohms did not make any mention of time zones or time of day in his paper
If the Lilian date was to be reckoned in Universal Time and if the Lilian date is taken to begin at midnight the Lilian date can be obtained from the Julian date by subtracting from the Julian date and ignoring the decimal fraction in the result

The current system for the Tacoma City Council was established in 1952 Prior to this date Tacomas government consisted of elected commissioners who frequently plagued the city with corruption Voters chose to replace the old system with a city council including the mayor to pass laws and a city manager to enforce them also known as the Councilmanager system The councilmanager system remains Tacomas governmental structure today

Under the Open Public Meetings Act of 1971 Washington state law requires the Tacoma City Council to allow members of the public to listen in on its meetings In 1999 Cheryl Miller sued the Council for voting down her application to serve on the Tacoma City Planning Commission during executive session during which doors were closed to the public The Washington Supreme Court agreed with Miller In Miller vs City of Tacoma the court ruled that in executive session the Council could deliberate and evaluate nominees but a vote choosing between nominees overstepped the boundaries of an evaluation Even though the vote was not a formal one it still violated the publics right to transparency Miller was compensated only for her attorney fees and court costs as the Supreme Court ruled that the council members did not break the law intentionally

This issue of public transparency has not been fully resolved Similar situations have occurred where the Tacoma City Council allegedly held informal votes on candidates in secret such as a 2010 executive session to fill two vacancies on the Council The city settled a lawsuit challenging the 2010 discussion

After laying down office as ViceChancellor in 1999 he was awarded a Senior Fellowship by the Homi Bhabha Council to pursue a study of Charaka which culminated in the publication a book The Legacy of Charaka Later on as a National Research Professor he carried out a study of Sushruta and Vagbhata and completed the series of Legacy volumes on the  Great Three of Ayurveda

In an interview Dr Valiathan had observed At this time there is no common ground where physicists chemists immunologists and molecular biologists can interact with Ayurvedic physicians Ayurveda is not only the mother of medicine but also of all life sciences in India In spite of it science has been completely divorced from Ayurveda But these are the interdisciplinary areas where advances will take place
Earlier in another article he had written To ignore the testimony of thousands of patients over many decades is reminiscent of the derisive attitude of Edward Jenners contemporaries in Gloucestershire who despised the claim of milkmaids that cow pox gave them protection from small pox When Jenner wrote to his mentor John Hunter on the observed facts and the arguments against it Hunter gave his famous reply Why think Why not experiment That applies to Ayurveda whose time to experiment has arrived

Currently Dr Valiathan is engaged in promoting research in basic sciences based on cues from Ayurvedic concepts and procedures The research in prominent institutes is being supported by government funding in A Science Initiative in Ayurveda ASIIA In his report during the seventeenth meeting of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet SACC in 2009 under the Chairmanship of Dr R Chidambaram
Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India DrValiathan lauded the support of the Indian government while presenting an update on ongoing projects ASIIA made good progress and has been taken over by the Department of Science and Technology Government of India for sustained support under a Task Force in Ayurvedic Biology which appears on the SERB website He has also given a course of video lectures on  The Ayurvedic Inheritance of India  under the NPTEL programme of the IITs of India  httpswebarchiveorgweb20151028200338httpnpteliitmacin These lectures provided the material for his book  Ayurvedic Inheritance  A Readers Companionpublished by Manipal University Press in 2017

DrValiathans contributions to medical sciences and technology have brought him many honours and awards such as the Fellowships of the Indian Academy of Sciences Indian National Science Academy National Academy of Sciences India National Academy of Medical Sciences Indian National Academy of Engineering The World Academy of Sciences American College of Cardiology the Royal College of Physicians of London and the International Union of Societies of Biomaterials and Engineering He is a Hunterian Professor of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and a Senior Member of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons of the United States and the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain The French Government has honoured him by making him a Chevalier in the order of Palmes Academiques He is a recipient of many Awards for Science Technology and Education which include the RD Birla Award OP Bhasin Award Jawaharlal Nehru Award Dhanwantari Prize Aryabhata medal Basanti Devi Amirchand Prize JC Bose medal Kerala State Science and Technology Award BC Guha Award Pinnamaneni Foundation Award Sat Pal Mittal Award GM Modi Award M V Pylee Award HK Firodia Award and the Sastra Puraskaram of the Kerala Government He received the Dr Samuel P Asper International Award from the Johns Hopkins University USA for his contributions to medical education 

Professor Valiathan served on numerous Government committees and academic councils which pertain to education medicine science and technology These include among many others the University Grants Commission Indian Council of Medical Research Science and Engineering Research Council of the DST Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and the Science Advisory Committee to the Cabinet He was the Chairman of the Committee on Bioethics of the Indian Council of Medical Research and was previously the Chairman of the State Committee for Science Technology and Environment of the Government of Kerala He is a past President of the Association of Indian Universities

Alsaceclass battleship
The Alsaceclass battleships were planned to succeed and enlarge the  The design planned for an improved Richelieu design with three triple or quadruple 380mm turrets two fore one aft Six names were proposed and two had to be chosen from this list Alsace Normandie Flandre Bourgogne two more units were not given names The laying down of the lead ship of the class Alsace was planned for 1941 with the Fall of France in 1940 none of the ships were built

In 1936 the second London naval disarmament conference failure marked the end of the international naval armament limitation policy Japan had withdrawn from the conference on January 15 Italy also declined to sign the treaty A socalled escalator clause was included at the urging of American negotiators allowing the signatory countries of the Second London TreatyFrance the United Kingdom and the United Statesto raise the battleship main artillery caliber limit from to  and the battleship Washington tonnage limit from 35000 tons to 45000 tons if Japan or Italy still refused to sign after  So the United States adopted the 16inch gun for their new fast battleship classes the United Kingdom chose to respect the Second London Naval Treaty limitations for the battleships Germany was not concerned as she had not been invited to the second London naval disarmament conference but officially the battleships and did have 380mm guns and 35000 tons So France decided to respect the limitation of 35000 tons and 380mm as long as no continental European power had overtaken them It was with these considerations in mind that the new Chef dEtatmajor Gnral de la Marine Admiral Darlan was ordered in late 1937 to study new designs for two more battleships as trials were starting to confirm some critical issue with her design especially her all forward quadruple turret main artillery and her dual purpose antiaircraft and antiship secondary artillery of relatively light caliber

Three projects were studied the first project A with the same quadruple arrangement forward as  but different secondary artillery dispositions the second project B with one quadruple turret forward and one quadruple turret aft the third project C with two fore triple turrets and one triple turret aft in every case with a 380mm caliber The project C was leading to an excess of nearly 2500 tons over the limit of 35000 tons so it was not proposed to the Chef dEtatmajor Gnral de la Marine

In June 1938 Admiral Darlan chose the project A variant 2 for the first battleship to be laid down of the second pair of Richelieuclass battleships She received the name of Clemenceau and he chose the project B variant 3 for the second ship with whose design he was much involved and gave her the name of Gascogne the French province where he was born These French Admiralty choices were tightly linked with the necessity of a maximum use of shipyards where big ships might be built

So the  in Brest Navy Yards was planned to be ready for a new battleship building in late 1938 early 1939 after the Richelieu will have to be launched or more exactly floated up It was not possible to leave the dock empty for at least six months waiting to build a Project B design battleship after it had been ordered as it would have necessitated at least one year to put up definitive drawings So the Project A design had to be chosen necessarily for the first battleship to be laid down in the Salou graving dock Thus the in SaintNazaire in which was being built Jean Bart expected to leave it for October 1940 could be used for the second battleship to be laid down Therefore Richelieu being floated up on 17 January 1939 Clemenceau was laid down this same day Eighteen months later Jean Bart left her berth nearly in sight of German vanguards on 19 June 1940 so Gascogne was never laid down

During the summer of 1939 the French intelligence services warned the French Admiralty that the keels of two German battleships supposed to displace 40000 tons and mount 406mm guns actually Plan Z H39class battleships had been laid down It was considered then that it was time to surpass the limits of 35000 tons and even 380mm On the basis of the 1938 studies on Project C new battleship designs emerged which led to the socalled Province or Alsaceclass battleships

Three types of battleships were studied all with the same main artillery arrangement two turrets forward one turret aft and the same secondary artillery arrangement 152mm caliber all on center line one triple turret forward two triple turrets in superfiring position aft between the funnel and the aft main artillery turret as on the C3 version of projects for 1938 bis program

They differed on two points

First the main artillery consists in triple 380 mm turrets for type n1 in 406mm triple turrets for type n2 in 380 mm quadruple turrets for type n3

Second the anti aircraft artillery consisting in every case of dual mountings of 100mm caliber socalled pseudo turrets would have counted eight mountings on types n 1 and 2 twelve mountings on type n 3

The armour is nearly the same belt 330mm on type n1 and n2 350mm on type n3 upper armoured deck 170180mm lower armoured deck 40mm and the propulsion assuring the same speed 315knots as  so the length of the hull the power of propulsion machinery and the Washington tonnage are varying from 252 m and 40000 tons for the type n1 256 m and 42500 tons for the type n2 to 265 m and 45000 tons for the type n3

As seen above the type n1 would have been similar to s for the main artillery in arrangement and in caliber and an antiship secondary artillery which would have counted one triple turret less but with a disposition on an axial line the broadside would have been 50 more powerful and the antiaircraft artillery with a slightly bigger caliber 100mm instead of 90mm would have counted the same number of barrels It also may be described as something between  with one more 381 mm gun and the s with a main artillery of only 380mm caliber

The type n2 would have been similar to the  and battleships regarding the main armament in caliber and in arrangement The top speed would have been higher 30kn instead of 28kn for the US Navy battleships concerned with consequently a longer hull more horsepower and an enlarged displacement The choice of a dualcaliber secondary artillery instead of a dualpurpose one is characteristic of the Continental European navies at the beginning of the Second World War the lack of a robust light antiaircraft battery is also consistent with contemporary practice that was soon outstripped by events

The type n3 would have retained a distinguishing feature of French capital ships the quadruple turret The French Navy advocated such a battery arrangement consistently incorporating it into the designs of the proposed and classes of battleship in the First World War and then bringing it into practice on the Dunkerque Richelieu and Gascogneclasses The secondary artillery would have been near of which will have been fitted on as completed post war 9  152mm and 24  100mm except the lack of fourteen AA 57mm dual mountings and twenty 20mm single mountings

The French Admiralty is reported to have chosen the type n1 the nearest of Richelieu design and discarded the type n2 because of the delays to perfect the 406mm guns a new device for the French Navy and considered the type n3 dimensions excessive being nearly those of s 270 m  45000 tons

The first unit was intended to be laid down on 1941 in the Penhot shipyards where the transatlantic liner  and later the battleship had been built and where the was being built However this choice would have deferred the building of the second aircraft carrier of the  clearly showing the higher priority granted in this time to battleships over aircraft carriers by the French Admiralty

The second unit would have had to be laid down on 1942 in a new dock which was intended to be built in the Brest Navy Yards

The names of two French provinces would have been chosen from among Alsace Normandie Flandre and Bourgogne but with the 1940 France defeat these battleships were never ordered no work was ever begun and no material stored French province names were used for French capital ships at the time such as s and s They had also been considered for nuclear attack submarines and are nowadays in use for Aquitaineclass second generation stealth frigates

Hersheys Kissables
Hershey Kissables were a chocolate candy sold by The Hershey Company from late 2005 to 2009 Comparable to MMs Hershey Kissables were shaped like miniature Hersheys Kisses and were coated in a thick sugar shell

The basic colors were red orange yellow green and blue Holiday versions were also made in pastels for Easter pink and white for Valentines and red and green for Christmas In mid2007 Hersheys introduced a dark chocolate version called Kissables Dark which featured more subdued colors and a semisweet interior

Hershey ceased production of Kissables in July 2009

In 2007 the Hershey Company began to change the ingredients of some of its products to replace the relatively expensive cocoa butter with cheaper fats Hersheys changed the description of the product from candy coated milk chocolate to chocolate candy and altered the packaging and product ingredients According to United States Food and Drug Administration food labeling laws these modified recipes could not be legally described as milk chocolate

The ingredients in 2005 were milk chocolate sugar cocoa butter chocolate nonfat milk milk fat lactose soy lecithin PGPR and artificial flavors sugar red 40 yellow 5 yellow 6 blue 1 and carnauba wax

Telefios was a Scottish Gaeliclanguage news programme broadcast on both Grampian Television and Scottish Television from 1992 to 2000

Its name is a portmanteau of the word fios meaning knowledge or information and telebhisean television

Although not strictly a local news bulletin the programme concentrated mainly on Western Isles news and specifically Gaelic interest news stories from elsewhere

Fiveminute bulletins were shown on weekday lunchtimes and later in the early evening while a supplementary halfhour review programme Telefios na Seachduinn was broadcast on Saturday lunchtime

It is sometimes wrongly stated that Telefios was actually the first Scottish Gaelic news programme In fact Criomagan meaning little bits was broadcast during the late 1980s and early 1990s by Grampian Television

Following the axing of Telefios in 2000 no Scots Gaelic television news programmes were broadcast until September 2008 when the Gaelic digital channel BBC Alba launched a nightly halfhour programme entitled An L and a weekly hourlong review programme entitled Seachd L

<doc id="7712849" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712849" title="Machismo">
Machismo
Machismo   from Spanish and Portuguese macho male is the sense of being manly and selfreliant the concept associated with a strong sense of masculine pride an exaggerated masculinity It is associated with a mans responsibility to provide for protect and defend his family

The word has a long history in both Spain and Portugal as well as in Spanish and Portuguese languages It was originally associated with the ideal societal role men were expected to play in their communities most particularly Iberian languagespeaking societies and countries in Portuguese and Spanish is a strictly masculine term derived from the Latin masclus meaning male today or  cf Portuguese and nowobsolete for humans  macho and  in their most common sense are used for males of nonhuman animal species Machos in Iberiandescended cultures are expected to possess and display bravery courage and strength as well as wisdom and leadership and ser macho literally to be a macho was an aspiration for all boys

During the womens liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s the term began to be used by Latin American feminists to describe male aggression violence and toxic masculinity The term was used by Latina feminists and scholars to criticize the patriarchal structure of gendered relations in Latino communities Their goal was to describe a particular Latin American brand of patriarchy

 in Spanish or in Portuguese or the English mixture of both but not a proper word in any of the previously mentioned languages caballerismo is a Latin American understanding of manliness that focuses more on honour and chivalry The meaning of caballero is gentleman derived from the one who follows a code of honour like knights used to do or shares certain values and ideals associated with them that included among others like a particular pride in honour treating women kindly with especial delicacy and attention
Latin American scholars have noted that positive descriptors of machismo resemble the characteristics associated with the concept of caballerosidad Understandings of machismo in Latin American cultures are not all negative they also involve the characteristics of honour responsibility perseverance and courage related to both individual and group interaction Studies show Latin American men understand masculinity to involve considerable childcare responsibilities politeness respect for womens autonomy and nonviolent attitudes and behaviors In this way machismo comes to mean both positive and negative understanding of Latin American male identity within the immigrant context Therefore machismo like all social constructions of identity should be understood as having multiple layers

The word originates from the Spanish word  Spanish for horseman refers to a chivalric masculine code of behavior Note that the English term also stems from the Latin root caballus through the French chevalier Like the English chivalric code developed out of a medieval sociohistorical class system in which people of wealth and status owned horses for transportation and other forms of horsepower whereas the lower classes did not It was also associated with the class of knights in the feudal system In Spanish referred to a landowning colonial gentleman of high station who was master of estates andor ranches

There is controversy surrounding the concept of machismo as originally from Spanish and Portuguese descent The use of Spanish and Portuguese produces historical colonial connotations through its promotion of Spanish and Portuguese masculine social construction when the term should be used to describe specific Latin American historical masculinities However the word machismo does resemble words in Spanish and Portuguese language which is the cause why it is often associated with Spain and Portugal In addition by identifying machismo as a form of Europeanness it offers legitimacy to the concept of a wicked formed of the same Western hypermasculinity known to Protestant Reformederived cultures and subjugates Latin Americas understanding of itself and its cultural history and peculiarities

For example the use of  Cavalheirismoto mean only the positive characteristics of machismo is imbued with feudal and colonial connotations relating to colonial power relations This is because the origin of the word resides in feudal Spanish descriptions of landlords that reached through and into the colonial era exalts European culture in comparison to the socalled Latin American machismo animalesque irrational violent backward It cannot be avoided in Portuguese as  the word for the more acceptable parts of machismo is itself a loanword from Spanish presenting a palatalization process that Portuguese did not experience the Portuguese word for a horseman is  and for horsemanship it has 

Researchers are concerned regarding the unbalanced representation of machismo within Latin American cultures and are now focused on creating a balanced representation They have repeatedly pointed out the positive characteristics consistent with machismo or  nurturance protection of the family and its honor dignity wisdom hard work responsibility spirituality and emotional connectedness Latin American scholars propose there are really two different constructs within machismo one positive construct and one negative construct The negative construct of machismo is based on the traditional Western concept of hypermasculinity and is predominant within mainstream discourse without an acknowledgement towards its resemblance towards hypermasculinty s characteristics are exalted while machismos characteristics are seen as predominantly negative

The other side of machismo the positive side   refers to a connection to family and chivalry However the focus on the negative aspects and avoidance of positive aspects of machismo coincides with the concept of marginalization and powerlessness of Hispanic and Latino and more broadly Romancespeaking European culturederived narratives This is because the focus on the negative and avoidance of the positive creates a power dynamic that legitimizes mainstream American hegemonic masculinity as the correct masculinity and subjugates machismo as a degenerated nonwhite form of abuse against women and backwardness As a result it creates a sense of powerlessness within Latino males in their expression of their masculinity

The phenomena of genderbased belief systems having negative and positive effects is described as ambivalent sexism which is made of hostile sexism and benevolent sexism

Academics have noted that there are consequences of only having a negative definition for Hispanic and Latino masculinity in popular literature Researchers have suggested that according to the Eurocentric and to a certain degree antiCatholic andor Nordicist views dominant in mainstream white American culture Latin American manifestations of machismo represent all that is wrong in a man Latino academics have used this argument to explain why Latino male youth struggle in academic institutions and have high rates of criminality These are the same discourses that argue that Latino masculinity machismo is defined by violence recklessness and misogyny Accordingly they link these expressions as contributing to a lack of interest in academics as well as behavioural struggles in schools for Latino male youth

Throughout popular literature the term has continued to be associated with negative characteristics such as sexism misogyny chauvinism hypermasculinity and hegemonic masculinity Scholars characterize macho men as violent rude womanizing and prone to alcoholism Authors from a various disciplines typified macho men as domineering through intimidation seducing and controlling women and children through violence and intimidation

For example in American literature an example of machismo comes from Tennessee Williams character Stanley Kowalski an egotistical brotherinlaw from A Streetcar Named Desire In the play and 1951 film adaptation Stanley epitomizes the tough alphamale hypermasculine archetype socially and physically dominating and imposing his will upon his wife and her sister Blanche Dubois Bound up with Stanleys aggressive and occasionally misogynistic views is a strong sense of pride and honor which leads to his hatred of Blanche

In the play A View from the Bridge by Arthur Miller one of the main characters Eddie is a classic type who displays machismo He wants to be the best of the men around him and when beaten becomes very agitated and increasingly irrational The negative stereotypes depicted in American literature are not representative of all the different layers of machismo

Machismo has been influenced and supported by many different factors The Catholic religion plays a vital role to many within the Spanish community For this reason the male dominated world that is often referenced in the Bible is seen among the people Examples can be found throughout the Bible showing how women should be submissive to their husbands Unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee Genesis 316 The ideologies that the man is stronger the moneymaker and the protector all back up the mindset that wives must listen to their husbands

The revolution of copper mining sets the tone of traditional masculinity The industrious labor performed by the working class male is accredited by status amongst peers and ability to provide for the family Men who work in the mines are often away from their families the majority of the time so they engage in homosociality The homosocial leisure activities that the workers engage in consist of gambling soccer and alcohol Womens presence in social settings is not prominent so mens dominance and inevitable homosocial interactions create kinship and brotherhood Exploitation of masculinity through the context of miners is prominent and embodied by Chilean males

As a colony of the US Puerto Rico tends to take on the same progressive movements as US These movements include LGBTQ rights minority rights and equality In regards to equality and what separates men and women gender roles determine what is socially acceptable in different geographical areas In Puerto Rico the machismo culture has or had a strong presence Men were to work outside the home manage the finances and make the decisions Women were to be subordinate to their husbands and be the homemakers Women would often would have to be dependent on men for everything Growing up boys are taught to the machismo code girls are taught the marianismo code Machismo is a term originating in the early 1930s and 40s best defined as having masculinity and Pride Machismo is a factor challenged among different groups due to how an ideal man is expected to be portrayed which builds pressure Mentally men may feel the need to take up more opportunities to meet expectations such as supporting the home or maintaining employment leading to stress This may also take a toll as physically well straining to be strong and overexerting the body or the opposite of putting on weight by not having the desired physique and feeling inferior This is further expressed through Puerto Ricans Americans outside the island

However the roles are beginning to shift as womens rights and equality movements sweep the mainland Puerto Rico is beginning to feel the effects While Puerto Ricans may be motivated by the progressive of the mainland they base their movements off of their situations in Puerto Rico Beginning in the 1950s the employment rate for women began to rise as the employment rate fell due to the islands industrialization Also during the 1950s to 1980s the field of the white collar women emerged furthering the rise in women employment However women were not released from their homemaker duties because they had a job In fact women were now expected to contribute to the households finances and be the homemaker This caused a shift in what was acceptable in households Men used to be able to come and go as they pleased as the women were dependent on them however after contributing to the household acquiring more education and being the homemaker women became more independent and conscious They no longer tolerated unfaithful men controlling men and violent men This caused great inner conflict with the idea of the machismo culture In present day society this machismo culture is still oppressed as Puerto Rico in 2016 was the only place where women made more than men at 103 for every 1

In Chicago where there is a big Puerto Rican community Puerto Ricans are feeling threatened of their American dream Young Puerto Rican women are expected to stay at home reproductively as well as for the cultural reasons of productively being at home There are rules made by Latin families that young women should not be influenced by the dangers of outside for the portrayal of young women to be sexualized or vulnerable They are raised with these strict rules because some women experience pregnancy at a young age and are not familiar to care for both themselves nor the responsibilities of a new child Young women may even lack support from their own household families and are blamed for not being properly educated Puerto Rican families influenced by American culture may express to bend traditional rules These families do what they believe is best for their family and further educate about sexual education and learn while virginity is valued until marriage

LGBTQ community is also a conflicting issue to the machismo culture Puerto Rico is known for its strong Christian community along with having a smaller Jewish and Muslim community as well Due to changing times and influence from America the LGBTQ movement has been a strong force for equality which in Puerto Rico has not always been accepted and even harmed in the process due to difference A new term to differentiate gender is Latinx and Latine a variant used to pronounce easily throughout Latin America is a gender neutral form of addressing someone compared to the familiar male Latino or female Latina Minorities are treated differently in Puerto Rico despite the blending of three races Puerto Ricans face racism amongst themselves in their community and at work solely based on their color of their skin People with even the slightest pigment were not considered white and segregation exist within the island where minorities may live in different regions of the island with others of color

Therefore the preColumbian use of the word macho had to do with wisdom and leadership that was worthy of imitation while gender was not involved When the Spanish came their use of the word was strictly masculine Therefore after the Spanish invasion a new word idea and concept was born that a macho was a masculine leader who was enlightened and worthy of imitation It was always a positive term Therefore in Mexico the use of the word macho may provoke confusion if it is not used precisely or in context

Machismo is a source of pride for men and they must prove their manliness by upholding their dominance in their reputation and their household Machismo comes from the assertion of male dominance in everyday life Examples of this would be men dominating their wives controlling their children and demanding the utmost respect from others in the household Machismo has become deeply woven in Cuban society and have created barriers for women to reach full equality The reason for this is the patriarchy that runs high in Cuban society Cubas patriarchal society stems from the fact that Spain has had a history of using brutal war tactics and humiliation as a means to keep and establish their power Tomas de Torquemada who ruled as a grand inquisitor under King Ferdinand and Queen Elizabeth of Spain used degrading and humiliating forms of torture to get information out of prisoners Men like Torquemada create the domino effect throughout history of repressive and toxic masculinity that has plagued Cuban society Machismo is also a modernized ideology from Islamic and African cultures of structured hierarchy of only male chief subchiefs

In Uva de Aragon Clavijos novel El Caiman Ante El Espejo  Clavijo claims that Cubans feel more power from the genital organs of previous male generals like General Antonio Maceo Grajales of the Cuban fight for independence Grajales was the embodiment of male power and dominance Due to the long list of past male Cuban leaders like Fidel Castro Even though he represented a revolution he was still a powerful and dominating man who ruled over the people In the point of view of Clavijo militarism and caudillismo are what is to blame for Cuban machismo as it established the ideology of the leadership of the strongman which proved to be successful in Castro becoming victorious in his revolution Thus furthering that a male dominated political society is superior Despite Castros leading a socialist revolution it only seems to reinforce machocontrol over the Cuban people specifically for Cuban woman who have yet to occupy any established political positions

The idea of the male ego where the male is symbolized as hypermasculine virile strong paternalistic aggressive sexually dominant and unfaithful is reinforced by the teachings of the Catholic Church the main religion practiced in Cuba and Latina America in general According to Catholic Church teachings the female should be a virgin and faithful to her husband but by contrast the male has more sexual freedom During colonial times a females chastity and demureness were linked to the familys societal standings new while the males were expected and sometimes pressured into proving their sexual prowess by having multiple partners There was a duality in the expression of love Men were supposed to express between physical loves while women were expected to only express spiritual love Even after marriage carnal love was frowned upon if the woman expressed it too vigorously instead she was supposed to be more delighted by the possibility of having and raising children as a means to express the love

Because of the objectification of women domestic violence often ignored when women decide to seek help from the police Domestic abuse victims are given psychological counseling as a way to cope with their trauma but little is done criminally to solve the problem Domestic Abuse cases or other violent crimes committed against women are very rarely reported on by the media and the government does not release statistics that show the people the extent of the crimes The Cuban Revolution changed some of the ways the people of Cuba viewed women Fidel Castro in his own words saw that the women were going through a revolution within the revolution and established the Federation of Cuban Women FMC This organization headed by Vilma Espin Castros sister in law helped women establish themselves better into the working world and in womens right issues The FMC has continually advocated for women rights and in 1997 created the Grupo Nacional para la Prevencion y Atencion de la Violencia Familiar a national group whose purpose is to study and find measures on how to get help for the women who fall victim to domestic violence With the help of the FMC and the Grupo Nacional para la Prevencion y Atencion de la Violencia Familiar women can file claims against their abusers at the Office of Victim Rights They are also now able to get access to sexual abuse therapies This by no way solves the issue of domestic abuse but it is a turning point for the Cuban women who are now no longer feel powerless in the fight

Because Machismo is so entrenched into the very systems that keep women oppressed women in Cuba dont hold political or monetary positions of power While there are 489 of women in Cuban Congress the political group that holds the most power is The Cuban Communist Party which is made up of only 7 of women In many cases women who do have professional jobs are often funded by the Cuban state meaning they only receive about 30 a month This means that women are employed but do not and cannot hold positions of power due to the men in power who benefit from staying in power Machismo is mostly ingrained in domestic environments so while 89 of women over 25 have received a secondary education if a woman is a doctor or a lawyer even after all the work she has done during the day at home she is still expected to cook and clean and be the primary caretaker of the children Many feminist scholars have described this phenomena which takes place in other cultures as the second shift based on a book by Arlie Russell Hochschild by the same name Cuban males see no problem in leaving all the housework to their wives while they are allowed to go out for drinks with their friends Machismo characteristics in men have given them power over women in the home which leaves certain women more vulnerable to domestic violence committed against them Cubans are now beginning to leave state employment to search for jobs in tourism These jobs produce a great deal of profit because of the wealthy tourists that visit the island and leave good tips Cubans who were once professors and doctors are now leaving their old jobs to become bartenders and some to even drive cabs these tourism jobs are primarily held by men machismo has once again given men more financial power

From the inception of machismo from both the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire machismo translates to mean macho and refers to male oppression over women Moreover machismo is an allencompassing term for the dominion of the elite man over the other In this case the other refers to women of all races and economic status whom the macho sees as an object to protect and effeminate and gay men Men who do not perform their gender in the normalized way are referred to as maricon a derogatory word meaning queer or fag because their maleness is being called into question Many of the antiLGBT acceptance stems from The Cuban Revolution and Fidel Castro who had strong views over masculinity and how it fit in his idea of militarism Fidel Castro once said on homosexuality in a 1965 interview with American journalist Lee Lockwood A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant communist should be That same year gay men in Cuba were being sent to labor camps because their sexuality made them unfit to be involved in military service Machismo has not only been a tool used to restrict the way women should behave but also how men who do not adhere to societal norms should behave as well However in the more recent years the establishment of CENESEX National Centre for Sexual Education has been established so that the population of Cuba can more readily accept sexual diversity of all kinds especially in terms of the LGBT people CENESEX has grown in part because of the Cuban government and with the help Mariela CastroEspin daughter of Raul Castro 16th president of Cuba and niece to Fidel Castro CENESEX has sought to decrease homophobia in Cuba by increasing sexual awareness by holding social gatherings like anti homophobic rallies

In 1975 A new Cuban Law came onto the island The Codigo de la Familia Family Law It became into effect on March 8 1975 just 15 years after the Cuban Revolution The new Family Law of 1975 really helped a lot of women get jobs on the island and provided children with protection under the law so that child begging and homelessness amongst children was practically eradicated The law also stated that it was required for both sexes to participated in domestic chores But just because the law was passed does not mean it was heavily reinforced particularly in the domestic sphere One of the aspects of the new family law was not only to create equality outside of the home but inside of it as well This new family law was not received well by many people in Cuba particularly men who backlashed against the law These grievances reflected in the media that was made in Cuba particularly during the Golden Age of Cuban Cinema

Hasta Cierto Punto directed by Toms Gutirrez Alea is a movie that follows Oscar an educated playwright who is currently writing a movie on the effects of machismo in Cuban Society In the opening scene of this movie there is an interview with a young black man who is asked about machismo The young man laughs and says in the movie Oh theyve managed to change my attitudes on that score Im certainly changed up to a certain point Ive probably changed up to 80 now Maybe they can work on me and change me to 87 But they will never never get me up to 100 no way These attitudes on screen reflect that of many men in Cuba and their attitudes towards women having more equality in everyday life The film that Oscar was meant to write for is directed by his friend Arturo Both are well educated men with stable careers in their fields wives cars and other luxuries However Arturo believes that the issue of Machismo is most directly a working class problem and that it is up to educated men such as himself and Oscar to raise consciousness on the issue Oscar and Arturo use working class dockworkers to use as research for their film This is where they meet Lina a workingclass woman who is in charge of the dock workers In the beginning of the film she is represented to be tough on her workers and is well respected amongst all the men she works with Oscar the screenwriter finds himself enamored with her tough attitudes which is very different than women he has met before However as the movie goes on we see Oscar increasingly find himself frustrated with Linas free spirit and workingclass downtoearth personality Oscar sees that this is not the kind of woman he is used to Throughout the movie although Oscar is having an affair on his wife he finds himself being more empathetic to workingclass struggles in a way that his friend Arturo isnt Arturo still believes that all working class men are just macho brutes The films dynamic on working class and bourgeois machismo is very telling of Cuban society and how class reflects on the attitudes towards machismo It also problematizes bourgeois men who believe they are intellectually above everyone else including issues on machismo and womens equality

Many women identify that machismo is perpetuated through the pressure to raise children a certain way and instill social constructions of gender throughout a childs development This is complemented by the distant fatherson relationship in which intimacy and affection are typically avoided These aspects set up the environment through which the ideology perpetuates itself It creates a sense of inferiority that drives boys to reach an unattainable level of masculinity a pursuit often validated by the aggressive and apathetic behavior they observe in the men around them and ultimately leading them to continue the cycle

There is accumulating evidence that supports the relation between the way men are traditionally socialized to be masculine and its harmful mental and physical health consequences Respectively machismo is sociocultural term associated with male and female socialization in Hispanic cultures it is a set of values attitudes and beliefs about masculinity Although the construct of machismo holds both positive and negative aspects of masculinity emerging research suggests the gender role conceptualization of machismo has associations with negative cognitiveemotional factors ie depression symptoms trait anxiety and anger cynical hostility among Hispanic populations

Similarly a welldocumented disparity notes Latino adolescents reporting higher levels of depression than other ethnic backgrounds Research suggests this may be associated to adolescent perceived gender role discrepancies which challenge the traditional perceptions of gender role ie machismo

Enhanced understanding on associations between the gender role conceptualizations of machismo with negative cognitiveemotional factors may prove invaluable to mental health professionals According to Fragoso and Kashubeck if a therapist notes that a client seems to endorse high levels of machismo that therapist might explore whether the client is experiencing high levels of stress and depression Therefore conducting a gender role assessment would help a therapist assess a clients level of machismo and whether aspects of gender role conflict are present

Many counseling psychologists are interested in further studies for comprehending the connection between counseling for males and topics such as sexrole conflicts and male socialization This high demand stems from such psychologists abilities to make patients aware how some inflexible and preestablished ideals regarding sexroles may be detrimental to peoples way of regarding new changes in societal expectancies fostering relationships and physical and mental health Professionals such as Thomas Skovholt psychology professor at the University of Minnesota claim that more research needs to be done in order to have efficient mediation for men through counseling

Several elements of machismo are considered psychologically harmful for men Competition is a widely talked about subject in this area as studies show that there are both positive and negative connotations to it Many benefits arise from healthy competition such as teambuilding abilities active engagement pressure handling critical thinking and the strive to excel As these qualities and traits are highly valued by many they are widely taught to children from a young age both at school and at home Scholars also argue that men could be mentally harmed from competition such as the one experienced by many at their job as their impetus to rise above their peers and fulfill the breadwinner concept in many societies can cause stress jealousy and psychological strain

Machismo as a cultural factor is substantially associated with crime violence and lawlessness independently of the structural control variables 2627 One key aspect of Machismos association to violence is its influence in a mans behavior towards proving his strength 57 While strength and fortitude are recognized as key components to the stereotype of machismo demonstrations of violence and aggressive actions have become almost expected of men and have been justified as desirable products of being tough and macho It can be implied that if you are violent you are strong and thus more of a man than those who back down or do not fight

Violent encounters can stem from the desire to protect his family friends and particularly his female relatives that are vulnerable to the machismo actions of other men 59 However through jealousy competitiveness and pride violent encounters are also often pursued to demonstrate his strength to others A mans insecurities can be fueled by a number of pressures These range from societal pressures to be a man to internal pressures of overcoming an inferiority complex 59 This can translate into actions that devalue feminine characteristics and overemphasize the characteristics of strength and superiority attributed to masculinity 59

In many cases a mans position of superiority over a female partner can lead him to gain control over different aspects of her life Since women are viewed as subservient to men in many cultures men often have power to decide whether his wife can work study socialize participate in the community or even leave the house With little opportunity for attaining an income minimal means to get an education and the few people they have as a support system many women become dependent on their husbands financially and emotionally This leaves many women particularly vulnerable to domestic violence both because it is justified through this belief that men are superior and thus are free to express that superiority and because women cannot leave such an abusive relationship since they rely on their husbands to live

The power difference in the relationship between a man and a woman not only creates the social norm of machismo but by consequence also creates the social concept of marianismo which is the idea that women are meant to be pure and wholesome Marianismo derives its origins from Spanish Colonization as many social constructs from Latin America do It emphasizes the perfect femininity of a woman and her virginity One could argue that in the similar manner of Patriarchy the man is the head of the household while the fragile woman is submissive and tends to remain behind the scenes This brings to focus the idea that women are inferior and are thus dependent on their husbands As a result they not only rely on their husbands for financial support but in the social realm are put at the same level as children under age 12 mentally ill persons and spendthrifts 265 By way of tradition not only are women given limited opportunities in what they are able to do and to be but they are also viewed as people that cannot even take care of themselves Getting married provides a woman with security under her husbands success but also entails a lifelong commitment towards serving her husband and her children

While social pressures and expectations play huge roles in the perpetuation of the marianismo construct this ideology is also taught to girls as they grow up They learn the importance of performing domestic labor and household chores such as cooking and cleaning because this will be the role they will play in their future families They are taught that these must be done well so that they can adequately serve their families and avoid punishment and discipline by their authoritative husbands

Some experts hypothesize since there is a lack of empirical research on genderrole conflicts that men might suffer from such conflicts because of their fear of femininity

Professionals from several universities in the United States developed a model around this hypothesis with six behavioral patterns


The model was developed around the idea that these six patterns are all influenced by mens the fear of femininity This theory was then partially supported by a study done by five professionals Some tools already created to measure genderrole attitudes include the Personal Attitudes Questionnaire the Bem Sex Role Inventory the Attitudes Toward Women Scale and the Attitudes Toward the Males Role Scale Evidence suggests that genderroles conflicts inflicted by machismo can lead males who were raised with this mentality and or live in a society in which machismo is prevalent to suffer high levels of anxiety and low selfesteem Additionally studies found that many males facing such conflicts are subject to experience anger depression and substance abuse

One implication of the Machismo concept is the pressure for a man to be sexually experienced Male infidelity is of common practice in many cultures as men are not as expected to hold nearly the same level of chastity as women are Meanwhile girls are oftentimes brought up to tolerate an unfaithful partner since it is a part of the machismo culture As such this puts populations at risk for transmitting STIs as men seek out multiple sexual partners with little interference from their wives or from society The risk is further heightened by the lack of condom use by men who are both miseducated about the effectiveness of a condoms protection against STIs and the belief that this wouldnt happen to them This mentality also deters men from getting themselves tested to know if they are HIVpositive which leads them to even spread STIs without even knowing it

For men in many Latin American countries their perceived level of masculinity determines the amount of respect they receive in society Because homosexual men are associated with feminine attributes they are perceived with lower level of masculinity and as a result they receive less respect than heterosexual men in society This in turn can limit their ability to achieve upward social mobility to be taken seriously or to hold positions of power Also because homosexuality is seen as taboo or even sinful in many Christian denominations homosexual men tend to lack a support system leaving many unable express their true sexuality To deal with such oppression they must make the choice either to conform to heteronormativity and repress their homosexual identity to assimilate towards masculine ideals and practices while maintaining their homosexual identity in private or to openly express their homosexuality and suffer ostracization from society This creates a hierarchy of homosexuality corresponding to how much respect power and social standing a homosexual man can expect to receive The more a man acts in accordance with the stereotypical heterosexual hegemonic masculinity the higher on the social hierarchy they are

On the lower end of the hierarchy are the locas or maricones These men are those that are deemed as effeminate because they do not live by the social construct of hegemonic masculinity and also publicize their homosexuality As such they receive little respect both in society in general and among the LGBT community Many homosexual men resist being associated with the loca stereotype by either demonstrating overt masculinity or by ridiculing and distancing themselves from other loca men A common Puerto Rican saying demonstrates this resistance mejor un drogadicto que un pato better a drug addict than a faggot

Homosexuality is perceived as negative or weak within the machista ideal It doesnt fit into the masculine attributes that machismo extols This often leads homosexual or bisexual men living in machista communities to be reluctant about being open about their sexuality because of the negative connotation associated with it Familismo which is an idea in Latin cultures that ties an individual with a commitment to his or her family and homophobia can sometimes cause in homosexual individuals the repression of sexual identity family separation and to hide their sexuality Such situations may hinder personal shame and secret sexual actions that increases HIV and STI risk in Latino homosexuals Regularly experiencing homophobia and low selfesteem have a connection with sexual risk A survey conducted by the Virginia Commonwealth University found that men who had high machismo values or characteristics were more than five times more probable to participate in activities or behave in a way to put them at risk for contracting HIV or an STI

Because of the negative connotations that come with identifying as homosexual the definition of homosexuality has become ambiguous By genderizing sexual practices only men who are sexually penetrated during sex locas are considered homosexual while men who are the sexual penetrators during sex can maintain their heterosexual identity Also in many Latin American countries the media portrayal of homosexual men often play into the stereotype of an effeminate flamboyant male role As a result the idea of a masculine homosexual man remains almost unheard of and privatized by the community and by society which allows this stereotype of homosexual men as locas to persist

Machismo can also pressure men to defend the wellbeing of his loved ones his community and his country It allows him to perform altruistic acts in order to provide protection to others In the past and even in many current societies where people rely on subsistence agriculture and economy to survive machismo helped provide men with the courage to drive off potential threats to protect his land and his crop Today this contributes to the substantial gender gap in the makeup of military and armed forces around the world even considering growing female representation in the military today Beyond the realm of the armed forces however the machismo ideology can also drive men to work towards service because he is in a superior position which enables him to demonstrate his success by offering his own strengths to help others Their dependence on him can validate his ego and help maintain this difference in power

Another approach to machismo is that of the caballerismo ideology that because a man is the head of the household he is responsible for the wellbeing of the members of his family This describes the call for a man to be chivalrous nurturing and protective of his loved ones It translates to the belief that a true man would never act violent towards his wife or children but would instead ensure that no harm come to them Machismo seen through this approach inspires men to create harmonious interpersonal relationships through respect for self and others This allows fathers to maintain positive intimate relationships with his children and share a more egalitarian relationship with his wife

In many cultures in the world there is a longstanding tradition that the man is the head of the household and is responsible for providing for the family In some cases this may mean he is the only parent working in paidwork while in other conditions this may mean both parents are working but the man is expected to be the primary income contributor In either case part of the masculine identity and his selfrespect is defined by his ability to provide for his family If he is unable to do so or if he brings home less money than that of his wife his position as head of the family is challenged In some cultures this may mean ultimate shame for him if he cannot fulfill this role that being unable to find work meant that there is no recognition even to his humanity  Those who do not work are like dead people 212 Beyond providing economic support for his family a man engaging in paidwork is seen as honorable because he is sacrificing time and energy that he could be spending with his family These are costs that cannot be repaid and thus are an priceless investment on his part towards the wellbeing of his family unit

Machismo changes some dynamics of life in a way have both positive and negative effects For example machismo grants women authority in the home but at the expense of a mans relationship to his children and work related stress having worked long hours

In the traditional household the man is expected to work and provide for his family while his wife stays home to care for the children As such fathers are seen as a distant authority figure to his children while mothers assume the majority of responsibility in this domestic realm and thus gain agency and the ultimate respect of her children With this female empowerment decisions in the household can take on a more egalitarian approach where mothers can have equal say in the household Meanwhile the machismo mentality in men as a provider and protector of the family can inspire him to persevere through challenges introduced by work

Within each of our memories there Is the Image of a father who worked long hours suffered to keep his family alive united and who struggled to maintain his dignity Such a man had little time for concern over his masculinity Certainly he did not have ten children because of his machismo but because he was a human being poor and without access to birth control

Machismo ideology may be viewed as beneficial to women in that it encourages their husbands to provide for and protect them and their children Further by subordinating their needs to those of their family women earn a lifetime of support from their husbands and children and in this way gain some control in the family 90 Because fathers are typically more invested in paid labor mothers typically spend more time with the children and thus gain credibility in important decisions such as a childs schooling or a childs health care Nevertheless in these machist households the fathers will have the last word whenever they choose to as they are the breadwinners and all the family ultimately depends on them for survival In case of a separation or divorce it is typically the mothers who suffer the most since they did not invest their time in their career and will probably still have to provide and care for the children

Despite machismos documented history in Hispanic and Latin American communities research throughout the years has shown a shift in prevalence among younger generations In Brazil researchers found that while the majority of young men interviewed held traditional attitudes on gender roles and machismo there was a small sample of men that did not agree with these views

Acculturation and education have been proposed to be a factor in how machismo is passed down through Hispanic and Latino generations in the United States According to researchers who measured selfreported levels of machismo among 72 university students 37 whom identified as Hispanic the somewhat unique population of collegeeducated students who have been heavily influenced by egalitarian attitudes values and norms may explain why ethnicity did not directly predict machismo attitudes in two studies Because education and acculturation of American values in Latino individuals may result in the development of attitudes supporting genderequality this demonstrates how machismo may gradually decline over time in the United States

Moreover researchers analyzed a large crosssectional survey among 36 countries including 6 Latin American countries from 2009 and discovered countries with less gender inequality had adolescents that supported attitudes of genderequality though females were more likely to support nontraditional gender roles than males While the mean score of genderequality attitudes was 4983 with lower scores indicating less gender equality attitudes Latin American countries scored the following Chile 51554 Colombia 49416 Dominican Republic 43586 Guatemala 48890 Mexico 45596 Paraguay 48370 Machismo is associated with gender inequality Therefore this study suggests that Latino individuals living in their native countries may support more machismo attitudes than Latino immigrants adopting US values of gender equality

Masuda also studied selfreported measures of sexual relationship power among 40 recently immigrated Latino couples found data against machismo attitudes since women perceived themselves to have greater control and decisionmaking roles in their relationships This serves as a stark contrast because machismo traditionally creates a relationship dynamic that relegates women to submissive roles and men to dominant roles Again acculturation may play a role in this dynamic shift because the couples averaged about 8 years since immigrating to the United States

Acculturation has not only been associated with a decline in machismo it has appeared to affect how it manifests and how it is transferred through generations Recently Mexican American adolescents in romantic relationships demonstrated adaptive machismo which consist of the positive qualities of machismo such as emotional availability demonstrations of affection desire to financially care for a female partner responsibility in childrearing andor to the community or friends during conflict resolution scenarios Furthermore while Mexican American adolescent males were found to have certain values and attitudes such as caballerismo passed down by their families machismo was not one of them Because families are not teaching machismo this implies that it may be learned from sources separate from the family unit such as peers and the media Ultimately these findings suggest that machismo is changing in terms of its prevalence manifestation and socialization

Founded in 1969 the Young Lords were an organization of Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalists in Chicago and New York City Working toward the liberation of all oppressed people the Young Lords opposed racism capitalism and assimilationist ideologies Seeking selfdetermination and community control of institutions and land the organizations leaders made a distinct choice to denounce machismo in their revised 13Point Program and Platform Previously reading We want equality for women Machismo must be revolutionary Not oppressive the organization moved toward a more radical position stating We want equality for women Down with machismo and male chauvinism This revised version of the organizations ideological platform was published in their newspaper Palante in November 1970  thirteen months following the original platforms publication in October 1969

The Young Lords opposed machismo because as member Gloria Gonzlez articulated in her 1971 Palante editorial it serves to divide members of their movement Further the organization believed machismo serves as an extension of capitalism a system they opposed They understood the division of labor including both reproductive labor and productive labor to perpetuate the marginalization of women They also understood the sexual objectification of women to be problematic and damaging to potentially revolutionary leaders Moving toward this platform however would not have been possible without the Women of the Young Lords who pressured the organizations leadership to reject machismo during their East Coast Regional Central Committee retreat in May 1970 At this retreat the group studied and theorized formally denouncing machismo because if power was to be transferred to the people it would have to be the hands of all the people and if this were to be possible the Young Lords must reject attitudes of superiority that brothers had towards sisters and the passivity of sisters toward brothers allowing brothers to come out of a macho or chauvinist superior bag

Pilot House
Pilot also known as Everybody Lies is the first episode of the US television series House The episode premiered on the Fox network on November 16 2004 It introduces the character of Dr Gregory House played by Hugh Lauriea maverick antisocial doctorand his team of diagnosticians at the fictional PrincetonPlainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey The episode features Houses attempts to diagnose a kindergarten teacher after she collapses in class

House was created by David Shore who got the idea for the misanthropic title character from a doctors visit Initially producer Bryan Singer wanted an American to play House but British actor Hugh Lauries audition convinced him that a foreign actor could play the role Shore wrote House as a character with parallels to Sherlock Holmesboth are drug users blunt and close to being friendless The shows producers wanted House handicapped in some way and gave the character a damaged leg arising from an improper diagnosis

The episode received generally positive reviews the character of House was widely noted as a unique aspect of the episode and series though some reviewers believed that such a cruel character would not be tolerated in real life Other complaints with the episode included stereotyped supporting characters and an implausible premise The initial broadcast of Pilot was watched by approximately seven million viewers making it the 62ndmostwatched show of the week

Shortly after the start of class kindergarten teacher Rebecca Adler becomes dysphasic and experiences seizures Dr James Wilson attempts to convince Gregory House to treat Adler but House initially dismisses him believing that the case would be boring Hospital administrator Dr Lisa Cuddy approaches House in the elevator and attempts to persuade him to fulfill his duties at the hospitals walkin clinic House refuses claiming that Cuddy cannot fire him due to tenure and hurriedly leaves When Houses team attempts to perform an MRI on Adler they discover that Houses authorization for diagnostics has been revoked Cuddy restores his authorization in exchange for his working at the clinic

Adlers throat closes up during the MRI due to an allergic reaction to gadolinium prompting two members of Houses team Dr Robert Chase Jesse Spencer and Dr Allison Cameron Jennifer Morrison to perform a tracheotomy Working in the hospitals clinic Houses first patient is a man who is orange because of an overconsumption of carrots and megadose vitamins niacin House also treats a tenyearold boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed House criticizes the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma During his monologue House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis despite having no proof House treats Adler with steroids which improves her condition greatly for a time until she starts seizing and has heart failure

On Houses insistence neurologist Dr Eric Foreman and Cameron break into Adlers house to find anything that might account for Adlers symptoms They find an opened package of ham in Adlers kitchen and House concludes that she is suffering from cysticercosis from eating undercooked pork Adler refuses to accept more treatments unless there is evidence that the diagnosis is correct House is ready to dismiss the case when Chase provides an idea for noninvasive evidence of Adlers tapeworm infection by taking an Xray of her leg House proves that Adler is infested with tapeworms and her condition is treatable After seeing the evidence Adler agrees to take her medication to kill the tapeworms

Series creator David Shore traced the concept for House to his background as a patient at a teaching hospital Shore recalled that I knew as soon as I left the room they would be mocking me relentlessly for my cluelessness and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room In 2004 Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms The ideas behind Houses character were added after Fox bought the show Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctors visit he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctors appointment for a sore hip by which point his pain had disappeared Nevertheless Shore stated that the doctors were incredibly polite Shore later stated that as he wrote the pilot he fell in love with a character who as a doctor would actually ask Why am I wasting your time

A central part of the shows premise was that the main character would be handicapped The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair but Fox turned down this interpretation for which the crew was later grateful The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on Houses face which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane The original script called for House to be 34 years old however Shore later explained that he did not want the character to be that young

The episode was written by the series creator David Shore and was shot in Canada later episodes would be shot on soundstages in California Shore said that the writings of Berton Rouech a The New Yorker staff writer who chronicled intriguing medical cases inspired the plots for Pilot and other early episodes

Producer Bryan Singer originally demanded that an American actor play the role of House according to Singer the more foreign actors he watched audition for the part the more sure he was that an American was needed At the time of casting Hugh Laurie was filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix He put together an audition tape in a Namibian hotel bathroom the only place with enough light and apologized for its appearance which Singer compared to a bin Laden video Laurie improvised by using an umbrella for a cane Singer was impressed by Lauries performance and commented on how well the American actor grasped the character not realizing Laurie was British

Laurie initially believed that House was merely the sidekick of Wilson because the script referred to Wilson as a doctor with boyish looks Laurie did not realize that House was the protagonist until he read the full teleplay According to Shore its easy to make an asshole character unlikable Whats tricky is to make them watchable And Hugh came in and brought everything that
was there to the part the nastiness the not politically correct stuff And yet you wanted to watch him you wanted to spend time with him

Similarities between House and the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear in the pilot Shore explained that he was always a fan of Holmes and found the characters traits of indifference to his clients unique House and Holmes have only one real friend Wilson and Watson respectively who connects the cerebral hero to human concerns This Holmes and Watson dynamic was something the producers were looking for in the characters of House and Wilson especially in terms of chemistry

Robert Sean Leonard Dr James Wilson read the pilot scripts to Numb3rs and was planning to audition for the part but was drawn to auditioning for House because he enjoyed the role of being the guy the protagonist counts on as well as the similarities to Sherlock Holmes Leonard felt he did not audition well and thought his long friendship with Singer helped land him the role When asked in an interview why his character would ever be friends with House Leonard replied

Australian actor Jesse Spencers agent suggested that Spencer audition for the role of Chase but he was hesitant fearing the show might be similar to General Hospital Once the actor saw the scripts he changed his mind Spencer then persuaded the producers to change his character into an Australian Omar Epps who plays Foreman found influence from his work as a troubled intern on the TV show ER Epps and costar Jennifer Morrison read the scripts and believed that the show would be either a hit or miss

Houses premiere episode was generally well received Critics reacted positively to the character of House Tom Shales of The Washington Post called him the most electrifying character to hit television in years The New York Magazine called the series medical TV at its most satisfying and basic and stated that the cast consisted of nowikiprofessionalnowiki actors playing doctors who come to care about their patients while The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the episode did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers fears about HMO factories Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times said that though the characters might be a turnoff to some viewers the gore and derivative gall of the show were positives to fans of procedural dramas TV Guides Matt Roush stated House was an uncommon cure for the common medical drama Critics of The AV Club called House the nastiest black comedy from Fox since the 1996s shortlived television series Profit Critics considered the series to be a bright spot among Foxs otherwise reality televisionbased broadcast schedule

The episodes format was compared to a rival television series Medical Investigation USA Today favorably stated House as more characterdriven than Investigations plotdriven procedural and the San Francisco Chronicle felt that House was the better show due to the title character Varietys Brian Lowry meanwhile stated that the two shows were too similar and House was mismatched among Foxs other programs Other complaints included perceived stereotypes of young attractive doctors Sherwin Nuland of Slate gave the first episodes of the series a highly negative review stating that Of all the medical errata in this series and there are some whoppers the greatest is surely the conceit that a physician so remote so neglectful of duty so sadistic so downright cruel as Gregory House would be tolerated in any 
hospital Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Lauries portrayal of House humanized the character but also revealed the shows deepest flaw a reliance on shallow cuteness for comic relief Other complaints included a lack of characterization for the supporting characters in the first few episodes

The premiere attracted approximately seven million viewers in the United States making it the 62ndmostwatched show for the week of November 1521 2004 The United Kingdom terrestrial premiere was broadcast on June 9 2005 by Five and garnered a ten percent share 18 million viewers Christopher Hoag who composed the music for Pilot and the first season of House was nominated in the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Music Composition for the episode Shore received a Humanitas Prize nomination for writing the episode but lost out to John Wells who wrote the episode of The West Wing entitled NSF Thurmont

Ethical marketing
Ethical marketing refers to the application of marketing ethics into the marketing process Briefly marketing ethics refers to the philosophical examination from a moral standpoint of particular marketing issues that are matters of moral judgment Ethical marketing generally results in a more socially responsible and culturally sensitive business community The establishment of marketing ethics has the potential to benefit society as a whole both in the short and longterm Ethical marketing should be part of business ethics in the sense that marketing forms a significant part of any business model Study of Ethical marketing should be included in applied ethics and involves examination of whether or not an honest and factual representation of a product or service has been delivered in a framework of cultural and social values

It promotes qualitative benefits to its customers which other similar companies products or services fail to recognise The concern with ethical issues such as child labor working conditions relationships with third world countries and environmental problems has changed the attitude of the Western World towards a more socially responsible way of thinking This has influenced companies and their response is to market their products in a more socially responsible way

The increasing trend of fair trade is an example of the impact of ethical marketing In the Ethical Shoppers Price Index Survey 2009 fair trade was the most popular ethical badge products could have It also revealed that many consumers distrusted green claims The idea of fair trade is that consumers pay a guaranteed commodity price to a small group of producers the producers agree to pay fair labor prices and conserve the environment  a fair deal for everyone

The philosophy of marketing is not lost with this newfound ethical slant but rather hopes to win customer loyalty by reinforcing the positive values of the brand creating a strong citizen brand However this new way of thinking does create new challenges for the marketer of the 21st century in terms of invention and development of products to add longterm benefits without reducing the products desirable qualities

Many brands have tried to use ethics to make themselves look responsible often spinning environmental claims which has led to the term greenwash see greenwashing In research consumers have shown to have even less trust of ethical claims in ads than ordinary ads media attention on ethics has resulted in many top brands suffering consumer boycotts Although many brands have tried to use green issues it has been noted that in research 23 of consumers responded more to ethical claims that relate to people rather than to than environment

Ethical marketing should not be confused with government regulations brought into force to improve consumer welfare such as reducing sulfur dioxide emissions to improve the quality of the air A government regulation is a legal remedy intended to mitigate or correct an ethical issue such as pollution of the air that we all share Enlightened ethical marketing is at work when the company and marketer recognize further improvements for humankind unrelated to those enforced by governments or public opinion By way of example the Coop Group refuses to invest money in tobacco fur and any countries with oppressive regimes

Puerto Rican Volunteers Corps
The Puerto Rican Volunteers Corps Instituto de Voluntarios de Puerto Rico in Spanish was a militia composed of private citizens principally instituted for the defense of Puerto Ricos periphery from pirate incursions and foreign invasion In principle the volunteers were characterized by their unwavering loyalty to the Spanish Crown and Empire and as such were subject to compulsory membership in the Partido Incondicionalmente Espaol The Spanish Unconditional Party However upon its creation in 1812 the Partido Incondicional was exclusive to all but peninsularborn Spaniards peninsulares and it was only towards the second half of the century that its rolls were opened to insularborn subjects of European descent criollos

The Volunteer Corps did not fight as a group during the SpanishAmerican War of 1898 nor did the majority of its approx 8000 members assist the regular Spanish Army in its pro forma defense of the island The Corpss conduct during the war was not due to rank rebellion but rather to recalcitrance a low esprit de corps followed the Governor General of Puerto Ricos order to have all Volunteers integrated into the Regular Army without regard to any official rank or distinction they might have held in the Corps Volunteers by then consisting largely of the islands mercantile and hacendado elite eg Manuel Egozcue Cintrn Rafael Janer y Soler Francisco J Marxuach Pompeyo Oliu y Marxuach Narciso VallLlovera Feliu recoiled at the perceived injustice and indignity of having to fight alongside men recruited from the lowest rungs of Spanish colonial society Otherthough perhaps less quantifiablefactors contributing to Volunteer inaction were the signal winds of change sweeping over the remnants of Spains once vast imperial possessions the Cortess belated attempts at establishing an autonomist insular government in 1897 Spains bloody and ineffectual efforts at ending the Ten Years War and the USs undisguised expansionist aims combined with the contagion of assimilationist and insurrectionist groups operating from within the island and outwards from the US

Additionally by the time of the US invasion of the island on July 25 1898 the Voluntarios and indeed most everyone else in Puerto Rico was well aware that Spains land and naval forces had surrendered in Cuba and that Admiral Montijos fleet in the Philippines had been virtually destroyed Moreover it was quite evident that Spains regular army was not putting up much of a fight for Puerto Rico Accordingly the Voluntarios with few exceptions were not willing to risk injury or death in a war that was in effect lost New Yorks Seventh Volunteer Infantry Regiment also refused to enter the fray Reportedly they did not want to serve under regular army officers particularly those who had graduated from West Point

In 1898 they were up by a Commanding Officer and staff consists of a commander three captains two first lieutenants four deputies a doctor and a pharmacist His active force was formed by 14 infantry battalions and the company on the island of Vieques

KKHI defunct
KKHI was a classical music station in San Francisco California operating on both AM at 1550 kHz and FM at 957 MHz

KKHI relied heavily on local announcers playing recordings especially by Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra The station played primarily orchestral recordings and was known for avoiding chamber music Unlike its sister station in Los Angeles KFAC KKHI tended to play longer selections and never excerpts from symphonies or concertos The various daily programs each had a specific musical introduction one of the evening programs for example was introduced by the opening bars of the third movement of the second symphony of Sergei Rachmaninov One notable fact was KKHIs monthly playing of the Variations on a Theme by Tchaikovsky by Anton Arensky

The AM signal of KKHI began on March 17 1947 as KSMO in San Mateo California It was owned and operated by the Amphlett Printing Company the owner and publisher of the daily San Mateo Times The stations three directional transmitter towers were built in Belmont California next to the brandnew Bayshore Freeway US Highway 101 KSMOs programming was primarily classical recordings with some coverage of San Mateo High School athletic games

In 1952 Amphlett sold the station and it became known as KEAR The stations call letters were changed again in the mid1950s to KOBY and the station became a popular early outlet for Top 40 rock music Gordon McLendon bought the station in 1960 and changed its call letters to KQBY with a good music station format typically a classical hour 89 or 810 PM with smooth instrumentals show tunes etc outside those hours cf San Francisco Examiner San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco NewsCall Bulletin radio logs The station had been owned by Sherwood R Gordon He sold the station when a contract dispute with the union representing station engineers could not be resolved McLendon also owned KABL in Oakland with a format similar to KQBY

Finally in 1963 the station became KKHI and was joined with its FM counterpart within a year it switched back to classical music

KKHIFM which also began broadcasting in 1947 was first known as KGSF The Warner Brothers of Oakland owners of KWBR launched the station in San Francisco There were several ownership changes and call letter changes KXKX and KEARFM Fred Krock joined KXKX as an announcer in 1953 he would later become a major contributor at KKHI 
KKHI quickly arranged to broadcast many of the Friday evening concerts of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra usually when it was conducted by music director Josef Krips 19021974 in stereo from the War Memorial Opera House Since Krips refused to make recordings with the San Francisco orchestra the KKHI broadcasts were the only mass media outlet for the concerts The broadcasts continued in 1970 when Seiji Ozawa 1935 became the orchestras music director In the summer of 1973 when the orchestra toured Europe KKHI made history by broadcasting a Paris concert in stereo via satellite San Francisco Symphony broadcasts moved to KQEDFM in the early 1980s and were eventually nationally syndicated

Krock became chief engineer at KKHI in 1966 He was also the host for the afternoon commute programming and had major responsibilities for the San Francisco Symphony broadcasts His resonant voice became a fixture at the station Krock would eventually leave KKHI and become engineering supervisor at KQEDFM in 1980

By the late 1960s longtime KNBR disc jockey Doug Pledger had moved to KKHI hosting a longrunning Saturday afternoon program devoted to light classics Pledger was particularly fond of recordings by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra as well as selections from operettas For that matter KKHIs popular announcer Bill Agee hosted another longrunning weekend program called Gilbert  Sullivan  Me which showcased one of the operettas by the famous British duo complete with a running commentary on the storyline the program began with the opening strains of the overture to HMS Pinafore

Beginning in 1971 KKHI also broadcast Friday evening performances of the San Francisco Opera For a number of years actorwriter Scott Beach hosted these broadcasts which were offered in stereo with special encoding for those able to receive matrix quadraphonic signals Like the famed Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts also carried on KKHI there were regular intermission features including interviews with the conductors and singers in each opera These broadcasts continued until 1979

A regular feature on KKHI was a daily musical quiz program Telemusic Quiz hosted by Bill Agee Listeners would call in answers to the questions and if they had the right answer they would win tickets to various concerts Agee hosted the San Francisco Symphony broadcasts and made regular appearances at the summer concerts held in San Franciscos Stern Grove

The station operated 24 hours a day and its AM signal transmitted from Belmont California with 10000 watts of power could be received over much of the western United States and Canada at night The FM transmitter was located on San Bruno Mountain 

The KKHI call letters were later used by a Smooth Jazz Station in Denver Colorado from June 9 2008 to August 31 2010

Labor disputes along with declining advertising support eventually brought an end to the classical music programming The station was sold in 1994 to Westinghouse and its format was dramatically changed Now it was known as KPIXFM and AM The AMFM simulcasts ended in 1997 when Westinghouse sold KPIXFM to Bonneville International which changed the call letters to KZQZ The AM station is now known as KGMZ The FM station is now known as KGMZFM

The KKHI call letters were revived in 1994 on what had been KTIMFM and AM in San Rafael California The attempt to revive KKHIs classical music programming ultimately proved unsuccessful

The Bay Areas main classical music outlet today is KDFC in San Francisco California a station that broadcasts on FM only For many years there were daytime simulcasts on KIBE a 5000watt station on 1220 AM in Palo Alto California In the early 1960s the zenith of classical radio broadcasting in the Bay Area six stations broadcast this format KDFC 1021  KIBE 1220 simulcast KSFR 949 KKHI 957  1550 and KBRG 1053 cf Whites Radio Log and Radio Logs from SF newspapers named above

Electronics Illustrated was an American magazine started in May 1958 by Fawcett Publications the publishers of Mechanix Illustrated The magazine was published monthly from 1959 to 1961 then bimonthly until November 1972 Charles Tepfer was the first editor and Robert Beason was the editor for rest of the magazines run 1961 1972 The headquarters was in Greenwich Connecticut

ZiffDavis success with Popular Electronics magazine showed there was a market for electronics hobbyist magazines and the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 had increased the publics interest in science and technology Electronics Illustrated EI was targeted for this hobbyist and doityourself audience

The cover of the second issue had a rocket built in a basement workshop To promote amateur rocketry the US Army began a series titled Build a Safe Model Missile Model rockets appeared on the covers and in articles for several years The space race between the United States and the Soviet Union led many hobbyists into amateur rocketry In the late 1960s Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems MITS was formed to sell instrumentation to rocket hobbyist They were unsuccessful at that venture but later created the Altair 8800 computer kit that sparked the home computer revolution

The construction projects in Electronics Illustrated were assembled and checked by the editors The articles had numerous photos and always included a wiring diagram in addition to the schematic The projects were not as complex as those in other magazine but they appealed to the beginner The magazine also had introductory theory articles in every issue

Radio was another focus of the magazine with many articles on Citizens Band CB Amateur Radio and Short Wave Listening SWL

Robert Hertzberg began an amateur radio column The Ham Shack in April 1961 Hertzberg got his license in 1919 and had been writing about amateur radio ever since The column was taken over by Wayne Greene the publisher of 73 magazine as early as 1970

In the final years of magazine Tom Kneitel wrote a column in Electronics Illustrated that was similar to Tom McCahill column in Mechanix Illustrated
Fawcett discontinued Electronics Illustrated with the November 1972 issue and some of the content was continued in Mechanix Illustrated The circulation was 300000 but Fawcett claimed there was a shrinking market for electronics magazines and they wanted to focus on the larger Mechanix Illustrated audience of 15 million readers This followed ZiffDaviss merger of Electronics World with Popular Electronics in January 1972

Ryan Moore jockey
Ryan Lee Moore born 18 September 1983 is an English flat racing jockey who was Champion Jockey in 2006 2008 and 2009 He is currently the first choice jockey for Aidan OBriens Ballydoyle operation a role in which he mainly rides horses owned by Coolmore Stud He also sometimes rides horses for Juddmonte and The Queen

Moore is the son of successful trainer and former jump jockey Gary L Moore and brother to jump jockeys Jamie Moore and Joshua Moore and top amateur jockey Hayley Moore 

He is the grandson of trainer Charlie Moore a wellknown character who lived around the corner from Brighton Racecourse Charlie was also a secondhand car salesman and many stories have circulated about his dual career including how he swapped three truck tyres in exchange for a filly and how he started training when he accidentally bought a horse by raising his hand at auction He is also close to Garys sister his aunt Candy who is also a jockey

Ryan considers himself the laziest of the family

Moore starting riding at four having lessons at his grandads and with the pony club However he didnt enjoy cross country and showjumping finding it a bit tame when he wanted to be doing competitive racing instead National Hunt jockey AP McCoy rode for Moores father when in his teens and Moore aged 12 led him over hurdles as they schooled horses Moore was influenced by his drive and dedication He wanted to ride everything in the yard His work ethic was huge he told an interviewer

Unlike his siblings who knew from an early age that they wanted to race this wasnt always clear to Moore Football was another passion and he had trials with Brighton and Hove Albion

Moores first wins came as a 16yearold which is when he decided to take up racing as a career although his mother Jayne tried to persuade him to stay at school and complete his Alevels believing he wouldnt make it in racing At one point he too did not consider himself good enough During his Alevels he was taking days off to ride but this only lasted one term before he gave up 

Moore rode winners for his grandad before the latter died in 2000 I was close to him and won a couple of races before he died in 2000 I like to think it made him happy that it brought him something at the end of his life Im glad he saw it At 16 he weighed 8st 10lb but by the time he became champion apprentice he had to get down to 7st 13lb

Moores first mentor was Richard Hannon a trainer for whom he would still be winning big races when Hannon retired in 2013 He was sent to Hannon by his father At the end of his first full season he won the Cesarewitch Handicap and had Group race experience

His first major victory came for a different trainer though when he won the 2002 Cesarewitch Handicap for Martin Pipe on Miss Fara on 19 October 2002 He got his first black type victory later that same year when winning the Listed Jebel Ali Stakes in the United Arab Emirates shortly after Christmas 2002 He didnt score any major victories in 2003 and had a strike rate of under 10 but it was enough for him to become Champion Apprentice

2004 saw him top 100 winners and 1 million in prize money for the first time and on 29 August he won his first group race the Group 3 Prestige Stakes at Goodwood For Hannon he then won his first Group 2 race taking the Mill Reef Stakes on Galleota in September

Increasingly Moore rode for Sir Michael Stoute sharing those duties with Kerrin McEvoy Mick Kinane and others after Kieren Fallon quit as stable jockey to ride for Aidan OBrien It was for Stoute he had his first Group 1 win on Notnowcato in the Juddmonte International at York in August 2006 That year he won his first jockeys title which came as a surprise to him He had said that the odds of 81 on him becoming champion at the start of the season were too generous but he had expected to finish third Commentators were suggesting that his resilience and iron will should turn Moore into one of racings iconic figures 
In 2006 he was riding at 8st 5lb most days

In 2007 he rode Notnowcato to victory in the Tattersalls Gold Cup in Ireland and in the Eclipse For the latter race Moore took the horse down the stands side while the remainder of the field including oddson favourite and Derby winner Authorized and George Washington 

In that year Stoute horses gave him 47 of his 126 wins overtaking Hannon 33 winners as his primary stable Moore spent three months injured during the season preventing him from retaining his title but a late season crop of victories meant he still finished third in the jockeys table

These efforts were rewarded when he was offered the job as stable jockey at the end of the 2007 season while he was in Tokyo riding Papal Bull in the Japan Cup Hannon meanwhile would make more use of his soninlaw Richard Hughes jockey after his retainer with Khaled Abdullah came to an end Moore would later say of Stoute hes just a very clever man  an unbelievable brain
On the Thursday of Glorious Goodwood in 2007 Moore won four races including the Goodwood Cup on Allegretto

In April 2009 he rode winners at Sandown Park Sha Tin in Hong Kong and Windsor on consecutive days the 36 hour trip to the Far East winning him nearly 50000 after he won the Queen Elizabeth II Cup on Presvis trained by Luca Cumani That summer he won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on Conduit for Stoute The first three all trained by Stoute came together leading to a stewards inquiry but Conduit kept the result

Over the course of 2009 and 2010 he swept the big races of the world He won at the Breeders Cup in the autumn after sealing a third jockeys title Then he won the 2010 Derby on Workforce in a course record time and the Oaks on consecutive days He crowned the year with another win on Workforce in the Prix de lArc de Triomphe A broken wrist cost him another chance at the jockeys title but he was already being spoken of as an alltime great by some commentators Former jockey Willie Carson suggested he could be as good as Lester Piggott and predicted he would recapture the jockeys title in 2011
However his attention was beginning to shift from pursuing the title to concentrating on fewer bigger races instead He clarified that with a family he was no longer keen to travel the country in pursuit of another title The big races are becoming a massive draw for me Thats the way it has happened with a lot of top jockeys I understand why Frankie Dettori competes in fewer races Its understandable with our schedule His chances of winning the title took a blow in any case when he missed two months after injuring himself at Goodwood in July 

He was now riding for several celebrity owners He rode for many of the Manchester United team including Michael Owen Paul Scholes Ashley Cole and manager Alex Ferguson Moore also rode the Queens Carlton House to victory in the Dante Stakes at York Racecourse and then to a close 3rd in the Epsom Derby He finished 2011 by winning a Japanese Grade One on Snow Fairy for the second year running

OBrien was rumoured to be lining up Moore as stable jockey from November 2011 Moore had already won in big races for OBrien while retained by Stoute including at the Breeders Cup and Royal Ascot Stoutes stable had seen a downturn in fortunes while OBrien had provided Moore with big winners OBrien also had the antepost favourites for the next seasons Classics

Moore was keen on the job but reluctant to move his family from Newmarket to County Tipperary They negotiated a compromise that allowed Moore to live in England while riding for OBrien in Ireland at the major meetings

Instead OBriens son Joseph became the main rider for Ballydoyle Moore rode for OBrien when the trainer had multiple runners In that way he won the 2012 1000 Guineas on Homecoming Queen and the 2013 Derby on Ruler Of The World
He finished fourth in the jockeys championship of 2012 and runnerup in 2013 behind Richard Hughes
He again finished runnerup in the jockeys championship of 2014

By 2015 Joseph OBrien at nearly 6ft tall was struggling to make the weight to ride in the major races and his father Aidan needed a replacement In April it was confirmed that Moore would ride Ballydoyles runners in the Classics and other significant races OBrien explained the arrangement thus Ryan will be riding our main horses this year and Joseph will be riding other horses when the weights allow him to Seamie Heffernan and Colm ODonoghue will also be involved as in the past

By the end of the 2017 season Moore had won over 2000 races in Britain the third most of all active jockeys behind only Frankie Dettori and Joe Fanning both of whom had been riding for a decade longer

In the decades following the Breton War of Succession 134164 the defeated faction led by Olivier de Blois Count of Penthivre continued to plot against the Dukes of the House of Montfort The Blois faction which refused to relinquish its claim to rule over the Duchy of Brittany had taken Duke John VI prisoner in violation of the Treaty of Gurande 1365 The 16yearold Gilles took the side of the House of Montfort He was able to secure the Dukes release and was rewarded with generous land grants that were converted to monetary gifts

In 1425 Rais was introduced to the court of Charles VII at Saumur and learned courtly manners by studying the Dauphin At the battle for the Chteau du Lude he took prisoner the English captain Blackburn

From 1427 to 1435 Rais served as a commander in the Royal Army distinguishing himself for bravery on the battlefield during the renewal of the Hundred Years War In 1429 he fought alongside Joan of Arc in some of the campaigns waged against the English and their Burgundian allies He was present with Joan when the Siege of Orlans ended

On 17 July 1429 Rais was one of four lords chosen for the honor of bringing the Holy Ampulla from the Abbey of SaintRemy to NotreDame de Reims for the consecration of Charles VII as King of France On the same day he was officially created a Marshal of France

Following the Siege of Orlans Rais was granted the right to add a border of the royal arms the fleurdelys on an azure ground to his own The letters patent authorizing the display cited his high and commendable services the great perils and dangers he had confronted and many other brave feats

In May 1431 Joan of Arc was burned at the stake Rais was not present His grandfather died on 15November 1432 and in a public gesture to mark his displeasure with Rais reckless spending of a carefully amassed fortune left his sword and his breastplate to Rais younger brother Ren de La Suze

In 14345 Rais gradually withdrew from military and public life to pursue his own interests the construction of a splendid Chapel of the Holy Innocents where he officiated in robes of his own design and the production of a theatrical spectacle Le Mistre du Sige dOrlans The play consisted of more than 20000 lines of verse requiring 140 speaking parts and 500 extras Rais was almost bankrupt at the time of the production and began selling property as early as 1432 to support his extravagant lifestyle By March 1433 he had sold all his estates in Poitou except his wifes and all his property in Maine Only two castles in Anjou ChamptocsurLoire and Ingrandes remained in his possession Half the total sales and mortgages was spent on the production of his play It was first performed in Orlans on 8May 1435 Six hundred costumes were constructed worn once discarded and constructed afresh for subsequent performances Unlimited supplies of food and drink were made available to spectators at Raiss expense

In June 1435 family members gathered to put a curb on Rais They appealed to Pope Eugene IV to disavow the Chapel of the Holy Innocents he refused and carried their concerns to the king On 2July 1435 a royal edict was proclaimed in Orlans Tours Angers Pouzauges and ChamptocsurLoire denouncing Rais as a spendthrift and forbidding him to sell any more property No subject of Charles VII was allowed to enter into any contract with him and those in command of his castles were forbidden to dispose of them Raiss credit fell immediately and his creditors pressed upon him He borrowed heavily using his objets dart manuscripts books and clothing as security When he left Orlans in late August or early September 1435 the town was littered with precious objects he was forced to leave behind The edict did not apply to Brittany and the family was unable to persuade the Duchy of Brittany to enforce it

In 1438 according to testimony at his trial by the priest Eustache Blanchet and the cleric Franois Prelati Rais sent out Blanchet to seek individuals who knew alchemy and demon summoning Blanchet contacted Prelati in Florence and persuaded him to take service with his Master Having reviewed the magical books of Prelati and a traveling Breton Rais chose to initiate experiments the first in the lower hall of his castle at Tiffauges attempting to summon a demon named Barron Rais provided a contract with the demon for riches that Prelati was to give to the demon later

As no demon manifested after three tries the Marshal grew frustrated with the lack of results Prelati said Barron was angry and required the offering of parts of a child Rais provided these remnants in a glass vessel at a future evocation but to no avail and the occult experiments left him bitter and his wealth severely depleted

In his confession Rais said the first assaults on children occurred between spring 1432 and spring 1433 The first murders occurred at ChamptocsurLoire but no account of them survived Shortly after Rais moved to Machecoul where according to his confession he killed or ordered to be killed a large but uncertain number of children after he sodomized them

The first documented case of childsnatching and murder concerns a boy of 12 called Jeudon first name unknown an apprentice to the furrier Guillaume Hilairet Raiss cousins Gilles de Sill and Roger de Briqueville asked the furrier to lend them the boy to take a message to Machecoul and when Jeudon did not return the two noblemen told the inquiring furrier that they were ignorant of the boys whereabouts and suggested he had been carried off by thieves at Tiffauges to be made into a page At Raiss trial the events were attested to by Hillairet and his wife the boys father Jean Jeudon and five others from Machecoul

In his 1971 biography of Rais Jean Benedetti tells how the children who fell into Raiss hands were put to death

Raiss bodyservant tienne Corrillaut known as Poitou was an accomplice in many of the crimes and testified that his master stripped the child naked and hung him with ropes from a hook to prevent him from crying out then masturbated upon the childs belly or thighs If the victim was a boy he would touch his genitals particularly testicles and buttocks Taking the victim down Rais comforted the child and assured him he only wanted to play with him Rais then either killed the child himself or had the child killed by his cousin Gilles de Sill Poitou or another bodyservant called Henriet The victims were killed by decapitation cutting of their throats dismemberment or breaking of their necks with a stick A short thick doubleedged sword called a braquemard was kept at hand for the murders Poitou further testified that Rais sometimes abused the victims whether boys or girls before wounding them and at other times after the victim had been slashed in the throat or decapitated According to Poitou Rais disdained the victims sexual organs and took infinitely more pleasure in debauching himself in this manner than in using their natural orifice in the normal manner

In his own confession Gilles testified that when the said children were dead he kissed them and those who had the most handsome limbs and heads he held up to admire them and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed

Poitou testified that he and Henriet burned the bodies in the fireplace in Raiss room The clothes of the victim were placed into the fire piece by piece so they burned slowly and the smell was minimized The ashes were then thrown into the cesspit the moat or other hiding places The last recorded murder was of the son of onnet de Villeblanche and his wife Mace Poitou paid 20 sous to have a pages doublet made for the victim who was then assaulted murdered and incinerated in August 1440

On 15 May 1440 Rais kidnapped a cleric during a dispute at the Church of SainttiennedeMerMorte The act prompted an investigation by the Bishop of Nantes during which evidence of Raiss crimes was uncovered On 29 July the Bishop released his findings and he subsequently obtained the prosecutorial cooperation of Raiss former protector John VI Duke of Brittany Rais and his bodyservants Poitou and Henriet were arrested on 15 September 1440 following a secular investigation that corroborated the Bishops Raiss prosecution was likewise conducted by both secular and ecclesiastical courts on charges that included murder sodomy and heresy

The extensive witness testimony convinced the judges that there were adequate grounds to establish the guilt of the accused After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing Peasants of neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Raiss castle begging for food and never been seen again The transcript which included testimony by the parents of many of these children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Raiss accomplices was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst parts stricken from the record

The number of Raiss victims is not known as most of the bodies were burned or buried The number of murders is generally placed between 80 and 200 a few have conjectured that there were more than 600 The victims ranged in age from six to 18 and were predominantly boys

On 23 October 1440 the secular court heard the confessions of Poitou and Henriet and condemned them both to death followed by Raiss death sentence on 25 October Rais was allowed to make confession and his request to be buried in the church of the monastery of NotreDame des Carmes in Nantes was granted

Execution by hanging and burning was set for Wednesday 26 October At nine oclock Rais and his two accomplices processed to the place of execution on the Ile de Biesse Rais is said to have addressed the crowd with contrite piety and exhorted Henriet and Poitou to die bravely and think only of salvation His request to be the first to die had been granted the day before At eleven oclock the brush at the platform was set afire and Rais was hanged His body was cut down before being consumed by the flames and claimed by four ladies of high rank for burial Henriet and Poitou were executed in similar fashion but their bodies were reduced to ashes in the flames and then scattered

Although Gilles de Rais was convicted of murdering many children by his confessions and the detailed eyewitness accounts of his own confederates and victims parents doubts have persisted about the verdict Counterarguments are based on the theory that Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the Catholic Church or French state Doubts about Raiss guilt have long persisted because the Duke of Brittany who was given the authority to prosecute received all the titles to Raiss former lands after his conviction The Duke then divided the land among his own nobles Writers such as secretsocieties specialist  in his book Plaidoyer pour Gilles de Rais contend he was a victim of the Inquisition

In the early 20th century anthropologist Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley questioned the involvement of the ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case Crowley described Rais as in almost every respectthe male equivalent of Joan of Arc whose main crime was the pursuit of knowledge Murray who propagated the witchcult hypothesis speculated in her book The WitchCult in Western Europe that Rais was really a witch and an adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess Diana Most historians reject Murrays theory Norman Cohn argues that it is inconsistent with what is known of Raiss crimes and trial Historians do not regard Rais as a martyr to a preChristian religion other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity and whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures

Rais was retried during a media event in his home country of France without any official involvement of the public authorities and the judicial body In 1992 Freemason JeanYves GoauBrissonnire the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of France organized a selfproclaimed court consisting of former French ministers parliament members and UNESCO experts to reexamine the source material and evidence available at the medieval trial A team of lawyers writers and politicians led by Gilbert Prouteau and presided over by Judge Henri Juramy found him not guilty although none of the initiators was a medieval historian by profession In addition none of them sought professional advice from certified medievalists

The hearing which concluded Rais was not guilty of the crimes was partially turned into a fictionalized biography called Gilles de Rais ou la Gueule du loup narrated by the writer Gilbert Prouteau The case for Gilles de Raiss innocence is very strong Prouteau said No childs corpse was ever found at his castle at Tiffauges and he appears to have confessed to escape excommunication The accusations appear to be false charges made up by powerful rival lords to benefit from the confiscation of his lands The journalist Gilbert Philippe of the newspaper OuestFrance said that Prouteau was being facetious and provocative He also claimed that Prouteau thought the retrial was basically an absolute joke Historians continue to believe him guilty of the crimes mainly differing as to his motivation

Griffin
The griffin griffon or gryphon Greek  grphn or  grpn early form  grps  is a legendary creature with the body tail and back legs of a lion the head and wings of an eagle and sometimes an eagles talons as its front feet Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the beasts and the eagle the king of birds by the Middle Ages the griffin was thought to be an especially powerful and majestic creature Since classical antiquity Griffins were known for guarding treasure and priceless possessions 

In Greek and Roman texts griffins and Arimaspians were associated with gold deposits of Central Asia Indeed as Pliny the Elder wrote griffins were said to lay eggs in burrows on the ground and these nests contained gold nuggets 

In medieval heraldry the Griffin became a Christian symbol of divine power and a guardian of the divine

The derivation of this word remains uncertain It could be related to the Greek word  grypos meaning curved or hooked Also this could have been an Anatolian loan word compare Akkadian karbu winged creature and similar to Cherub A related Hebrew word is  kerv

Most statuary representations of griffins depict them with birdlike talons although in some older illustrations griffins have a lions forelimbs they generally have a lions hindquarters Its eagles head is conventionally given prominent ears these are sometimes described as the lions ears but are often elongated more like a horses and are sometimes feathered

Infrequently a griffin is portrayed without wings or a wingless eagleheaded lion is identified as a griffin In 15thcentury and later heraldry such a beast may be called an alce or a keythong

In heraldry a griffin always has forelegs like an eagles hindlegs A type of griffin with the four legs of a lion was distinguished by perhaps only one English herald of later heraldry as the Opinicus which also had a camellike neck and a short tail that almost resembles a camels tail

There is evidence of representations of griffins in Ancient Iranian and Ancient Egyptian art dating back to before 3000 BC In Egypt a griffin can be seen in a cosmetic palette from Hierakonpolis known as the Two Dog Palette which is dated to ca 33003100 BC

In Iranian mythology griffin is called Shirdal means LionEagle Shirdal have used in ancient art of Iran since late second millennium BC Shirdals appeared on cylinder seals from Susa as early as 3000 BC Shirdals also are common motifs in the art of Luristan North and North West region of Iran in Iron Age and Achaemenid art

Griffin depictions appear in the Levant Syria and Anatolia in the Middle Bronze Age dated at about 19501550 BC Early depictions of griffins in Ancient Greek art are found in the 15th century BC frescoes in the Throne Room of the Bronze Age Palace of Knossos as restored by Sir Arthur Evans It continued being a favored decorative theme in Archaic and Classical Greek art

In Central Asia the griffin appears about a thousand years after Bronze Age Crete in the 5th4th centuries BC probably originating from the Achaemenid Persian Empire The Achaemenids considered the griffin a protector from evil witchcraft and secret slander The modern generalist calls it the liongriffin as for example Robin Lane Fox in Alexander the Great 197331 and notes p506 who remarks a liongriffin attacking a stag in a pebble mosaic at Pella perhaps as an emblem of the kingdom of Macedon or a personal one of Alexanders successor Antipater

The Pisa Griffin is a large bronze sculpture that has been in Pisa in Italy since the Middle Ages though it is of Islamic origin It is the largest bronze medieval Islamic sculpture known at over three feet tall 425inches or 108 m and was probably created in the 11th century in AlAndaluz Islamic Spain From about 1100 it was placed on a column on the roof of Pisa Cathedral until replaced by a replica in 1832 the original is now in the Museo dell Opera del Duomo Cathedral Museum Pisa

Adrienne Mayor a classical folklorist and historian of science proposes that the ancient Greek idea and image of the griffin in classical art and literature beginning in the seventh century BC was influenced in part by the fossilized remains of beaked dinosaurs such as Protoceratops observed on the way to gold deposits by nomadic prospectors of ancient Scythia Central Asia This hypothesis is necessarily speculative based on a number of Greek and Latin literary sources and related artworks beginning with the first written ancient descriptions of griffins in a lost work by Aristeas of Proconnessus a Greek who traveled to the Altai region between Mongolia and NW China in the seventh century BC cited by Aeschylus and Herodotus ca 450 BC and ending with Aelian third century AD Mayors suggestion has been contested in a blog claiming that it ignores preMycenaean accounts and birdlion composites in earlier art that goes far earlier than 7th century BCE 

A multitude of imaginary composite creatures combining features of birds reptiles and mammals can be found in ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern art including mammals with bird heads in Minoan Mycenaeanand Egyptian art but there are no preMycenaean written accounts about Griffins and as Mayor has explained in fact no written accounts earlier than Herodotus in the fifth century BC survive to tell us anything about imaginary hybrid birdlion imagery in earlier cultures Mayors suggestion is necessarily speculative intended to account for the profusion of GrecoLatin literary accounts of the gryps Griffin as a real animal of the East and the accompanying popularity of artistic representations that arose in Greece after travelers like Aristeas brought back tales of Griffins from Central Asia

Several ancient mythological creatures are similar to the griffin These include the Lamassu an Assyrian protective deity often depicted with a bull or lions body eagles wings and humans head

Sumerian and Akkadian mythology feature the demon Anzu half man and half bird associated with the chief sky god Enlil This was a divine stormbird linked with the southern wind and the thunder clouds

In ancient Crete griffins became very popular and were portrayed in various media A similar creature is the Minoan Genius

In the Hindu religion Garuda is a large birdlike creature which serves as a
mount vahana of the Lord Vishnu It is also the name for the constellation Aquila

In medieval legend griffins not only mated for life but if either partner died then the other would continue the rest of its life alone never to search for a new mate The griffin was thus made an emblem of the Churchs opposition to remarriage Being a union of an aerial bird and a terrestrial beast it was seen in Christendom to be a symbol of Jesus who was both human and divine As such it can be found sculpted on some churches

According to Stephen Friars New Dictionary of Heraldry a griffins claw was believed to have medicinal properties and one of its feathers could restore sight to the blind Goblets fashioned from griffin claws actually antelope horns and griffin eggs actually ostrich eggs were highly prized in medieval European courts

When Genoa emerged as a major seafaring power in the Middle Ages and Renaissance griffins commenced to be depicted as part of the republics coat of arms rearing at the sides of the shield bearing the Cross of St George

By the 12th century the appearance of the griffin was substantially fixed All its bodily members are like a lions but its wings and mask are like an eagles It is not yet clear if its forelimbs are those of an eagle or of a lion Although the description implies the latter the accompanying illustration is ambiguous It was left to the heralds to clarify that

A hippogriff is a legendary creature supposedly the offspring of a griffin and a mare

In heraldry the griffins amalgamation of lion and eagle gains in courage and boldness and it is always drawn to powerful fierce monsters It is used to denote strength and military courage and leadership Griffins are portrayed with the rear body of a lion an eagles head with erect ears a feathered breast and the forelegs of an eagle including claws These features indicate a combination of intelligence and strength

In British heraldry a male griffin is shown without wings its body covered in tufts of formidable spikes with a short tusk emerging from the forehead as for a unicorn The female griffin with wings is more commonly used

In architectural decoration the griffin is usually represented as a fourfooted beast with wings and the head of an eagle with horns or with the head and beak of an eagle

A theory postulated by Adrienne Mayor is that the griffin of classical Greek literature and art was influenced by observations and accounts brought back to the Mediterranean region by traders and travelers along the Silk Road from the Turfan Basin and western reaches of the Gobi Desert where fully articulated white fossils of Protoceratops beaked dinosaurs continually weather out against reddish ground Such fossils seen by ancient observers may have been interpreted as evidence of a halfbirdhalfmammal creature  Over repeated retelling and drawing recopying its bony neck frill which is rather fragile and may have been frequently broken or entirely weathered away may become large mammaltype external ears and its beak may be treated as evidence of partbird nature and lead to birdtype wings being added

Paleontologist Mark Witton has contested this hypothesis believing that it relies on ignorance of preGreek griffin accounts and art which have occurred considerably before the Central Asian trade scenario But no preGreek griffin written accounts exist to tell us what was believed about imaginary hybrid birdmammal and other composite figures from the preclassical time period Mayors hypothesis suggests that unfamiliar fossils exhibiting bird and mammal featuresbeaks four legs and eggs in nests can help explain the belief recorded in numerous Greek and Roman sources from Herodotus and Aeschylus to Pliny Pausanias and Aelian that Griffins were real animals observed in the deserts along the Silk Route and might also help account for the proliferation of reports and illustrations of Griffins that began after the seventh century BC

Red Ingle
Ernest Jansen Red Ingle 7 November 1906  6 September 1965 was an American musician singer and songwriter arranger cartoonist and caricaturist He is best known for his comedy records with Spike Jones and his own Natural Seven sides for Capitol

Ingle was born in Toledo Ohio on 7 November 1906 He was taught basic violin from age five by Fritz Kreisler a family friend However at 13 he took up the saxophone and that instrument later became his main instrument Ingle received a music scholarship and studied at the Toledo American College of Music playing classical music on a concert level Ingle was also influenced by the country fiddlers he had heard he was able to play their songs in their style as well as the classics in a traditional pose At 15 he was playing professionally with Al Amato and by his late teens Ingle was touring steadily with the Jean Goldkette Orchestra along with future jazz legends Bix Beiderbecke and Frankie Trumbauer A graduate of Toledos Scott High School at one time he intended to become a teacher Ingle left the College of Music in 1926 to become a fulltime musician when he married Edwina Alice Smith He joined Ted Weems Orchestra in 1931 after briefly being a bandleader himself and working under Maurice Sherman His work with Weems was such a success that they worked together into the 1940s Singer Perry Como later called Ingle one of the most talented men Ive ever met

A pilot since 1924 Ingle wrote the Army Air Forces Ive Got Wings manual as part of his wartime work at the Civil Aeronautics Administration A talented leather carver whose saddles were in demand by celebrities he also taught the skill in Veterans hospitals during this time One of Ingles carved saddles was on exhibit at the Golden Gate International Exposition Worlds fair in San Francisco in 1939 a saddle carved with images illustrating the history of the state of California

Ingles son Don followed his father into the music business in 1949

After he failed an eye test for the Air Force he returned to music with Spike Jones  His City Slickers where his comedic talents and flair for vocal effects found a welcoming home Jones started featuring him as a frontman immediately and Ingles stage presence helped transform the City Slickers stage act into something more visual than before

With Ingles input the band gradually became a complete stage package that would eventually peak after his departure in 1946 in the late 1940s and early 1950s with the successful Musical Depreciation Revue

There was nobody in the band as funny as Red said Zep Meissner the bands clarinetist guys like him were funny in themselves they didnt need material

An example of his routine appears in the film Bring on the Girls where he takes off the vaudeville song Chloe He would run on in a frightwig combat boots and a nightgown while waving a lantern climaxing the song with the cry I gotta go as he dived into an outhouse A record of this song went gold for the band spending four weeks in the top ten He was also the featured vocalist on other City Slickers hits such as You Always Hurt the One You Love Liebestraum and Glow Worm  this last being featured in the film Breakfast in Hollywood one of many films featuring the band

Ingle left Jones and the City Slickers in November 1946 after a salary dispute He drifted through Radio and Hollywood even working in light opera until he made TimTayShun a spoof recording of the thenpopular Perry Como hit Temptation with Jo Stafford under the name Cinderella G Stump for Capitol Records in 1947 As the single went on to sell three million copies Ingle formed a new band  Red Ingle and His Natural Seven the group included several former City Slickers among them Country Washburn who had arranged TimTayShun The band had several more hits including Cigareetes Whuskey and Wild Wild Women Them Durn Fool Things and A Youre a Dopey Gal Cigareetes became a hit because it was banned from radio airplay by all major networks

After TimTayShuns success Ingle had a followup in mind a takeoff on the classical works of Paganini but doing this required a violinist who was trained in classical music Knowing that any direct requests for a classical performer would be refused Ingle dreamed up his own classical ensemble Ernest Ingles Miniature Symphony A concert violinist responded and was quickly signed to a recording contract for the intended record When the musician was shown the arrangement he was to play he protested and attempted to leave without performing Ingle and his band quickly reminded the violinist of the legality of the contract he had just signed A deal was struck to get Pagan Ninnys Keep Er Going Stomp recorded the concert performer was allowed to use a pseudonym on the record

Ingle and his Natural Seven also performed with Grand Ole Opry performers such as Minnie Pearl and other Opry notables He joined Jo Stafford on her 1949 tour of the Midwest Despite the comedy emphasis the quality of the musicianship was often outstanding including in some cases Les Paul or Western Swing performers Tex Williams and steel guitarist Noel Boggs The band also recorded short films of their numbers before disbanding in 1952 by 1956 Ingle had formed the band once again

After working again with Weems Ingle eased out of music tiring of touring He reunited with Jo Stafford in 1960 for a performance of TimTayShun on Startime by this time he had lost a great deal of weight and was barely recognizable as the former leader of the Natural Seven He also had a reunion with Perry Como band leader Ted Weems and former fellow band members Ingle Elmo Tanner Parker Gibbs and Country Washburn appeared as guests on Comos Kraft Music Hall on 18 October 1961 There was one last reunion with Spike Jones an album called Persuasive Concussion satirizing the thenpopular Persuasive Percussion albums It was never completed Jones died in 1965 Ingle also died the same year of an internal hemorrhage Excerpts from Persuasive Concussion featuring Ingle were issued on LP in the 1970s The Very Best of Spike Jones on the United Artists label

Ingle said he had been trying to retire from the music business since 1942 he signed up with Spike Jones a year later and that his leaving the band in 1946 was another try at retirement By 1948 he described himself as being resigned to staying in the field

Ingle died September 6 1965 in Santa Barbara California and was buried in Ovid Michigan

History of Iberia airline
Iberia Lneas Areas de Espaa SA Iberia Airlines of Spain in English usually shortened to Iberia is the largest airline of Spain based in Madrid

The years following World War I saw a large advancement in aircraft technology with concomitant increase in possibilities for rapid connections between international business concerns Germany had many business concerns particularly in Africa and South America but was still reliant on ships and land routes to reach these In order to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles stipulation that prohibited German aircraft access to flying over France agents in Spain explored the possibility an air liaison between Germany and Spain As such Deutsche Luft Hansa on behalf of German government established a general agreement with the Spanish government which was signed on December 9 1927 authorizing an air service between both countries

Iberia Compaa Area de Transportes was incorporated on June 28 1927 with an initial capital investment by the financier Horacio Echeberrieta and Deutsche Luft Hansa of 11million pesetas The company obtained Government authorisation to establish commercial daily except Sunday connections between Madrid and Barcelona A fleet of three Rohrbach Roland monoplanes were bought in from Deutsche Luft Hansa

Flight operations started on December 14 1927 with inaugural flights aimed to coincide at a commemorative show in Madrid The opening ceremony at Carabanchel aerodrome was attended by Alfonso XIII and the president of Iberia Horacio Echeberrieta The maiden flight from Madrid left on schedule taking off from Madrid at 1230 and arriving in Barcelona 3 hours later However the Barcelona to Madrid flight was briefly forced to stop in Almazn Soria due to reduced visibility caused by snow Although this flight had set off at 900 aiming to arrive in Madrid at midday the delay meant it arrived in Madrid two hours after the dignitaries had already leftWithin a year the company was sponsored by the government to provide postal transport between Madrid and Barcelona Meanwhile Deutsche Luft Hansa was favourably rewarded for the 24 investment in the Iberia company when it was granted the regular service between Germany and Spain On January 5 1928 the route Barcelona  Marseilles  Geneva  Zrich  Stuttgart  LeipzigHalle  Erfurt  Berlin was initiated In July 1928 a twinengined Dornier Wal was added to the fleet This seaplane was used on a pioneering route between Cdiz and the Canary Islands This was used to test the viability of a postal route to South America by extending the route via Cape Verde Islands

During the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera it was proposed that the aviation companies in Spain should be combined and become statecontrolled as a general interest public utility This came into effect in early 1928 As a consequence Iberia was merged into Compaa de Lneas Areas Subvencionadas SA CLASSA together with the following other airlines Unin Area Espaola UAE Compaa Espaola de Trfico Areo CETA the pilot training company Compaa Espaola de Aviacin CEA and the airship line Transarea Coln

Although Iberia ceased activities on 29 May 1929 barely eighteen months after having begun operations the name Iberia continued to be registered by DirectorGeneral Daniel de Araoz y Arjula Of all the airlines that formed CLASSA Iberia would be the only one to keep in existence after the merger

Following the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 the LAPE Lneas Areas Postales Espaolas company the airline that would replace CLASSA became established LAPE began operations in April 1932 CLASSA flying under the Spanish Republican Flag for one year

LAPE operated even during the Spanish Civil War mainly in its Madrid  Barcelona line although a great part of the planes of its fleet were requisitioned by the Spanish Republican Air Force and used as military transports

As the name Iberia was still registered it was used anew when airline operations began in 1937 in territory held by the rebel faction during the Spanish Civil War In 1939 after the end of the conflict the planes belonging to LAPEs fleet were repainted with the Iberia airline livery

When the Iberia company fully restarted operations following the Civil War it became a purely domestic airline It won the right to many of the international routes such as the service between Madrid and Lisbon which had been previously established in early 1927 by Unin Area Espaola UAE 

One eighth of the new Iberias capital investment was offered to Ala Littoria fascist Italys airline After some deliberation due to its negative experience in investing in the related Corporacion Sud Americana dos Servicios Areos Ala Littoria decided to invest capital in Iberia in the form of two aircraft which were to join Iberias fleet The new Iberias shares were held by the Spanish government 51 and private investors 49 Foreign interests could only own up to a maximum of 50 of the 49 of Iberia shares allocated to foreign investment Ala Littoria purchased three Ju 52 airframes without engines from Lufthansa and gave them to Iberia in lieu of capital The aircraft were put to work initially on the RomeVeniceMunichBerlin route

The company still had close ties with Lufthansa which during World War II caused considerable difficulties to maintain the fleet as the import of fuel and spare parts was infrequent In addition the Allied Powers refused cooperation with the company until connections with Nazi Germany were severed

The airline was nationalised on September 30 1944 becoming part of INI In 1946 using the Douglas DC4 on the Madrid to Montevideo and Buenos Aires route it became the first airline to fly between Europe and South America after WWII The lucrative market to South America was helped by the families separated by the Civil War However there was intense competition from Air France KLM and British South American Airways Since the company was struggling to meet domestic demand the Government allowed another company Aviaco to operate the domestic routes that Iberia did not use from February 18 1948

By the Pact of Madrid in 1953 visa requirements were eliminated for US visitors to Spain This stimulated the commencement of transatlantic flights between Spain and United States the following year In addition the amendments made in Montreal to the Convention on International Civil Aviation on June 14 1954 were liberal to Spain allowing impetus for mass tourism using charter planes Iberia responded to the increased traffic by acquiring a fleet of Lockheed Super Constellation long range aircraft and these served the routes to North and South America from 1954 The pressurised twinengined Convair 440 was introduced to the companys European routes from 1957

From 1961 Iberia had a fleet of Douglas DC8 fourengined long range jet airliners The busiest route was Madrid to Buenos Aires By 1965 a joint board of Iberia and Aviaco was set up to coordinate policies so that services did not conflict In the early 1970s the company bought Douglas DC9s and Boeing 747s as it expanded routes to Central America Warsaw Athens and Istanbul

In 1974 it launched Europes first walkon shuttle service linking Madrid and Barcelona That year it established the Serviberia telephone information service the precursor of todays popular call centres as well as the Red Jackets uniformed ground staff with the mission of providing special service to customers and to resolve any problems that might arise

By the 50th anniversary in 1977 the airline carried over 10 million passengers in a year for the first time There was fierce internal and political debates over the use of Douglas DC9s or Boeing 727s with the result that Iberia bought Boeing 727s thereby boosting Boeings flagging production line However this financial commitment and subsequent failure to anticipate predicted passenger numbers caused heavy losses for the company during the 1980s This was especially disappointing in 1982 with the visit of Pope and the football World Cup By 1987 routes to Tel Aviv Khartoum Moscow and Tokyo were added

In the late 1980searly 1990s Iberia planned a fleet renewal with the McDonnell Douglas MD87 Airbus A320 and Airbus A340 replacing the Douglas DC9 Boeing 727 and Douglas DC10 respectively A number of Boeing 757s were also bought

At this time Iberia began to build up interests in other Spanish airlines  Aviaco Viva Air Binter Canarias and Binter Mediterrneo  and Latin American airlines Aerolneas Argentinas Viasa and Ladeco In June 1990 the company led a consortium to buy Aerolneas Argentinas for an agreed 2billion for 85 stake and the following year bought 45 stake in Viasa for 145million

In 1991 Iberia set up Europes first international airline frequentflyer programme Iberia Plus and in 1996 the airline launched the wwwiberiacom website The company ordered 76 aircraft from Airbus in February 1998 which was largest single consignment of Airbus ordered and bought Aviaco in 1999 and inherited its fleet This was the start of Iberias shift from a BoeingMcDonnell Douglas fleet to an Airbus fleet

By this stage privatisation calls from European Union and Spanish Government were being implemented In December 1999 the company became semiprivatised with shares distributed 40 shareholders 9 British Airways for 245million and 1 American Airlines An initial public offering on October 2000 failed to go ahead due to internal business difficulties most notably the failure to offload stock in Aerolneas Argentinas

Iberia is an international transportation group operating in about 100 airports in 40 countries employing more than 26000 people

In 2002 Iberia celebrated its 75th anniversary making it one of the oldest airlines in the world During those 75 years nearly 500million people have been flown by Iberia placing the company among the five largest European airlines and important for routes connecting Spain with Europe and Latin America

The Iberia Group encompasses the Iberia RegionalAir Nostrum franchise In addition to transporting passengers and freight Iberia carries out many related activities such as aircraft maintenance handling in airports IT systems inflight catering and holiday packages

Iberia Group airlines fly to 97 destinations in 40 countries Via codesharing arrangements with other companies it offers flights to another 60 destinations in 25 countries With a fleet of almost 200 aircraft it makes about 1000 flights each day In 2002 Iberia carried 28million passengers and 210000 tons of freight

In addition Iberia is an aircraft maintenance company servicing its own fleet and those of another 48 companies including some European airlines Iberia is the main supplier of aircraft handling services at all Spanish airports with more than 200 airline clients

Iberia was a founding partner in the computerised air ticket reservation system Amadeus CRS with an 1828 stake  this was sold in 2005 It is also a tour operator through its Viva Tours and Tiempo Libre units and with Cacesa it supplies package delivery services

Iberia is allied with American Airlines and British Airways and on September 1 1999 joined the Oneworld alliance British Airways owns 9 of its share capital

In July 2004 Iberia announced it had decided to move its Latin American hub from Miami Florida to San Pedro Sula Honduras Although rumoured plans that the airline was considering to set the hub at Luis Muoz Marn International Airport were discarded with the announcement Iberia announced that it plans to expand its Puerto Rican schedules to connect San Juan with Central American cities
In 2005 Iberia introduced its new Business Plus Class on its Airbus A340 aircraft

On February 5 2006 the new Terminal 4 at Madrid Barajas was awarded to Iberia and the Oneworld alliance members This provided expansion capabilities for Iberia Iberia alone is responsible for around 60 of Madrid Barajas traffic In 2005 Iberia and its regional branch Air Nostrum transported 21619041 passengers tofrom Madrid Barajas alone

Iberia partially owns a lowcost carrier called Clickair launched in November 2006

On November 12 2009 Iberia Airlines confirmed that it had reached a preliminary agreement to merge with British Airways The merger between the two carriers will create the worlds thirdlargest airline in terms of revenue On April 25 2010 it was confirmed that British Airways and Iberia had agreed to a merger forming the International Airlines Group although each airline would continue to operate under its current brand International Airlines Group established its head office in London and its registered office in Madrid operating mainly from its two main hubs of London Heathrow Airport and Madrid Barajas Airport with secondary hubs at London Gatwick Airport and Barcelona El Prat Airport

History of Sioux City Iowa
Iowa is in the tallgrass prairie of the North American Great Plains historically inhabited by speakers of Siouan languages
The area of Sioux City Iowa was inhabited by Yankton Sioux when it was first reached by Spanish and French furtrappers in the 18th century 
In 1803 during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson France sold a vast portion of central North America to the United States of America This Louisiana Purchase was largely unexplored Jefferson sent out the Corps of Discovery under Lewis and Clark to scientifically document the territory In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition traveled up the Missouri and setup camp near what would become Sioux City Iowa On August 20 a member of the expedition Sgt Charles Floyd died of bilous colic and was buried on a bluff overlooking the river At the time of Lewis and Clark the Omaha tribe of Native Americans were present just downstream from this region and the Yankton Sioux were upstream William Thompson established a trading post near Floyds Bluff in 1848 and had early ambitions for founding a city However Thompsons hopes were never realized settlers further upriver between the Floyd and Big Sioux rivers met with more success

Theophile Bruguier a FrenchCanadian fur trader is considered the first white settler on land that would become Sioux City According to one legend he told his friend Chief War Eagle of the Yankton Sioux about a dream he had regarding a rich land where two rivers joined near a high bluff War Eagle told him that he knew of this land near the mouth of the Big Sioux River In reality Bruguier had already passed this place many times in his voyages between Fort Pierre in the Dakota Territory and St Louis Missouri as an agent for the American Fur Company In 1849 Bruguier established his farm on this same land this farm included log cabins and tipis used by the family of War Eagle Bruguier claimed all the land from the mouth of the Big Sioux River east along the Missouri River to near the Floyd River In 1852 he sold the land from Perry Creek east to the Floyd River to Joseph Leonais At about that time Bruguier encouraged James A Jackson a fur trade outfitter from Council Bluffs then Kanesville to come upriver to establish a trading post Jackson in turn convinced his fatherinlaw Dr John K Cook of the areas potential as a future city Cook an Englishborn Oxford Universityeducated physician turned frontier surveyor was most impressed by the location at the mouths of the Big Sioux and Floyd Rivers at the Missouri In his official capacity as United States Federal Government surveyor Dr Cook established the little town of Sioux City in 1854 staking out its lots and streets Joseph Leonais who owned much of the land which would become the downtown area sold it to Dr Cook after much haggling for 3000 Within 3 years the new town had a population of 400 people and incorporated as a city

The first steamboat arrived from St Louis in June 1856 loaded with readyframed houses and provisions

The railroad first arrived in 1868 About that time a few small factories opened In 1873 James Booge opened the first largescale meatpacking plant and created a demand which ultimately led to the opening of the livestock yards stockyards in 1884 The period from about 1880 to 1890 marked the most rapid and significant progress made thus far in Sioux Citys development In 1880 Sioux City had a population of 7500 in 1884 15514 in 1886 22358 in 1887 30842 and in 1890 38700 Street cars water works electric lights and other improvements appeared Factories jobbing houses meatpacking plants retail stores and railroads increasingly came on the scene The citys building boom included an elevated railroad the Sioux City Elevated Railway and early skyscrapers These changes mirrored growth that was occurring nationwide especially in the transition of small pioneer settlements to thriving urban centers President Grover Cleveland visited in 1887 by then Fourth Street was the center of the business district

Sioux City is also the birthplace of the Corn Palace a temporary building made each year as part of the Corn Festival The Sioux City Corn Palaces were large wooden buildings with corn cobs nailed to their walls The first Corn Palace was built in 1887 and was designed by architect WE Loft The Corn Palace became larger and grander every year The last Sioux City Corn Palace built in 1891 sprawled across the citys downtown area The palace had three towers one of which stretched 200 feet tall It also had a large tunnel which allowed traffic to pass right beneath its center
But bad weather brought a poor turnout for the 1891 Corn Festival as the building was unheated The Great Floyd River Flood of 1892 drowned any further hopes for the festival and Corn Palaces were never built in Sioux City again

In May 1892 heavy rains caused the Floyd River to rise sending a destructive wave of muddy water through the unprepared city At least three thousand people were left homeless The stockyards and railroad lines were all badly damaged and a lumber yard caught fire The final death toll from drowning was twentyfive according to the Army Corps of Engineers

The nationwide Financial Panic of 1893 resulted in number of real estate investors and entrepreneurs in Sioux City losing great paper fortunes Edwin Peters the developer and promoter of Morningside claimed to have lost 15 million only to be left with a debt of 7000

In 1898 all units of the Iowa National Guardthe 49th 50th 51st and 52nd Infantry Regiments as well as artillery and cavalry unitswere called to active duty in the War with Spain The 49th and 50th entrained for South Florida but did not reach Cuba The 51st was sent to the Philippines and engaged in combat action there The 52nd remained stateside

In 1900 on a high bluff overlooking the Missouri River construction began on the 100 tall Floyd Monument a stone obelisk honoring the burial site of Sgt Charles Floyd Floyd died near here while exploring the region with the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1804 The monument which was completed in 1901 was later recognized by the US Department of Interior as the First National Historic Landmark in 1960

In 1900 Sioux Cityans and the rest of the country were the victims of a fraud perpetrated by former Sioux City land speculator developer and later notorious wheelerdealer John Peirce Peirce was a colorful and flamboyant character a decorated Union Army veteran wounded in the Civil War and a major promoter during Sioux Citys 19th Century boom years Until fairly recently Sioux City historians and civic promoters held Peirce in high esteem for his years of seeming dedication to the growth of Sioux City especially of the North Side More recent investigation has shown that in the end Peirce was a very clever scoundrel who actually got away with his crime Like most other businessman Peirce had been hurt very badly by the financial panic of 1893 While most of Sioux Citys leading businessmen honorably spent years working and rebuilding to pay back their debts Peirce began scheming for a way to bilk the public out of the funds he needed to effect his relocation to the west coast In 1900 he initiated a nationwide lottery to dispose of his northside mansion which later became the Sioux City Museum About 40000 tickets were sold at one dollar each The drawing took place at the Union passenger depot on Christmas Eve of 1900 It was first announced that the winner was a jeweler from Vinton Iowa However a few days later it emerged that the winning ticket was actually held by a New York millionaire William Barbour Peirce had owed a hefty financial debt to Mr Barbour The abstract for the Peirce Mansion reveals that a warranty deed transferred title to Barbour nine days before the actual drawing and nineteen days before Barbour was publicly known to hold the winning lottery ticket Barbour promptly sold the mansion to William Gordon in exchange for bonds which were issued by the company operating the Combination Bridge Peirce a flamboyant figure to be sure wrote an emotional goodbye to Sioux City in the newspaper before heading west Peirce collected his money and disappeared from Sioux City forever

On December 23 1904 Sioux City suffered one of its greatest calamities when a fire broke out in the basement of the Pelletier Department Store on the southwest corner of Fourth and Jackson Streets The fire ignited when a store employee lit a match in a Christmas toy display area of the basement floor to ignite a gas jet to illuminate the display The head of the match flew off and landed in mounds of cotton that had been used to simulate snow drifts The room went up like a torch and the fire quickly spread throughout the multistory building The Sioux City Fire Department was neither manned nor equipped to suppress a rapidly spreading highrise fire whipped by wind gusts that quickly spread the flames to neighboring buildings Two and a half blocks of the downtown district were gutted by fire Only one person died in the catastrophe but the loss in property was in the millions of dollars Sioux City business investors lost little time in rebuilding the core business district

In the winter of 1914 the Industrial Workers of the World IWW chose Sioux City as the site of one of its many free speech fights The goal was to organize both industrial and agricultural farm laborers into one big union to pressure management for better wages and shorter hours Some community leadersnotably the enlightened Pastor and future Populist Republican Mayor Wallace Mertin Shortstrongly defended the rights of the workers to exercise free speech while not endorsing or condoning the radical and often violent tactics of the IWW As in all of the IWW free speech fights of that era once word of such a demonstration went out over the bush telegraph thousands upon thousands of unemployed men made their way into the city by foot or on freight cars The center of activity was in the 800 block of Fourth Street where Sioux City Police on horseback assisted by Iowa National Guardsmen engaged in skirmishing Hundreds of unemployed laborers were arrested until jails full city fathers bodily expelled them aboard freight cars which delivered them to isolated locations outside the city

When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917 Iowa had 3 National Guard regiments the 1st 2nd and 3rd The 3rd Iowa was federalized immediately as the new 168th Infantry Regiment and became part of the new 42nd Rainbow Division made up of guard troops from 26 states Organized and trained at Camp Mills New York the 42nd was the first American combat division to reach the front lines in France After extensive advanced combat training under supervision of French officers for a period of 90 days the 168th entered the front lines in February 1918 Many of the members of Company L were from Sioux City Northwest Iowa and Southeast South Dakota

Meanwhile Company L of the 2nd Iowa Infantry Regiment made up of National Guardsmen primarily from Council Bluffs Sioux City and other western Iowa communities was ordered to Camp Dodge Des Moines in May 1917 There the Company L men joined other companies of the 2nd Iowa drawn from across the state After getting organized and equipped at Camp Dodge from May through August the 2nd Iowa National Guard Regiment finally embarked by troop train for Camp Cody Deming New Mexicoone of 32 national army training cantonments

Arriving at Cody in September 1917 the 2nd Iowa was sworn into federal service and on 28 September the old 2nd Iowa became the 133rd Infantry Regiment of the newly created 34th Sandstorm Division The 34th remained in training at Camp Cody until late summer 1918 when it finally received orders to France After a full year living and training in primitive and duststorm conditions at this bleak desert outpost just 30 miles from the Mexican border most of the men of the 133rd Infantry were happy to be headed overseas and desirous of getting into the fight The division was held up at Ft Dix New Jersey for a couple of weeks due to the worldwide influenza pandemic but ultimately most of the combat units of the division arrived safely in England and from there moved onward to Le Mans France by October 1918 Upon arrival at Le Mans the War Department determined that the 34th Division would not be needed on the Western Front and the entire division was disestablished However most of the infantrymen were assigned to casual detachments and sent to other army units at the front as replacements

By this time the 168th Infantry which had arrived in France eight months earlier had spent 174 continuous days in combat and had suffered heavy casualties in repelling the German offensive of May 1918 and during the MeuseArgonne counteroffensive that summer Thus many men from the 133rd Infantry were sent as replacements to the 168th infantry and several of these were with the Rainbow Division in its final combat action of the warthe assault on Sedan 49 November 1918 Following the Armistice of 11 November these same Sioux City soldiers also were part of the 168th Infantrys watch on the Rhine being stationed at Niederzeissen Germany until 9 May 1919 Those men who had not returned from France immediately after the Armistice were finally shipped home from Germany arriving at Camp Dodge on the 18th of May The men received their discharges on 19 May 1919 and returned to Sioux City

In addition to the 133rd and 168th Infantry regiments made up of Iowa National Guardsmen hundreds more Sioux City men enlisted or were drafted into regular Army Marine Corps and Navy units during the war

In 1919 more than 1400 Sioux City veterans of the Great War gathered to form Monahan Post No 64 of the American Legion named in honor of Private Edward Monahan of Sioux City who had been the first man of the 168th Infantry Regiment killed in action in France Private Monahan in addition to giving his life had distinguished himself in combat having been mentioned in dispatches and also having been posthumously awarded the French Croix de Guerre Medal with Palm by the French government

In 1921 the city of Sioux City in partnership with civic and veterans groups designated a stretch of Stone Park Boulevard as the Memorial Mile by planting a tree to commemorate every Sioux City serviceman killed in the war to end all wars

A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale University and author of several scholarly books Congregationalist Minister Wallace Mertin Short was far and away the most educated individual ever to have held elected municipal office in Sioux City After crossing swords over the issue of temperance with the national elders of the Congregationalist Church and being officially defrocked as minister of that churchs Sioux City congregation Short rented a movie house on Fourth Street and founded a successful nondenominational church open to all He appealed to the downtrodden and dregs of society and enjoyed rubbing elbows in Sioux City taverns with common laborers The intellectual Short suffered from severe insomnia and made no secret of the fact that he personally consumed 1 large glass of beer every evening to help him sleep Such an admission from a man of the cloth was considered scandalous in the extreme in that time

Short nevertheless garnered sufficient backing from organized labor to win electoral office and he went on to serve three terms as Mayor from 1918 to 1923 Now using the Mayors office as his pulpit Short became a powerful spokesman for the rights of the working man and of the ethnic minorities who made up a significant percentage of Sioux Citys 70000 citizens in 1918 He embraced the Industrial Workers of the World and spoke publicly on their behalf when thousands of them congregated in the city to wage a free speech fight in 1914 While Shorts prounion sentiments and actions over his career resulted in an incorrect and unfair legacy of socialist Short was in fact a progressive Republican who possessed a deep sense of social justice and whose faith in the US Constitution and Bill of Rights frequently put him at odds not only with fellow clergymen but also with the large industrialists of the city At the same time Mayor Shorts sometimes naive faith in appointed members of his city administration resulted in several scandals for which he as chief executive must ultimately take the blame For example his friendship with local labor unions resulted in the appointment of an alcoholic union boss to head the citys Department of Public Safety during his first term When the Rush building collapsed in 1918 killing 39 citizens see below this Public Safety Commissioner arrived on the scene of the disaster in an inebriated condition and started handing out whiskey to the city firefighters and policemen on rescue duty This commissioner who had previously served as boss of the Sign Painters Union in Sioux City had virtually no experience in law enforcement or public safety and was eventually dismissed from his post and run out of town apparently by friends of Mayor Short

If ever an elected representative championed Sioux City as a working mans town it was Wallace M Short Even before taking elected office Short campaigned against the Temperance Movement and opposed Prohibition not on moral grounds but on the principal that alcohol consumption was a personal choice and not something to be controlled or governed from Des Moines or Washington DC Mayor Short remained a committed Republican for the remainder of his life and went on to hold office in the Iowa legislature until 1932 when the Democrats swept into office on the coat tails of Franklin Roosevelt Although neither history nor the people of Sioux City treated the remarkable Wallace Short fairly his administration of Sioux City during a decade of both turbulence and meteoric economic growth between 19181928 brought some of the best levelheaded government policies that the City of Sioux City ever hador will ever have Sadly not one street building or park has ever been named in Wallace M Shorts honorSee William H Cumberland Wallace Short Iowa Rebel Ames Iowa Iowa State University Press 1983 and Wallace M Short Let There Be LightKansas City The Hyde Park Press 1916 Martin Luther King Jr 1917

On June 29 1918 Sioux City suffered its greatest accidental loss of life when the fourstory Ruff Pharmaceutical building the Hedges Block at Fourth  Douglas Streets collapsed At the time of the disaster workmen were gutting the upper floors and preparing to lower part of the first floor to ground level Meanwhile retail activities had been allowed to continue at street level The building suddenly collapsed trapping scores of victims in the rubble Gas mains ruptured causing a massive fire that required 36 hours to contain In typical city government fashion of the day the City Public Safety Commissioner arrived on the scene and handed out bottles of whiskey to firemen and other rescuers Thirtynine people died in what became known as the Ruff Disaster

The population grew to 71227 at the 1920 census making Sioux City the 99th largest city in the United States In 1932 and 1933 a farmers strike occupied the city for some time preventing food shipments in protest of very low agricultural prices National Guardsmen of the 133rd Infantry based at Sioux City were called into service for 2 weeks by the Governor to patrol the strike at Cherokee Iowa

A major scandal erupted in Sioux City in 1935 two years after the Volstead Prohibition Act was repealed when it was discovered that corrupt Iowa state officialsincluding the Iowa State Attorney General and leaders of the Iowa State Alcohol Control Boardwere operating a profitable extortion scheme to offer protection to local Sioux City tavern owners in exchange for payoff money The Attorney General was arrested tried and convicted in the Woodbury County Courthouse It seems that the legalization of alcohol only provided corrupt state officials waiting in the wings an opportunity to profit from Sioux Citys profound love of alcoholic beveragescontrol over which had until recently been the sole domain of organized bootleggers

With war clouds on the horizon in Europe Companies L and M and the Howitzer Company 37mm antitank 133rd Iowa Infantry Regiment were called to active federal service in 1941 Upon mobilization the 133rd Infantry was made a part of the US 34th Red Bull Infantry Division which had been deactivated by the War Department in October 1918 The Iowa guardsmen had participated in allArmy maneuvers at Camp Claiborne Louisiana in 1940 and were among the first to be federalized Companies L M and the Howitzer Company all from Sioux City were among the first Americans sent to Europe when they landed in Londonderry Northern Ireland early in the war From Northern Ireland the unit sailed for the Mediterranean Theater where it saw its first combat in North Africa In the first major US offensive ground action against Germany in World War Two the 34th Division was ambushed and badly mauled by German Panzer and mechanized infantry units at Kasserine Pass Tunisia in 1943 The division suffered horrendous casualties including many POWs Later reconstituted the 34th saw subsequent combat in Italy

Early in World War II the US Army established a major training base at Sioux City located at Sergeant Bluff Iowa south of downtown New large runways were constructed to facilitate heavy bomber operations and the Sioux City Army Air Base became one of the prime locations for B17 heavy bomber basic flight qualification training as well as home to various support and maintenance units Hollywood actor and PilotCaptain later Colonel Jimmy Stewart was posted to Sioux City with his squadron in 1943 where he and his crew completed their initial B17 qualification prior to deployment overseas Just following the war in December 1946 the 185th Iowa Air National Guard unit was established at Sioux City

On December 14 1949 the large Swift  Company packing house located north of the Sioux City Stockyards and adjacent to the Floyd River channel suddenly exploded killing 21 Swift employees The cause of the disaster was never fully confirmed but the explosion was believed to have been caused by a leaking gas pipe

In 1950 Sioux City had a population of about 84000

On June 8 1953 the Floyd River again flooded when a torrential downpour in the Sheldon Iowa area sent a wall of water down into the lower valley Fourteen people lost their lives This flood was a major impetus for the Floyd River flood control project including the building of a straightened rocklined channel and high levee through the city The floodprone South Bottoms neighborhood was razed for this project in 1962

The 1970s witnessed a second decade of urban renewal in downtown Sioux City see the South Bottoms See Historic Fourth Street It took nearly another decade to rebuild the area Many buildings were torn down some dating back to the 1800s Although there was some criticism of redevelopment this was typical in many areas with urban renewal losing old and sometimes historic buildings

Labor unrest erupted yet again in Sioux City in the early 1970s with a series of strikes by union meatcutters laborers and allied trades against the Iowa Beef Processor IBP Dakota City Nebraska plant After years of fruitless negotiations management finally locked out union laborers erected a shanty town of cinderblock houses on the company compound and imported Mexican laborers This act and the concurrent departure of the Zenith TV manufacturing plant served as a wakeup call to the Woodbury County Labor Council which had wielded considerable political power in its defense of Sioux Citys primarily bluecollar citizenry for generations The streamlining of meat production processesas pioneered by IBP Corporationand the amalgamation of job tasks revolutionized the industry in a way that would have major repercussions for Sioux City Within 30 years the meatpacking industrythe industry that virtually built Sioux Citywould all but disappear within the boundaries of Sioux City and along with it the oncedominant Sioux City Stockyards Clean industries including manufacturing of computers would emerge to take its place This not only changed the culture and attitudes of city residents but demographics as well While this was a traumatic industrial transition most residents would agree that the changes have been very healthy for a city that was once blackballed by business developers as a tough strikeprone unskilled blue collar prolabor town This is not to denigrate the contributions of Labor which won many basic working rights for all Americans in several landmark strikes in Sioux City in the first half of the 20th Century But the influx of multinational corporations like IBP and the formation and rapid growth of Gateway Computer brought about corporate business philosophies and global outlooks that have clearly transformed Sioux City into a cleaner and less violent city

Battle Fantasia
The game is notable for its stylistic departure from many fighting games and is set in a fantasy world depicted as a storybook and borrows many superficial elements from roleplaying games including damage represented as numbers and a textheavy story mode which involves a number of heroes answering the call to battle to stop an evil force from once again attempting to destroy the world Battle Fantasia met with relatively low sales in Japan and received mixed to average reviews from critics

Battle Fantasia is a traditional versus fighting game where up to two players compete against each other in combat using a variety of characters each with their own special attacks and fighting styles While the game uses threedimensional graphics for characters they are restricted to a twodimensional battle area that only allows them to move back and forth or up into the air Players face each other in bestofthree round battles that involve the use of normal attacks throws and special moves that often involve combinations of button presses and directional input which can be strung together in long combo strings The game features four main attack buttons  two punches and two kicks  as well as a fifth Gachi  lit elegance or grace button used to parry incoming attacks If a player times a Gachi command just as an opponents attack lands it negates all damage and allows the player to counterattack in a brief time frame The button can also be used to push an opponent back when combined with a direction as well as allow the player to recover faster from a knockdown

As players deal and receive damage they add to their MP Gauge located at the bottom of the screen which can be stocked to a maximum of three levels Players can expend MP to activate Heat Up mode to increase their strength and add additional effects to their attacks with specific enhancements differing with each character The gauge also allows characters to unleash powerful super moves which cause heavy damage but require spending one gauge level to activate and can be strung together with special moves with proper timing resulting in a Super Cancel combination Matches are won either when a player depletes their opponents health bar or when the time limit of each round runs out resulting in a win for the player with the most remaining vitality The amount of health is different for each character and is represented by numerical hit points under each health bar


Battle Fantasia was developed by Arc System Works originally as a Japanese arcade game beginning in 2006 The company had previously been known for their work on the popular Guilty Gear fighting game series and was looking for ways to expand their market to a more general audience and appointed character illustrator Emiko Iwasaki as the projects director one of only a few women to rise to that position in the Japanese game industry The game was the companys first title developed for the Taito Type X arcade board hardware and was the first game to use Taitos Vewlix arcade cabinet which allowed the game to run in highdefinition 720p resolutions Although Iwasaki was given a large degree of freedom when making the game she was encouraged by the company to retain many features from the Guilty Gear franchise in order to maintain their core audience as well as being told that the game needed to use threedimensional graphics in order to develop the companys 3D talent as well as more efficiently utilize the Type X hardware Stylistically the game was a departure from Arc System Works earlier games with Battle Fantasias colorful fantasy art direction chosen due to the popularity of roleplaying games in Japan which was overseen by graphic designer Junya Motomura Gameplay was also made simpler when compared to other games in the genre in an attempt to bring more people into fighting games as well expand it to the female demographic Early beta versions of Battle Fantasia began public location tests in select arcades across Japan in October 2006 with further tests conducted over the next few months until the games official release in April 2007

A home console version of Battle Fantasia was announced in a February 2008 issue of Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine and was confirmed for release for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 systems The console releases would feature a number of new play modes including a new singleplayer story mode unique to each character and online play over Sonys PlayStation Network and Microsofts Xbox Live In order to make the game more competitive tweaks and balance changes were enacted to the games roster and exploits such as infinite combos were removed entirely On May 1 a playable demo version of the game was released for the Japanese PlayStation Network with a full commercial release for both consoles on May 29

In a July 2008 press panel Aksys Games announced that it would be bringing Battle Fantasia to North America the following September but only for the Xbox 360 When asked about the possibility of a PlayStation 3 version a representative remarked that Were looking into it but right now its just 360 In an interview with website Gamasutra when asked if a North American PlayStation 3 version was rejected by Sony Computer Entertainment America Arc System Works producer Kouki Sadamori merely replied that the question was a tough one to answer 505 Games signed on as the games European publisher who released both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions in the region simultaneously in March 2009 Battle Fantasias late release in the region was attributed to the subject of incest being discussed during certain characters Story Mode cutscenes which prompted the publisher to remove many alternative story paths from the game mode The game saw a very limited release in only a few selected countries and was originally indented to be a GBP25 budget title but rose to 40 after the game became exclusive to European game retailer GAME One year after the announcement that the game would only come to North America for the Xbox 360 Aksys Games announced that it would be releasing Battle Fantasia as a full download title on the PlayStation Network in Fall 2009 with project lead Frank deWindt stating that The fans have been asking for it and were here to deliver In addition to the announcement the company also held a contest on their official website for fans to name five new PlayStation Network achievement trophies added especially for the new release which was made available on Sonys PlayStation Store on December 22 2009

The home console versions of Battle Fantasia received relatively low sales in Japan with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions selling 3100 and 2300 copies respectively during their debut week Famitsu also gave both console versions 25 out of 40 while Famitsu Xbox360 gave the Xbox 360 version 29 out of 40

Western response to Battle Fantasia was mostly average with the game receiving mixed or average reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic Many critics compared the title to Arc System Works previous fighting game endeavor the Guilty Gear series with 1UPcom declaring that the game was more simplistic than the companys earlier works with less focus on technical aspects such as combos and that each characters special moves were flashy and not as situational The website felt that many of the changes resulted in the characters being more interesting and called the games fantasy art motif a pleasing sidestep from Guilty Gears more edgy style but found that most matches were slow and that the colorful art direction and Japanese voices would only appeal to a niche audience Game Informer declared that the presentation of Battle Fantasia was charming with all the vibrancy and artistic style of an anime yet it did little to revolutionize the genre despite adding traditional roleplaying game aesthetics such as longwinded story segments IGN called the games character design lighthearted and appealing but that the total cast size of only twelve playable characters was relatively small compared to other fighting games and that background designs were oftentimes bland and ugly In regards to the games technical aspects IGN felt the game lacking when compared to more highprofile titles such as Segas Virtua Fighter 5 and that gameplay was more about timing and calculated moves than massive combos or memorizing deep move sets Anime News Network ranked it fourth on their list of video games that deserved far more attention than they received saying what sets it apart is the look of the backgrounds and characters

European versions of Battle Fantasia in early 2009 were often compared to Capcoms highly anticipated Street Fighter IV released just one month after Eurogamer claimed that the game was not even in the same league as Capcoms superlative reenvisioning yet compared its defensive Gachi parrying system to Street Fighter III The website would criticize the titles bythenumbers gameplay and lack of online competition and called Battle Fantasias art style a nice departure but many will find the overly twee presentation a bit too sugary for their fighter tastes Play UK also commented on the games release stating that Six months ago we would have happily recommended it as a stopgap to Street Fighter IV but we just cant say that now Journalists for the magazine would pan the titles lack of gameplay options and called the story mode a joke Ironically though it was often found to be inferior to Street Fighter IV series director Yoshinori Ono cited the original arcade version of Battle Fantasia in 2007 as the inspiration for his games new threedimensional art style stating Our fear was that with Street Fighter IV because our characters are taller and more humanproportioned that it might look funky What we learned through development was that no its not going to look weird Battle Fantasia was part of what made us realize that I think

The Australian team was managed by John Conway and captained by Dave Gregory William Gibbes who was a nonplayer acted as the teams assistantmanager and secretary Conway was a journalist from Geelong Victoria while Gregory and Gibbes were both Sydneybased accountants working for the New South Wales Public Service These three cricket enthusiasts were the architects of the venture They and the players each contributed the sum of 50 to finance the expedition and later shared equally in the handsome profits that their enterprise generated having carted the match takings around with them in a closely guarded strongbox all the time that they were away

Gregory demonstrated excellent leadership and tactical skills throughout the long tour while Fred Spofforth became the star performer of the team Cricket scholars consider him to have been one of the greatest fast bowlers in the history of the game

During the English tour of Australia in 187677 the Australian allrounder and impresario John Conway met the English captain James Lillywhite in Melbourne and discussed the potential profitability of an Australian team visiting England Lillywhite agreed to take soundings at home and see if the major English teams would consider hosting a team of the best cricketers in the colonies During the 1877 English season Lillywhite made enquiries and was encouraged by the feedback He contacted Conway to report interest and with the possibility of good money offered to arrange a fixture list Conway negotiated with Dave Gregory who had captained the Combined XI from Sydney and Melbourne against Lillywhites professionals in what latterly became recognised as the first two Test matches It was agreed that the players would form a private company by contributing 50 each to cover expenses profits to be shared accordingly although Conway as manager would take 75 of gross proceeds

The team sailed from Sydney on 29 March 1878 in the  reaching San Francisco on 27 April having called at Auckland and Honolulu en route They then traveled across America by train a potentially hazardous undertaking in the era of the JamesYounger Gang and others though Frank and Jesse James were still in hiding after the abortive Northfield Raid in 1876 The Australians sailed from New York on 4 May in the  which docked at Liverpool on 13 May The team caught the train to Nottingham and arrived there at 1215 on 14 May to a large reception On 20 May they began their first match at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire

The Australian party was composed of J Conway Victoria manager W C V Gibbes assistantmanager D W Gregory New South Wales captain F E Allan Victoria G H Bailey Tasmania A C Bannerman New South Wales C Bannerman New South Wales J McC Blackham Victoria wicketkeeper H F Boyle Victoria T W Garrett New South Wales T P Horan Victoria W E Midwinter Victoria W L Murdoch New South Wales and F R Spofforth New South Wales Midwinter was already in England and joined the team in Nottingham for their opening game

27 May MCC versus Australians at Lords The Australians established their reputation for all time by a nine wicket victory inside five hours in one of the most sensational games in history A strong MCC team led by W G Grace himself was bowled out for 33 Spofforth 64 including a hat trick and though they in turn dismissed the Aussies for 41 Shaw 510 Morley 531 MCC in their second innings were out for just 19 Boyle 53 Spofforth 516 The Australians needed 12 to win which was a substantial total in the conditions but they lost only their star batsman Charles Bannerman in getting them Spofforths match analysis was 143 overs five maidens 20 runs 11 wickets This match inspired Punch to publish the following verse

20  22 June Middlesex versus Australians at Lords and Surrey versus Gloucestershire at The Oval Shortly before play was due to begin at Lords WG Grace and others of the Gloucestershire camp turned up and effectively nabbed Billy Midwinter taking him to the Oval to play for Gloucestershire Midwinter had played for them in 1877 and Grace argued that he was bound to continue if required Since Gloucestershire had arrived at the Oval with only ten players Midwinter most definitely was required

A dispute ensued and all sorts of agreements and contractual arrangements were argued over It seems that WG was at first rude and insulting then tried to brazen it out before offering a guarded apology and eventually getting around to his favourite topic money Midwinter apparently did quite well out of it all despite being anything but an innocent party The Aussies got some satisfaction when they beat Middlesex by 98 runs without Midwinter while Gloucestershire with Midwinter lost by 16 runs to Surrey But the real revenge came later

5  6 Sept Gloucestershire versus Australians Clifton College Australians won by 10 wkts This was the champion countys only home defeat of the season All three Graces were playing but not Midwinter Aussie revenge was complete thanks to a 1290 match haul by the Demon though he did not get WGs wicket

11  12 Sept Players versus Australians at Princes Ground ended the Australian tour and was also the last time Princes Ground in Chelsea was used as a firstclass venue Middlesex having moved to Lords in 1877

At the end of their tour the Australians sailed from Liverpool on 18 September in the  They arrived in New York over a week later and went on to Philadelphia where they played the Philadelphian cricket team on 35 October at the Germantown Ground This match which is now unofficially rated firstclass was disrupted by disputes and walkoffs before it ended in a draw The tourists played five other games all minor fixtures in Hoboken Toronto Montreal St Louis and San Francisco They sailed from San Francisco on 28 October in the  arriving in Sydney on 25 November after being away for almost eight months

Ancillary note In San Francisco the Australian team had played a California XXII side composed of members from the Occidental and Oakland Cricket Clubs The Oakland club was the first cricket team established on the East Bay which became home to several cricket teams between 1878 and 1913 This was the first time a California side played an Australian national side

Meanwhile back in England the Graces endured months of controversy about the payments they received as supposed amateurs much of which had come to light as a result of the Midwinter affair Charges were brought against them at a stormy meeting of the Gloucestershire clubs members and they were vilified in the press In the end little came of it The Graces had too much influence WG was simply too popular to be challenged and EM as a coroner was seen to be a pillar of the community So although their ears burned they escaped censure and nothing much changed

Krabat novel
Krabat is a fantasy novel about the eponymous Sorbian folk hero written by Otfried Preuler The book deals primarily with black magic and the lure of evil Other themes include friendship love and death It won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis Prize for Literature for Young People in 1972
br

The book was first published in 1971 and in an English translation first as The Satanic Mill from 1972 to 1991 then republished in 2000 as The Curse of the Darkling Mill in 2011 as Krabat and in 2014 as Krabat and the Sorcerers Mill

Set in the mid 17th century during the Thirty Years War the story follows the life of Krabat a 14yearold Wendish beggar boy living in the eastern part of Saxony For three consecutive nights he is called to a watermill near the village Schwarzkollm through a dream Upon heeding the call and arriving at the mill he begins his apprenticeship as a millers man He soon joins the secret brotherhood composed of journeymen and apprentices and discovers that the skill he is meant to learn through this apprenticeship is Black Magic The first magic powers Krabat acquires are rather harmless such as the ability to turn himself into a raven Other peculiarities of this watermill include the lack of any outside visitors including farmers who would have brought grain The only visitor to the mill is one Goodman who may be the devil although this is never made explicit

The senior journeyman Tonda Krabats best friend and older brother figure dies ostensibly of an accident on New Years Eve in Krabats first year at the mill Tonda offers strangely little resistance to his own death Krabats suspicions of foul play are further reinforced when another journeyman and friend Michal dies the following New Years Eve He soon realizes that the master is bound in a pact to the Goodman the master must sacrifice one journeyman every year on New Years Eve or perish himself

Wishing to take revenge for his friends death Krabat secretly trains to increase his magical strength so he can fight the master His quest is aided by a girl from the nearby village a church singer Kantorka whose name is never mentioned Kantorka meaning just little chorister Krabat learns that to end the spell his lover must challenge the master for him then whoever loses the challenge the master or the two lovers will die The master offers Krabat another solution He will retire and let Krabat inherit the mill along with the pact to the Goodman but Krabat refuses to perpetuate the evil pact So the challenge goes ahead and the girls task is to distinguish Krabat from the rest of the journeymen all of them are standing in a row while she is blindfolded She manages to pick him out by the fact that he fears mainly for her life while the others fear mainly for their own Ultimately she rescues Krabat from death and they and the journeymen escape the mill The master is left to die in the burning mill on New Years Eve while the survivors lose all their magic powers and are now simple millers who have to provide for themselves through normal hard work

The characters of this novel provide a stark distinction between good and evil Krabat his love interest Kantorka Tonda Juro and Michal stand for the side of the good whereas the master of the mill the Goodman and the one journeyman who betrays his brothers stand for the bad There are however a few journeymen who are indifferent or ambiguous to the ongoing struggle and who neither support nor oppose the master

Although the story is quite close to the original Sorbian tale of Krabat that dates back to the 18th century Preuler himself also considered it to tell the story of himself his generation and all young people who encounter power and its temptations and get ensnarled by it

The story was adapted into a 1977 Czech animated film arodjv ue The Sorcerers Apprentice directed by Karel Zeman

The band ASP started with a musical version of the story in 12 parts in 2006 In 2008 they finished the project with a 15track album on two CDs called Zaubererbruder ie SorcererBrother

Marco Kreuzpaintners film adaptation of Otfried Preulers book also named Krabat was released in Germany on October 9 2008

The 1975 television film Die schwarze Mhle is based on a different novelization of the same folk tale by Jurij Brzan

Krabat is also the main character of three novels written by the Sorbian writer Jurij Brzan published in 1968 1976 and 1993

Jacob ben Judah Landau
Jacob ben Judah Landau died 1493  was a GermanItalian rabbi and halakhic codifier

Landau lived in the second half of the 15th century His father was one of the chief authorities on the Talmud in Germany hundreds of Talmudists among them naturally his son were his pupils Landau left Germany and settled in Italy living first in Pavia 1480 and then in Naples 1487

In Naples some time between 1487 and 1492 he published his code Agur He composed this for his pupil Ezra Abraham b David Obadiah because the latters time being devoted to physics and metaphysics he could not enter deeply into the study of the Talmud see introduction to Agur This practical consideration determined the form of the Agur which contains only those rules that a layman should know and comprises principally an abridged presentation of the material treated in the first and second parts of the Turim The author of the Turim Jacob ben Asher is Landaus chief authority and the Agur may be considered really as a supplement to that work In the Agur Landau gives excerpts from the halakhic literature which appeared after the time of Jacob ben Asher

Although the Agur possesses little originality it held an important position among law codes and is often quoted especially by Joseph Caro in the Shulchan Aruch German influence on the religious practices of the Italians was increased by Landaus work such authorities as Jacob Mlin Isserlein and other Germans having been little noticed by Italians before him The Agur was the first Jewish work to contain a rabbinical approbation besides being the second Hebrew book printed during the authors lifetime see Jew Encyc ii 27 sv Approbation

At the end of the Agur Landau gave a number of conundrums relating to halakhah under the title Sefer Chazon which were afterward published separately Venice 1546 Prague 1608

Drying tube
A drying tube or guard tube is a tubelike piece of apparatus used to house a disposable solid desiccant wherein at one end the tubelike structure terminates in a ground glass joint for use in connecting the drying tube to a reaction vessel for the purpose of keeping the vessel free of moisture

The tubelike structure is often bent and can also widen to form a bulbdesiccant reservoir Typically a drying tube is 12cm wide and 510cm long and bent at an angle of about 90 degrees In use the drying tube is filled with a rechargeable desiccant such as calcium chloride and the open end of drying tube is partially blocked eg with wool glasswool or a bungcork which has a small bore made in it and the drying tube is connected to the apparatus to be kept dry via the ground glass joint If the drying tube is bent the bend is oriented so that solid desiccant does not fall into the reaction vessel Some drying tubes have a glass sinter to prevent desiccant falling into the reaction vessel Drying tubes are often prepared in advance and the desiccant can be replaced when exhausted
Reactions which are being heated or which evolve gases must never be sealed because an overpressure may shatter the vessel Drying tubes are usually fitted on top of the reflux condenser allowing the pressure to be relieved while excluding atmospheric moisture

Drying tubes are often used in lessdemanding applications typically in organic syntheses While the reaction is often carried out at room temperature the solvent usually volatile diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran is already able to displace air directly making additional measures to exclude atmospheric moisture less important

An oil bubbler may be a useful substitute In this case gases are allowed to escape but air is not able to enter because the bubbler acts as a oneway valve Oil bubblers can tolerate an underpressure in the reaction vessel Oil is sucked into a sump in lieu of air However if the pressure in the reaction vessel falls too low the oil may be sucked into the reaction vessel contaminating it

For more demanding applications a Schlenk line or glovebox may be used to provide an atmosphere of dry inert gas such as argon or nitrogen

Professional regurgitator
A professional regurgitator is an entertainer whose act consists of swallowing and regurgitating various unusual objects The objects may consist of anything from live animals live mice The Great Waldo to light bulbs billiard balls Stevie Starr and kerosene Hadji Ali

Some magicians perform regurgitation as part of their act for instance Harry Houdini but professional regurgitators may perform regurgitation exclusively In some cases there is debate as to whether demonstrations are true feats of regurgitation or tricks For example Stevie Starr as part of his performance has swallowed an unsolved Rubiks Cube then regurgitated a solved cube

Skilurus
Skilurus or Scylurus was the best known king of Scythia in the 2nd century BC He was the son of a king and the father of a king but the relation of his dynasty to the previous one is disputed His realm included the lower reaches of the Borysthenes and Hypanis as well as the northern part of Crimea where his capital Scythian Neapolis was situated 

Skilurus ruled over the Tauri and controlled the ancient trade emporium of Pontic Olbia where he minted coins In order to gain advantage against Chersonesos he allied himself with the Sarmatian tribe of Rhoxolani In response Chersonesos forged an alliance with Mithridates VI of Pontus Skilurus died during a war against Mithridates a decisive conflict for supremacy in the Pontic steppe Soon after his death the Scythians were defeated by Mithridates ca 108 BC Either Skilurus or his son and successor Palacus were buried in a mausoleum at Scythian Neapolis it was used from ca 100 BC to ca 100 AD

PseudoPlutarch in Sayings of Kings and Commanders reports the following version of the Aesopic fable The Old Man and his Sons Scilurus on his deathbed being about to leave eighty sons surviving offered a bundle of darts to each of them and bade them break them When all refused drawing out one by one he easily broke them thus teaching them that if they held together they would continue strong but if they fell out and were divided they would become weak cf Unity makes strength

GCS Cars
GCS Gary Colin Specialist Cars traded initially from Orpington in Kent UK and produced the Hawke Although similar to the Burlington SS in some respects the GCS Hawke was developed completely independently by the partners in GCS Cars with considerably different dimensions overall The DorianBurlington was designed to fit on a Triumph chassis although Dorian later developed a chassis that it is believed was using Escort parts The GCS Hawke was designed to fit on a ladderframe chassis to accept CortinaSierra parts This led to the bodyshell and wings being considerably wider than the original DorianBurlington car It is an open two seater modelled fairly closely but differently enough on the Morgan Whereas the Burlington body tub was constructed of glassfibre wood and aluminium the Hawke has a onepiece GRP bodyshell with integral floor It can take a variety of engines from Ford and the V8 Rover The company was founded by Garry Hutton and Collin Puttock

The company was eventually sold to Tiger Racing but then sold to LCD LC Developments Ltd founded in 2003 by Richard John Laking and Paul John Chapman who currently both manufacture the car and supply the car as a kit

Settlement structural
Settlement in a structure refers to the distortion or disruption of parts of a building due to

Settlement should not be confused with subsidence which results from the loadbearing ground upon which a building sits reducing in level for instance in areas of mine workings where shafts collapse underground

Some settlement is quite normal after construction has been completed but unequal differential settlement may cause significant problems for buildings Traditional green oakframed buildings are designed to settle with time as the oak seasons and warps lime mortar rather than Portland cement is used for its elastic properties and glazing will often employ small leaded lights which can accept movement more readily than larger panes

Saint Lukes Home for Destitute and Aged Women
St Lukes Home for Destitute and Aged Women was incorporated by an act of the Connecticut State Assembly on June 22 1865 For twentyseven years the home was conducted in an old house on the southwest corner of Court and Pearl Street in 1892 a large legacy enabled a new home to be erected at the present site at Pearl and Lincoln Streets Comfortable quarters are provided for fourteen women Members of the Church of the Holy Trinity played a large part in establishing the endowment frequently the current rector of that church serves as president of the Board of Trustees

The substantial brick building looks like a carefully designed apartment house rather than an institution At threeandahalf stories tall the f37irst floor is partly below ground level A long run of brownstone steps leads to a center entrance door on the second floor level Two bay window piers flank the front entrance capped off above the roof line by gableroofed dormers Decorative elements such as the wrought iron fence ivy on the facade and quoinlike brick projections on all corners add a picturesque quality to the building

The large brick institutional building dominates the area by its mass and corner siting at Pearl and Lincoln Streets in Middletowns residential North End It forms a dividing line between large structures to the south towards Washington Street and more modest late Victorian era worker homes to the north

Rockwallaby
The rockwallabies are the wallabies of the genus Petrogale

The genus was established in 1837 by John Edward Gray in a revision of material at the British Museum of Natural History Gray nominated his earlier description of Kangurus pencillatus as the type species now recognised in the combination Petrogale penicillata brushtail rockwallaby The author separated the species from the defunct genus Kangurus which he proposed to divide in his synopsis of the known macropod species

The mediumsized often colourful and extremely agile rockwallabies live where rocky rugged and steep terrain can provide daytime refuge Males are slightly larger than females with a body length of up to 59cm and a 70cm long tail

Rockwallabies are nocturnal and live a fortress existence spending their days in steep rocky complex terrain in some kind of shelter cave overhang or vegetation and ranging out into surrounding terrain at night for feed The greatest activity occurs three hours before sunrise and after sunset

Their reliance on refuges leads to the rockwallabies living in small groups or colonies with individuals having overlapping home ranges of about 15 hectares each Within their colonies they seem to be highly territorial with a males territory overlapping one or a number of female territories Even at night the wallabies do not move further than two kilometres from their home refuges

Generally there are three categories of habitat that the different species of rockwallaby seem to prefer

Suitable habitat is limited and patchy and has led to varying degrees of isolation of colonies and a genetic differentiation specific to these colonies
The rock wallaby height is ranges from 60cm to 70cm

Their total numbers and range have been drastically reduced since European colonisation with populations becoming extinct from the south

The ongoing extinction of colonies in recent times is of particular concern In 1988 at Jenolan Caves in New South Wales for example a caged population of 80 rockwallabies was released to boost what was thought to be an abundant local wild population By 1992 the total population was down to about seven The survivors were caught and enclosed in a fox and catproof enclosure and the numbers in this captive population have since begun to increase

Scientists consider foxes the major reason for the recent extinctions along with competing herbivores especially goats sheep and rabbits diseases such as toxoplasmosis and hydatidosis habitat fragmentation and destruction and a lower genetic health due to the increasing isolation of colonies

Habitat conservation and pest management addressing foxes and goats appear to be the most urgent recovery actions to save the species

The national recovery team with support from nongovernment organisations such as the Foundation for National Parks  Wildlife has implemented various programs ranging from land acquisition to captive breeding and awareness raising projects

Monitoring programs are implemented to register any changes in population sizes Genetic surveys establish the genetic diversity of populations Fox and goat eradication aid the survival of local populations and captive breeding programs are used as an insurance policy to build up wallaby numbers to boost wild populations

In the case of the yellowfooted rockwallaby these strategies have prevented the extinction of the species in New South Wales

The following is a list of species with common names arranged by alliances of speciesgroups

Gas bubbler
A gas bubbler is a piece of laboratory glassware which consists of a glass bulb filled with a small amount of fluid  usually mineral or silicone oil less commonly mercury The inlet to the bulb is connected to a ground glass joint while the outlet is vented to the air

Gas bubblers are used to exclude air from a reaction or a system In the former case the gas bubbler is fitted on the condenser of the reaction setup In the latter case an oil bubbler is usually installed at the end of the inert gas manifold on a Schlenk line to prevent contamination by atmospheric oxygen and water

A gas bubbler acts as a oneway valve  gases hot air evolved gases solvent vapors from the inlet will bubble through the fluid before being vented to the atmosphere 
If there were an underpressure in the reaction vessel such as when heat is removed and the gases within contract some fluid is sucked into a sump to equalize the pressure instead of air Wherever possible such suck back should be avoided by filling the reaction apparatus with inert gas because an excessively low pressure will cause oil to be sucked into the reaction vessel contaminating it

The bubbles allow the worker to visibly confirm that the system is being flushed with inert gas the rate at which bubbles form allow the worker to adjust the inlet pressure

Oil bubblers are filled with mineral or silicone oil These are both quite resistant to chemical attack Oil bubblers are predominantly used the oil is inexpensive and not toxic

A drawback is that due to oils lower density in event of underpressure in the reaction vessel enough oil may be sucked through the sump into the inert gas system to contaminate it Due to the same reason the pressure within the inert gas system will always remain close to atmospheric This is a disadvantage when attempting cannula transfers using inert gas pressure to force a liquid reagent into another using a cannula

Mercury bubblers are largely similar in construction to oil bubblers They usually have a longer body to prevent mercury from splashing out through the bubbler outlet and the inlet connection usually has a sintered glass disc to prevent mercury from being sucked back into the inert gas system when refilling an evacuated vessel

The most important advantage of mercury over oil is that a fair amount of pressure can be maintained within the inert gas system equivalent to the height of the mercury column Tall columns may be used to exploit this further By increasing the pressure within the inert gas system boiling points are increased allowing reactions under reflux to be carried out at a higher temperature Also cannula transfers are accomplished more easily due to the greater gas pressure available to push a liquid reagent from a vessel through a cannula into another vessel

Mercury bubblers are avoided where possible due to the difficulty and expense in dealing with mercury spills In addition mercury can react with various chemicals such as ammonia and acetylenes with potentially hazardous results In the context of cannula transfer mercury bubblers may be avoided by pulling instead of pushing liquids through the cannula by vacuum Alternatively the oil bubbler may be closed off from the inert gas line with a stopcock allowing inert gas to push the reagent through the cannula Excess pressure is bled off from a bubbler fitted directly over the receiving vessel

Sioux City Symphony Orchestra
The Sioux City Symphony Orchestra is an American orchestra based in Sioux City Iowa Its home is the Orpheum Theater

The Sioux City Symphony Orchestra and The Sioux City Municipal Band were each formed in the early 1930s under the guidance and direction of Leo Kucinski Under Kucinskis leadership the orchestra gradually developed into a highly respected paidprofessional Class B civic orchestra with a regular performing season The orchestra originally performed in the Sioux City Municipal Auditorium but in 2001 moved to the restored historic Orpheum Theater

The Municipal Band with close kinship to the orchestra is also a paidprofessional group that traces its origins to The Monahan Post 64 Band of the American Legion in the 1920s The Monahan Post Band became worldfamous when it was selected as the official band of the American Legion in the mid1920s From its founding until the early 1930s The Monahan Post Band made several tours that included concert appearances in New York City New Orleans and Paris The home of the Municipal Band is the city band shell in Grandview Park

Sioux Citys ability to produce highly gifted musicians for fine music of all styles can be attributed to its citizens very strong and longstanding commitment to and financial investment in music education within the public and private school systems In the 1930s Kucinski worked closely with Superintendent of Schools MG Clark to create the foundation for its public school music program Additionally Morningside College has long been home to a vital and energetic music department which has served to contribute to the pool of fine musicians and music educators in Sioux City Sioux City has an AllCity Orchestra whose members are elementary grade students who participate by audition and the Siouxland Youth Symphony whose players are selected by competitive auditions from the junior schools and high schools in the area

After Kucinski other music directors of the orchestra have included Thomas Lewis Stephen Rogers Radcliffe and Xian Zhang Xian Zhang had originally been contracted to the orchestra for 3 years but resigned after 2 years because of her schedule demands In March 2009 the orchestra announced the appointment of Ryan Haskins as its next music director as of 1 July 2009

Counterpoint radio programme
Counterpoint is a BBC Radio 4 quiz Described in the shows introduction as The general knowledge music quiz the questions are about music from classical jazz pop musicals and all other forms of music It was originally hosted by Ned Sherrin 19862006 In the chair for the 2007 series was Edward Seckerson with Paul Gambaccini taking over in 2008 following the death of Ned Sherrin in 2007 Russell Davies took over temporarily in 2013 following allegations made against Gambaccini who returned to the show in November 2014 after being cleared of the allegations

The quiz is played by three contestants over three rounds or movements as they are known in the show

In the first round each contestant is asked four or occasionally three if there is a shortage of time questions two of which are illustrated by short musical pieces Two points are awarded for a correct answer or one point for a partially correct response If the given answer is incorrect or partially incorrect the other two contestants may buzz in for one point If there is a tie at the end of the first round a further buzzer question is asked to determine the contestants order for the next round

The middle round is a solo round similar to the specialist subject format of Mastermind with the difference that the contestants have neither chosen nor been given warning of the subject Five categories of questions are offered some of which are very specific eg Beethovens Piano Sonatas while others are more general for instance sunshine and rain The contestant with the most points after round one chooses from the five categories the runnerup chooses from the four remaining and the contestant in last place chooses from the three that are left Each round consists of seven occasionally six questions including three musical cues Again two points are given for a correct answer but in this round questions answered incorrectly are not offered to the other contestants

The final round consists of a variable number of questions usually no more than twenty Any contestant can answer these questions provided they buzz in first A correct answer will add one point to a contestants score If an incorrect answer is given a contestant is deducted one point

The contestant with the highest score at the end of each regular show wins the right to appear again later in the series to compete against other winners from the current series The series is completed in 13 weeks the last show being the final at the end of which the series winner is decided

The show has been broadcast in BBC Radio 4s Monday afternoon quiz slot since 1998 with a repeat on the following Saturday evening Three main questionsetters have been used by the programme Ian Gillies often referred to as Mycroft by Robert Robinson in Brain of Britain 19862000 David Kenrick the 1993 champion 1993  referred to as  Clever Mr Kochel  by Ned Sherrin  and Stephen Follows a semifinalist 1996  2002   Counterpoint has been produced since 2001 by Paul Bajoria In November 2014 Paul Gambaccini returned to present the programme after being cleared of allegations against him In his absence the programme had been hosted by Russell Davies

The following is an incomplete list of Counterpoint champions since 1988

The current Counterpoint theme is Bachs Partita in E major arranged and performed by Jacques Loussier The original theme tune for the programme when it began in 1986 was the Arrival of the Queen of Sheba by Georg Friedrich Handel In the late 1990s it was opened by a specially commissioned piece entitled Counterpoint by musician Ray Davies

Atlantic spiny rat
The Atlantic spiny rats are all found in the genus Trinomys They are a group of South American spinyrats in the family Echimyidae

Based on Natureserve 

The species of spiny rats in the genus Trinomys are apparently all Brazilian In particular many of them are endemic to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil Not much is known for certain about their ranges however which still are being investigated with frequent extensions to the recorded distributions of several species in various ecological classes of forest and dry land They do not however appear to occur at high altitudes and several of their ranges appear to be parapatric

Trinomys is the sister genus to the fossorial genera Clyomys and Euryzygomatomys
In turn these three genera  forming the clade of Euryzygomatomyinae  share phylogenetic affinities with a clade containing Carterodon and members of the family Capromyidae

In 1986 Randy Merrell sought to return to his previous life as a maker of custom boots and sold his share of the company bearing his name That same year the company sold its 25000th pair of boots

In 1987 Merrell was purchased by Karhu The new owners moved production of Merrell products to Asia reducing retail prices and expanding sales In 1988 sales of Merrell products topped the 4 million mark

A period of rapid growth for Merrell followed with 1989 sales increasing by 50 to the 6 million mark By 1990 some 300000 pairs of shoes and boots were being sold annually with sales for the year topping the 10 million mark for the first time The company became a global enterprise with divisions established in Canada the United Kingdom Scandinavia and the United States

In 1997 Karhu sold Merrell to Wolverine World Wide a large footwear corporation which manufactured Hush Puppies shoes and Wolverine brand boots In the year of the Wolverine acquisition Merrell sales volume totaled 23 million

Wolverine introduced a new lighterweight sensibility to the line beginning with a trail running shoe called the Jungle Runner This initial foray into lightweight footwear was not a commercial success but a team led by Clark Matis came up with the idea of using a very aggressive trail running outsole with a casual slipon upper made of pigskin suede a material previously perfected and used extensively in the Hush Puppies line

The work of Matis design group culminated with the introduction of what would become the brands signature shoe the Jungle Moc The new product was a smash success with total shipments of Jungle Mocs hitting 35 million pairs by 2002 The 10 millionth pair of Jungle Mocs was shipped in 2009 with the style continuing in production to the present date

Monty Python amp the Quest for the Holy Grail
Monty Python  the Quest for the Holy Grail is an adventure game created by 7th Level in 1996 for Windows The game is based on the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail and was the second of three Monty Python games created by 7th Level

The games aesthetics are a mixture of photo realistic rendering and the comic style of Terry Gilliam The objective is to move through the world and collect a series of objects in order to cross the bridge of death The game also contains a series of sketches and audio clips not present in the film including an alternative reason for the minstrels disappearance

Many minigames are available to play along the way including a Tetris clone using dead plague victims a WhacAMole game where a knight has to spank virgins in a bed points are deducted for spanking the barecheeked women and a Simon says game where the player has to remember the order that four different coloured burning witches scream in The majority of the game is a point and click interface where the player must also collect items to complete puzzles and complete the missing planks on the bridge of death

Global sales of Holy Grail Complete Waste of Time and Desktop Pythonizer surpassed 650000 copies by November 1997 which accounted for revenues above 15 million at 7th Level

A Next Generation critic said Monty Python  the Quest for the Holy Grail lacks any semblance of decent gameplay He elaborated that since there is no indicator of where the hot spots are the gameplay consists of little more than blindly clicking everywhere on the screen to see what happens Despite this he said that enthusiasts of the film would probably still enjoy the game due to the previously unseen video clips included on it

MacUser named Quest for the Holy Grail one of 1996s top 50 CDROMs while Inside Mac Games declared it the years best comedy game The latter publications editors wrote NonPython fans will probably wonder what the big deal is but even casual followers will be rolling on the floor The game was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 ClassicPuzzle Game of the Year award which ultimately went to Baku Baku Animal However it won the categorys Readers Choice award that year

Zapti
Zapti was the designation given to locally raised gendarmerie units in the Italian colonies of Tripolitania Cyrenaica later Italian Libya Eritrea and Somaliland between 1889 and 1943

The word zapti is derived from the Turkish zapiteh a term which was used to refer to both the Ottoman Empires gendarmerie prior to 1923 and to the Turkish personnel recruited for the Cyprus Military Police during the period of British rule on the island

The Italian colonial governments in the territories listed above modelled the various zapti constabulary forces on Italys own carabinieri The first of these units was raised in Eritrea in 1882 drawing from existing companies of basci bazuks irregular troops

In Tripolitania and Cyrenaica the Italian officered zapti were generally used for patrolling rural areas in coastal regions while mounted police or spahis operated in the southern desert regions together with camel mounted meharists In the city of Tripoli civilian police were employed The original Libyan zapti were recruited from indigenous gendarmerie of the same name who had served under the Turkish government prior to 1910 

In Italian Somaliland the zapti provided a ceremonial escort for the Italian Viceroy Governor as well as the territorial police There were nearly one thousand such paramilitary police in 1922 when Benito Mussolini took control of the Italian government and started a policy of pacification and assimilation of the Italian colonies 

Zapti troopers were armed with 1874 model revolvers cavalry carbines and 1871 model sabres Officers and some noncommissioned officers were Italian but the rank and file were recruited from the colony in question As an example the Somali Zapti Corps in 1927 numbered 1500 Somali and 72 Italian personnel Uniforms varied from colony to colony but usually comprised fezes red sashes and khaki or white clothing A common feature was the white and red collar insignia of the carabinieri

Three hundred zapti took part in the Italian conquest of northern Somalia in 1925 As part of the colonna Musso they assisted in the occupation of the Sultanate of Hobyo Hafun and Ordio Other zapt units served with the colonna Bergesio in the Elemari region Gallacaio Garad and Sinedog In 1926 zapt served in the Majeerteen Sultanate Bender Ziada Candala and Bender Cassim

Zapt detachments participated in the Italian conquest of Ethiopia in 1936 and in the East African Campaign of World War II

In 1941 in Somalia and Ethiopia 2186 zapt plus 500 recruits under training formed part of the Carabinieri They were organised in a battalion commanded by Major Alfredo Serranti that fought at the Battle of Culqualber in Ethiopia for three months until this military unit was destroyed by the Allies After heavy fighting the Italian Carabinieri received full military honors from the British

In this battle Muntaz corporal Unat Endisciau of the LXXII Zapti I Gruppo Carabinieri Battalion was the only soldier of colour to be awarded the Italian Gold Medal of Military Valor

After World War II a former member of the zapt corps Siad Barre became President of Somalia from 1969 to 1991

Frisking
Frisking also called a patdown or pat down is a search of a persons outer clothing wherein a person runs his or her hands along the outer garments to detect any concealed weapons

In the United States a law enforcement officer may briefly detain a person upon reasonable suspicion of involvement in a crime but short of probable cause to arrest such a detention is known as a Terry stop When a search for weapons is also authorized the procedure is known as a stop and frisk To justify the stop a law enforcement officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts
that would indicate to a reasonable person that a crime has been is being or is about to be committed 

If the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect is in possession of a weapon that is of danger to the officer or others the officer may conduct a frisking of the suspects outer garments to search for weapons The search must be limited to what is necessary to discover weapons
however pursuant to the plain feel doctrine police may seize contraband discovered in the course of a frisk but only if the contrabands identity is immediately apparent

The New York City Police Department has come under scrutiny for its use of the Terry stop Supporters say that it reduces crime but civil rights advocates say it is racial profiling John A Eterno a former city police captain describes My take is that this has become more like a throw a wide net and see what you can find kind of thing I dont see it as targeted enforcement especially when you see numbers that we are talking about
Looking at eight odd blocks of Brownsville Brooklyn a study found that between January 2006 and March 2010 the police made nearly 52000 stops In a later review of that article about NYCs Stop Question and Frisk program as well as the larger issue of blacks welcome in the city a columnist wrote there were a record 580000 stopandfrisks in the city in 2009 Most of those stopped 55 percent were black a large portion were also Hispanic most were young and almost all were male For reference according to the Census Bureau there were about only 300000 black men between the ages of 13 and 34 living in the city that year 6 percent of the stops resulted in arrests

Corydon Historic District
The Corydon Historic District is a national historic district located in Corydon Indiana United States The town of Corydon is also known as Indianas First State Capital and as Historic Corydon The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 but the listing was amended in 1988 to expand the districts geographical boundaries and include additional sites The district includes numerous historical structures most notably the Old Capitol Indianas first state capitol building the Old Treasury Building Indianas first state office building Governor Hendricks Headquarters the Constitution Elm Memorial the Posey House the KintnerMcGrain House Cedar Glade and The Kintner House Inn as well as other residential and commercial sites

Corydon Indiana which was platted in 1808 continues to serve as the county seat of government for Harrison County Indiana The town served as the second capital of the Indiana Territory from 1813 to 1816 but it is best known for its service as the first capital of Indiana from 1816 to 1825 Some of the most significant structures within the historic district date from this early period of the towns history including the Old Capitol the centerpiece of the district

Corydon became the seat of government for the Indiana Territory when the territorial capital was moved from Vincennes in Knox County shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812 Dennis Pennington a Harrison County representative and the speaker of the territorial legislatures lower house helped secure Corydons selection as the capital by pointing out that the Harrison County Courthouse which the county government planned to build on Corydons public square could be used as an assembly building for the territorial legislature Pennington was awarded the contract to supervise construction of the courthouse which became known as the Old Capitol

In addition to its role as the capitol of the Indiana Territory Corydon served as the site of a constitutional convention to consider statehood for Indiana in 1816 Fortythree delegates convened from June 10 to June 29 1816 to draft Indianas first state constitution Sources disagree on the exact location of the gathering Because the courthouse was not completed at that time the delegates met at the courthouse on the hill which may have referred to a nearby log home that the territorial government had rented Cramped conditions and the summer heat caused the men to gather under a giant elm tree which was later named the Constitution Elm The towns historic district includes a portion of the trees preserved trunk surrounded by a sandstone memorial

The Indiana General Assembly met for the first time at Corydon under the new constitution and state government on November 4 1816 and Indiana was admitted as the nineteenth state in the Union on December 11 1816 Corydon served as the first state capital of Indiana from 1816 to 1825 when the seat of state government was moved to Indianapolis
When the historic district was first added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 the area encompassed eight sites that existed when Corydon became the capital of Indiana in 1816 These include the Old Capitol building Harrison County Courthouse along with the public square surrounding it Indianas first state office building also known as the Old Treasury Building Governor William Hendricks Headquarters the Constitution Elm the Posey House the Westfall House the Branham hometavern and the KintnerMcGrain House named Cedar Glade

In 1989 the district was extended to Indian Creek in the north and west east to College Avenue and south to Little Indian Creek to include additional historic structures The districts period of significance spans from 1808 to 1929 The districts boundary increase encompassed the eight structures from its early era as a territorial and state capital as well as commercial and residential buildings constructed after 1825 including a new threestory county Harrison County Courthouse that was completed in 1929

A historical marker erected on the Harrison County Courthouse lawn denotes the towns surrender to Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgans raiders following the Battle of Corydon on July 9 1863 The battle site which is located outside of town is listed separately on the National Register The districts courthouse square also includes a memorial to the late Indiana governor Frank OBannon his father Robert P Ocannon and grandfather Lew Ocannon all of whom were prominent in Corydon Plans for the OBannon memorial on the southwest corner of the courthouse square were announced on May 22 2007 It includes a lifesize bronze statue of Frank OBannon sitting on a limestone bench and three pillars honoring the OBannons The memorial which cost 200000 was dedicated in June 2008 Because of its history as a territorial and state capital Corydon sees an estimated 30000 visitors each year

The Old Capitol building a part of the Corydon Capital State Historic Site is administered by the Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites The twostory Federalstyle limestone building served as Indianas first state capitol from 1816 until 1825 The building was originally intended to serve as the Harrison County Courthouse Construction began in 1814 when Corydon was the capital of the Indiana Territory The building was nearly completed in 1816 the year that Indiana was granted statehood and its first state legislature convened at Corydon The building was primarily used as an assembly building for the territorial and state legislatures but the county government and district courts occasionally used it when the Indiana General Assembly was not in session Dennis Pennington who became the states first speaker of the Indiana Senate after statehood in 1816 supervised its construction

The twostory building is forty feet square with walls thick The exposed exterior of the building is not dressed using only stones that were cut roughly square The foundation dug into the ground is also thick The lower level has ceilings flagstone floors and a barn rail made from hewn timber The upper floors ceiling is tall The original building had a scale and balance on the roof as the symbol of justice but they were removed in 1833 and replaced with a large bell The construction cost of original building was approximately 3000 Two large chimneys that accommodated the four fireplaces installed in both the upper and lower levels were closed up during later renovations A wood floor covered the original flagstone floor

When Corydon became the state capital of Indiana in 1816 the Old Capitol building served as the seat of state government The Indiana Supreme Court and the Indiana Senate were located on the upper level the Indiana House of Representatives met on the first floor After 1825 when the state capital was moved to Indianapolis the Old Captol building continued to be used as the Harrison County Courthouse and county government office building until 1929 when a new county courthouse was completed

In 1917 the State of Indiana purchased the Old Capitol building with the intention of preserving it The restored building opened in 1929 and has since been preserved and protected as a memorial The Old Capitol sometimes referred to as the Corydon Capitol was included within the original boundaries of the Corydon Historic District when it was listed on the National Register in 1973 The building has been restored as closely as possible to its original appearance including furniture and paint colors In 2015 a major restoration project was completed on the town square to protect the Old Capitol building from water damage update the electrical system and landscaping and to install new walkways

The first state office building which dates from 1817 is also known as the Old Treasury Building It housed state government offices including the first state auditors and treasurers offices The building was included in the initial historic district designation It is located on Walnut Street east of the Governors Hendricks Headquarters The Indiana State Museum and Historic Sites Corporation began a major rehabilitation of this building in 2008

Acoustic transmission
Acoustic transmission is the transmission of sounds through and between materials including air wall and musical instruments

The degree to which sound is transferred between two materials depends on how well their acoustical impedances match 

Musical instruments are generally designed to radiate sound effectively A highimpedance part of the instrument such as a string transmits vibrations through a bridge intermediate impedance to a sound board lower impedance The soundboard then moves the still lowerimpedance air Without bridge and soundboard the instrument does not transmit enough sound to the air and is too quiet to be performed with An electric guitar has no soundboard it uses a microphone pickup and artificial amplification Without amplification electric guitars are very quiet

Stethoscopes roughly match the acoustical impedance of the human body so they transmit sounds from a patients chest to the doctors ear much more effectively than the air does Putting an ear to someones chest would have a similar effect

In building
Acoustic transmission in building design refers to a number of processes by which sound can be transferred from one part of a building to another Typically these are

ChinaSouth Korea relations
Diplomatic relations between the Peoples Republic of China and South Korea were formally established on August 24 1992 Throughout the 1950s 1960s 1970s and 1980s the PRC recognized only North Korea while South Korea in turn recognized only the Republic of China in Taiwan South Korea was the last Asian country to establish relations with the Peoples Republic of China In recent years China and South Korea have endeavored to boost their strategic and cooperative partnership in numerous sectors as well as promoting high level relationship Trade tourism and multiculturalism in specific have been the most important factors of strengthening two neighbouring countries cooperative partnership

While the dispute of THAAD had initiated conflicts between the two countries in various sectors at the end of October 2017 the two countries ended the 1yearlong diplomatic dispute and have been working swiftly to get their relationship back on track since strengthening exchanges and cooperation between each other creating harmony of interests and agreed to resume exchanges and cooperation in all areas All economic and cultural bans from China towards South Korea were also lifted as a result with political and security cooperation businesses and cultural exchanges between the two countries getting back to healthy state

Upon resumption of relationship China and South Korea have been organizing presidential and governmental visits working together on the Korean Peninsula assisting with the development of other countries and cooperating in numerous areas

The newly established Peoples Republic of China participated in the Korean War between 1950 and 1953 sending Peoples Volunteer Army to fight against South Korean and United Nations troops in October 1950 on the side of the North Koreans It successfully drove the UN forces out of North Korea but its own offensive into the South itself was repelled The participation of the PVA made the relations between South Korea and China hostile The Korean War concluded in July 1953 resulting in the establishment of the Korean Demilitarized Zone and the eventual withdraw of Chinese forces from the Korean Peninsula

Throughout the Cold War there were no official relations between communist China and capitalist South Korea The Peoples Republic of China maintained close relations with North Korea and South Korea maintained diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan This hindered trade between Seoul and Beijing because South Korea was unable to protect its citizens and business interests in China without some form of international agreements Beijings economic needs involving South Korea were initially eclipsed by those of Moscow

President Park Chunghee initiated and President Chun Doohwan advanced a policy of establishing relations with China and the Soviet Union and attempting to improve those with North Korea China and the USSR had significant sway in determining the future of the Korean Peninsula Good relations with old allies of North Korea were therefore integral to the Nordpolitik policy

Seouls official contact with Beijing started by the landing of a hijacked Chinese civilian airliner in May 1983 China sent a delegation of thirtythree officials to Seoul to negotiate its return This marked the beginning of a series of casual exchanges of citizens For example in March 1984 a South Korean tennis team visited Kunming for a Davis Cup match with a Chinese team In April 1984 a thirtyfourmember Chinese basketball team arrived in Seoul to participate in the Eighth Asian Junior Basketball Championships Some Chinese officials reportedly paid quiet visits to South Korea to inspect its industries while South Korean officials visited China to attend a range of international conferences

Active South KoreanChinese individual contacts have been encouraged Academics journalists and particularly families divided between South Korea and China were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s Significant numbers of citizens of each country reside in the other  more than 600000 PRC citizens reside in South Korea of whom 70 are ethnic Koreans from the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Chinas Jilin Province and other parts of China while roughly 560000 South Korean citizens lived in China

However significant barriers to strong trade and relations persisted The absence of any protections granted by official relations had still remained Beijing has been politically closer to Pyongyang and relations with North Korea remained tense and distrustful

It had been difficult for analysts to predict what effect a political turmoil in the Peoples Republic of China would have on SinoKorean relations After the military putdown of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square Beijing in June 1989 Pyongyang predictably came out in support of Beijings actions Seoul on the other hand did not condone or condemn the actions in Tiananmen Square

Trade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless Furthermore China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the United States and between North Korea and Japan and also initiated and promoted tripartite talksamong Pyongyang Seoul and Washington

South Korea had long been an ally of the Republic of China Diplomatic ties between Seoul and Taipei were nevertheless severed in 1992 Formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing on August 24 1992 and by 2004 China had become South Koreas leading trading partner

After the KORUS FTA United StatesKorea Free Trade Agreement was finalized on June 30 2007 the Chinese government has immediately begun seeking an FTA agreement with South Korea The FTA between Korea and China are under discussion and the ChinaRepublic of Korea Free Trade Agreement was finalized on December 20 2015 Tariffs on 958 products including medical equipment transformers etc were eliminated On January 1 2016 tariffs were eliminated on 5779 products for 2 years Also in 10 years it is estimated that the Chinese tariffs will gradually go down and be eliminated on 5846 products South Korea has been running a trade surplus with China which hit a record US325 billion in 2009 and total trade between the two nations surpassed US300 billion in 2014

On 29 November 2010 a United States diplomatic cables leak mentioned two unknown Chinese officials telling then ViceForeign Minister Chun Yungwoo that the PRC would favor a Korea reunified under the Souths government as long as it were not hostile to China

It was announced on 10 January 2011 that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade MOFAT established two teams of China experts and language specialists under its department handling Chinese affairs in an effort to strengthen diplomacy An analytical team will report on political economic and foreign affairs developments in China and a monitoring team consisting of seven language specialists will report on public sentiment in China The Institute of Foreign Affairs and National Security IFANS a thinktank affiliated to MOFAT also launched a centre dedicated to China affairs which will act as a hub to collate research on China undertaken in Korea

The ParkXi summit in 2013 showed promise of warming relations but this quickly chilled after China extended their Air Defense Identification Zone East China Sea over South Korean territory Despite this in July 2014 Xi visited South Korea before its traditional ally North Korea and in their talks both leaders affirmed their support for a nuclearfree Korean peninsula and the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations Both leaders also expressed their concerns over Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abes reinterpretation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution

In October 2016 South Korea lodged a formal complaint with Beijing accusing Chinese fishing boats of ramming and sinking a South Korean coast guard vessel The incident occurred on October 7 when South Korean coast guard officers were trying to stop about 40 Chinese fishing boats from suspected illegal fishing off South Koreas west coast The incidents of illegal Chinese entry continued and in November 1 2016 South Korea ships opened fire on illegal Chinese boats No casualties were reported

In late 2016 tension strengthened between China and the Republic of Korea after the United States and South Korea jointly announced the deployment of the Terminal HighAltitude Area Defense THAAD in response to the continuous nuclear and missile threats by North Korea However despite the USs statement that the deployment of the THAAD is purely a defensive measure only aimed at North Korea and has no intention to threaten Chinas security interests China has continuously expressed its discontent over South Korea and USs decision because of its concern that the deployment of THAAD might be a measure by the US to contain China

Alleging that the THAAD will undermine Chinas own nuclear deterrent capability Chinas Ambassador Qiu Guohong warned that the deployment of THAAD could destroy the ChinaSouth Korea ties in an instant whereas the spokesperson of the president of South Korea warned China that deploying the THAAD is a matter we will decide upon according to our own security and national interests 

As hostility grew upon the two states China and South Korea held a summit in Hangzhou eastern China on Sept 5 2016 with each partys leaders Xi Jinping and Park GeunHye to discuss the issue of THAAD During the summit President Park of South Korea reemphasized that the THAAD deployment is only to be aimed against North Korea and that there should be no reason for Chinas security interest to be concerned However Xi reiterated Chinas firm stance against the deployment of THAAD stating that it could intensify disputes Yet the two countries still emphasized the long history of their relationship and agreed that a stable and healthy bilateral relationship will benefit both countries

With South Koreas decision in 2017 to accept the deployment of THAAD in the country although Chinas government shied away from formal sanctions and measures it has urged its citizens through official media to express their displeasure and ill will at South Korea over the move In a country which strictly controls demonstrations and protests Chinese citizens were allowed to gather to show their anger The news media has reported of citizen boycotts of Korean products of Korean goods being removed from supermarket shelves and tourists and travel companies canceling trips to South Korea South Korean conglomerate Lotte Group became a particular focus of anger Lotte had agreed to an exchange of land a golf course in Seongju with the South Korean government that will be used for the THAAD deployment In addition to a consumer boycott of Lotte stores in China municipal authorities suddenly discovered that Lotte stores and factories to be in contravention of fire safety regulations and other local ordinances which has resulted in the closure of 75 out of 99 Lotte supermarkets March sales of Hyundai and its sister brand Kia Motors in China plunged 52 per cent from a year earlier to 72000 vehicles the lowest level since 2014 Chinese tourism also plummeted 394 compared to March 2016 in March As a result China has become a more hated country in South Korea than even Japan according to an opinion poll conducted by the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in March 2017

South Koreas distribution industry has had to struggle against the Chinese reaction to THAAD Chinese consumers were no longer attracted to Korean products and Chinese retailers boycotted Korean products So called economic revenge on Korea was severe and impacted on department stores duty free restaurants and the automobile industry However Korean conglomerates had to survive the revenge since China is the largest market in the world Hyundai motors one of the biggest conglomerates in Korea had to stop the operation of Chinese factories and the economic losses were significant The vicious cycle has been repeated as the decline of sales volume caused production suspension Chinese automobile component manufacturing companies suspended distribution to Hyundai automobile factories that are located in China and it negatively affected the management of Hyundai automobile THAAD had a tremendous impact on Korean economy in various business sectors and tarnished the brand value of Korean companies because of political reasons

Korean culture in the form Korean singers actors and dancers are popular with Chinese youth through the development of the internet and export of Korean cultural content After the THAAD dispute took place a limit Korea order  was placed upon Hallyu In China Hallyu cultural events were cancelled Korean actors had to quit from their works and limited Korean media could be exported to China The ban was lifted soon after and relations cooled

The Chinese historical claims surrounding Goguryeo and its related kingdoms created some tension between South and North Korea and the PRC The PRC government has recently begun the Northeast Project a controversial Chinese government research project claiming Goguryeo and other various Korean kingdoms including Gojoseon Buyeo and Balhae to be Chinese tributary states This sparked a massive uproar in South Korea when the project was widely publicized in 2004

The antecedent of the South Korea government received the support of China

Both the governments of China and South Korea take a firm stand on issues in relation to Japanese war crimes Korea had been under Japanese rule after the collapse of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910 During the Second SinoJapanese War Japan invaded and occupied eastern China

During World War II the Imperial Japanese Army perpetrated many war crimes against both Chinese and Koreans This has caused both to oppose the Japanese governments stand on war crimes committed in during the war Issues where both the Chinese and South Korean governments stand together include the controversial visits of Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine the Japanese history textbook controversies and comfort women

In 2014 a memorial dedicated to Korean assassin An Junggeun was opened in the Chinese city of Harbin where he assassinated Japanese Prime Minister It Hirobumi in 1909 The Japanese government protested the move referring to An as a terrorist

Senicide
Senicide or geronticide is the abandonment to death suicide or killing of the elderly

Societal views and legal repercussions have varied greatly in regards to senicide

Van Hoof writing in 1990 examines 87 reports of older people in classical antiquity who have committed suicide Of these suicides he claims 20 were motivated by impatience 17 by humiliation 12 by vanity and ten by suffering Van Hoof also provides statistics for the manner of the suicide both successful and unsuccessful Starvation was the most widely used accounting for 18 of the 61 cases available Suicide via the use of weapons was second most prevalent making up 13 cases followed by the use of poison in 11 cases The use of various methods seven different methods are reported in all suggests that no particular technique was believed to be the most proper or entirely condemned However that Athens had a law focusing on suicide by hanging indicates that this manner of suicide was especially disdained perhaps because the death was intimately connected with a structure that could not be easily removed such as a tree Thus the act of purification should it be deemed necessary would be more difficult to perform
Ancient philosophical thoughts varied greatly in this respect Plato bifurcates suicide in Laws although killing oneself out of grief misfortune or state injunction is acceptable to commit suicide owing to sloth and unmanly cowardice requires purification rituals and demands that the body be buried without an epitaph

Aristotle viewed suicide as an unjust act when a man in violation of the law harms another otherwise than in retaliation voluntarily he acts unjustly Thus for a man to harm himself Aristotle reasons is an unjust act

Pythagorean doctrine held that all creatures were being punished by the gods who imprisoned the creatures souls in a body Thus any attempt to alter this punishment would be seen as a direct violation of the gods wills In the fourth century BC the Hippocratic Oath was developed and reads I will not give a fatal draught to anyone if I am asked nor will I suggest any such thing Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath euthanasia by means of a fatal draught was forbidden However one of the most famous examples of deviation from this code occurred when the physician of Seneca a philosopher and tutor of Nero provided the scholar who was 69 years old at the time with poison for one of his many failed attempts at suicide

The societies of antiquity viewed suicide and euthanasia very differently from modern culture Although factors such as better medical and psychological insight have affected contemporary societys view of suicide and euthanasia much of the shift in opinion of these forms of death occurred because of the change in religionthat is GrecoRoman society was dominated by pagan religions that did not categorically condemn suicide and euthanasia

Many modern Christians do not accept the practice of suicide or senicide holding that only God should have control over a persons life and death

The Heruli were a Germanic tribe during the Migration Period about 400 to 800 CE Procopius states in his work The Wars that the Heruli placed the sick and elderly on a tall stack of wood and stabbed them to death before setting the pyre alight

In the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu the illegal practice of senicide  known locally as thalaikoothal  is said to occur dozens or perhaps hundreds of times each year

A common belief is that the Inuit would leave their elderly on the ice to die Senicide among the Inuit people was rare except during famines The last known case of an Inuit senicide was in 1939

Ubasute  abandoning an old woman a custom allegedly performed in Japan in the distant past whereby an infirm or elderly relative was carried to a mountain or some other remote desolate place and left there to die This custom has been vividly depicted in The Ballad of Narayama a 1956 novel by Shichir Fukazawa a 1958 film and a 1983 film

In Nordic folklore the ttestupa is a cliff where elderly people were said to leap or be thrown to death While the practice has no historical evidence the trope has survived as an urban legend and a metaphor for deficient welfare for the elderly

Senicide as an institutionalized practice however seems to be much less common in ancient Rome and Greece Parkin provides eighteen cases of senicide which the people of antiquity believed to happen Of these cases only two of them occur within Greek society one within Roman society and the rest falling outside of these two cultures One example that Parkin provides is of the island of Keos in the Aegean Sea Although many different variations of the Keian story exist the legendary practice may have begun when the Athenians besieged the island In an attempt to preserve the food supply the Keians voted for all people over 60 years of age to commit suicide by drinking hemlock The other case of Roman senicide occurred on the island of Sardinia where human sacrifices of 70yearsold fathers were made by their sons to the titan Cronus

The case of institutionalized senicide occurring in Rome comes from a proverb stating that 60yearolds were to be thrown from the bridge Whether or not this act occurred in reality was highly disputed in antiquity and continues to be doubted today The most comprehensive explanation of the tradition comes from Festus writing in the fourth century AD who provides several different beliefs of the origin of the act including human sacrifice by ancient Roman natives a Herculean association and the notion that older men should not vote because they no longer provided a duty to the state This idea to throw older men into the river probably coincides with the last explanation given by Festus That is younger men did not want the older generations to overshadow their wishes and ambitions and therefore suggested that the old men should be thrown off the bridge where voting took place and not be allowed to vote
Works of fiction which have dealt with senicide include

Pilate stone
The Pilate stone is a damaged block 82cm x 65cm of carved limestone with a partially intact inscription attributed to and mentioning Pontius Pilate a prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 26 to 36 It was discovered at the archaeological site of Caesarea Maritima in 1961 The artifact is particularly significant because it is an archaeological find of an authentic 1stcentury Roman inscription mentioning the name Pontius Pilatus It is contemporary to Pilates lifetime and accords with what is known of his reported career In effect the writing constitutes the earliest surviving record and a contemporaneous evidence for the historical existence of this person otherwise known from the New Testament and brief mentions in retrospective Roman histories which have themselves survived in stilllater copies

It is likely that Pontius Pilate made his base at Caesarea Maritima a city that had replaced Jerusalem since AD 6 as the administrative capital and military headquarters of the province and the site where the stone was discovered Pilate probably travelled to Jerusalem the central city of the provinces Jewish population only as often as necessary

The Pilate stone is currently located at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem Replica castings can be found at the Archaeological Museum in Milan Italy and on display in Caesarea Maritima itself

On the partially damaged block is a dedication to the deified Augustus and Livia the Divine Augusti the stepfather and mother of emperor Tiberius originally placed within a Tiberieum probably a temple dedicated to Tiberius It has been deemed authentic because it was discovered in the coastal town of Caesarea which was the capital of Iudaea Province during the time Pontius Pilate was Roman governor

The partial inscription reads conjectural letters in brackets

The translation from Latin to English for the inscription reads

The limestone block was discovered in June 1961 by Italian archaeologists led by Dr Antonio Frova while excavating in the area of an ancient theatre built by decree of Herod the Great around 2210 BC along with the entire city of Caesarea

The artifact is a fragment of the dedicatory inscription of a later building probably a temple that was constructed possibly in honour of the emperor Tiberius dating to 2636 AD

The stone was then reused in the 4th century as a building block for a set of stairs belonging to a structure erected behind the stage house of the Herodian theatre and it was discovered there still attached to the ancient staircase by the archaeologists The theatre is located in a town that was called Caesarea Maritima in the presentday city of CaesareaontheSea also called Maritima

The Ein Yaakov is the only work Ibn abib left to the world The object of the author was to familiarize the public with the ethical spirit of Talmudic literature at the same time his notes were intended to refute the charges brought against the Talmud by the numerous Spanish converts The book which thus appealed to the mass of the unlearned became very popular It was often edited and annotated and served as a textbook of religious instruction There are over thirty editions known the latest as of 1906 Vilna 1883 contains twenty commentaries among them one which consists of selections from more than one hundred homiletic works Of the additions the most important one is that of Leone di Modena under the title HaBoneh which has appeared in all editions since 1684 The authors intention was chiefly to propagate a more rationalistic view of the Talmudic Aggadah In some editions the title of the whole work is Ein Yisrael

Founding Brothers
Founding Brothers The Revolutionary Generation is a Pulitzer Prizewinning book written by Joseph Ellis a professor of history at Mount Holyoke College which won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for History It explores selected interactions among a group of individuals both gifted and flawed interactions that profoundly influenced the early development of the United States

Ellis constructed his book by assessing certain events during the decade following the 1787 Constitutional Convention

He chooses to do this not in any systematic or comprehensive manner but by focusing on a halfdozen political personages John Adams Thomas Jefferson George Washington James Madison Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr and a handful of revealing episodes that would test their convictions and friendships

He notes that Ellis borrowed his technique from Lytton Stracheys classic study Eminent Victorians about notable English figures



Joyce Appleby of the Washington Post Book World commented that In lesser hands the fractious disputes and hysterical rhetoric of these contentious nationbuilders might come across as hyperbolic pettiness Ellis knows better and he unpacks the real issues for his readers revealing the driving assumptions and riveting fears that animated Americans first encounter with the organized ideologies and interests we call parties 

In 2002 The History Channel produced a threeandahalf hour documentary covering the various topics of the book
In 2011 Ellis coauthored a screen statement with a former student Daliah Leslie in an effort to make a feature film adaptation The treatment was based on one chapter of the award winning book entitled The Duel

Friedrich Karl Forberg 30 August 1770 Meuselwitz  1 January 1848 Hildburghausen was a German philosopher and classical scholar

He studied under Karl Leonhard Reinhold at Jena In 1791 he travelled to Klagenfurt writing to Reinhold that there was much sympathy for the French Revolution and to the followers of Immanuel Kant that the young ladies of Klagenfurt substituted Kants writings modestly bound in black for their prayer books

He was a headmaster at SaalfeldSaale and from 1801 to 1826 Director of the Schsische Landesbibliothek His philosophical publications are less known now than his 1824 edition of an erotic poem sequence in renaissance Latin Hermaphroditus by Antonio Beccadelli This was accompanied by Forbergs own learned commentary which took the form of a catalogue and anthology of descriptions of sexual acts and postures in classical and later literature

Forbergs journal article regarding religion and its effect on morality initiated the Atheism Dispute which resulted in Johann Gottlieb Fichtes dismissal from his professorship

Induced path
In the mathematical area of graph theory an induced path in an undirected graph G is a path that is an induced subgraph of G That is it is a sequence of vertices in G such that each two adjacent vertices in the sequence are connected by an edge in G and each two nonadjacent vertices in the sequence are not connected by any edge in G An induced path is sometimes called a snake and the problem of finding long induced paths in hypercube graphs is known as the snakeinthebox problem

Similarly an induced cycle is a cycle that is an induced subgraph of G induced cycles are also called chordless cycles or when the length of the cycle is four or more holes An antihole is a hole in the complement of G ie an antihole is a complement of a hole

The length of the longest induced path in a graph has sometimes been called the detour number of the graph for sparse graphs having bounded detour number is equivalent to having bounded treedepth The induced path number of a graph G is the smallest number of induced paths into which the vertices of the graph may be partitioned and the closely related path cover number of G is the smallest number of induced paths that together include all vertices of G The girth of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle but this cycle must be an induced cycle as any chord could be used to produce a shorter cycle for similar reasons the odd girth of a graph is also the length of its shortest odd induced cycle

The illustration shows a cube a graph with eight vertices and twelve edges and an induced path of length four in this graph A straightforward case analysis shows that there can be no longer induced path in the cube although it has an induced cycle of length six The problem of finding the longest induced path or cycle in a hypercube first posed by  is known as the snakeinthebox problem and it has been studied extensively due to its applications in coding theory and engineering

Many important graph families can be characterized in terms of the induced paths or cycles of the graphs in the family


It is NPcomplete to determine for a graph G and parameter k whether the graph has an induced path of length at least k credit this result to an unpublished communication of Mihalis Yannakakis However this problem can be solved in polynomial time for certain graph families such as asteroidaltriplefree graphs or graphs with no long holes

It is also NPcomplete to determine whether the vertices of a graph can be partitioned into two induced paths or two induced cycles As a consequence determining the induced path number of a graph is NPhard

The complexity of approximating the longest induced path or cycle problems can be related to that of finding large independent sets in graphs by the following reduction From any graph G with n vertices form another graph H with twice as many vertices as G by adding to G nn12 vertices having two neighbors each one for each pair of vertices in G Then if G has an independent set of size k H must have an induced path and an induced cycle of length 2k formed by alternating vertices of the independent set in G with vertices of I Conversely if H has an induced path or cycle of length k any maximal set of nonadjacent vertices in G from this path or cycle forms an independent set in G of size at least k3 Thus the size of the maximum independent set in G is within a constant factor of the size of the longest induced path and the longest induced cycle in H Therefore by the results of on inapproximability of independent sets unless NPZPP there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm for approximating the longest induced path or the longest induced cycle to within a factor of On of the optimal solution

Holes and antiholes in graphs without chordless cycles of length 5 in a graph with n vertices and m edges may be detected in time nm

Atomic cycles are a generalization of chordless cycles that contain no nchords Given some cycle an nchord is defined as a path of length n connecting two points on the cycle where n is less than the length of the shortest path on the cycle connecting those points If a cycle has no nchords it is called an atomic cycle because it cannot be decomposed into smaller cycles
In the worst case the atomic cycles in a graph can be enumerated in Om time where m is the number of edges in the graph

Samuel Wadsworth Russell House
The Samuel Wadsworth Russell House is a historic house at 350 High Street in Middletown Connecticut It was built in 1828 to a design by architect Ithiel Town and is described as one of the finest Greek Revival mansions in the northeastern United States It is further notable for Towns client Samuel Wadsworth Russell 17891862 the founder of Russell  Company the largest and most important American firm to do business in the China trade in the 19th century In 1970 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001 It is now owned by Wesleyan University and houses the Department of Philosophy

This building was erected in 1828 for Samuel Russell 17891862 Russell founded the trading firm of Russell  Company in Canton China after serving there as trading representative of the Providence Rhode Island firm of Edward Carrington  Company Between 1818 and 1831 Russells fortune was made in the illegal yet highly profitable importation of Turkish and Bengal opium into the port of Canton and the exportation of fine teas and silks from there to Europe and the United States In 1828 when his house was built Russell was in Canton and his friend Samuel D Hubbard worked with Mrs Russell to supervise the building of the house In 1831 Russell returned to Middletown and his new home where he resided until his death in 1862

The Russell House was designed by Ithiel Town one of the periods foremost architects and major proponent of the Greek Revival style in America David Hoadley of Curtis and Hoadley a prominent New Haven builderarchitect superintended the construction The house has the form of a Greek temple with six full height Corinthian columns supporting a heavy entablature and low flushboarded pediment The front west wall has five bays with recessed panels between the first and second story windows except in the center bay where pilasters support a high entablature over the double entrance door This doorway is surrounded by side and overlights whose frames are decorated with fretwork The windows on the twobay side facades are separated vertically by panels like those on the front Stucco scribed to resemble large block ashlar covers the brick masonry walls The house has a brownstone foundation supported by load bearing masonry walls and a gable roof

An antemion decorative motif is used on the portico column capitals front corner pilasters and in the attic window screen covers The heavy entablature has three bands in the architrave a band of foliated molding under the plain frieze and a denticulated cornice defined by a bead and reel molding and an elaborate crown molding Around 1855 the rear portico was enclosed and is now divided by six pilasters originally square pillars into five bays of windows with small protruding balconies in the end bays A twostory north wing added around 1855 is attributed to Alexander Jackson Davis a former partner of Ithiel Town Although not consistent with the symmetry of the whole it is treated sympathetically through the use of identical pilasters and entablature

The Russell estate occupied all of the block bounded by High Court Pearl and Washington Streets Extensive grounds behind Russell House sloping down to Pearl Street were planted with formal gardens which included boxwood imported from England and plants brought from China by Samuel Russell A double stair of intricate ironwork was added to the rear of the house at the time the portico was enclosed It leads from the first floor down to the garden lawn

The interior is divided by a spacious center hall with two rooms on either side A stairway with landing is at the end of the hall The four chimney stacks are placed in the outside wall of each of the rooms off the hall The south parlors communicate through a set of folding doors while the original north rooms have been opened up to provide a single large space

Close attention to detail characterizes the decorative treatment throughout the interior Trompe loeil wall paintings simulate panelling on the walls of the north main rooms entrance hall and stairwell Similarly elaborate decoration is seen in the marble fireplaces with Ionic columns supporting the mantelpieces and in the recessed panelling of the doors and folding window shutters A wide frieze and heavy cornice of decorative plaster define the high ceilings of the interior

The Russell House represents a significant stage in the development of Greek Revival architecture in America In his work Town and Davis Architects Roger Hale Newton mentions the Russell House as indicative of the hand of Town in its undeniable sophistication Professor Talbot Hamlin places its design in the richest Greek vein and also states that its Corinthian columns and open plan are urban and magnificent rather than in the simple old tradition Newton elaborates on the latter point when he states that the communicating suite of parlors with their grand scale may have reflected an urban development quite contrary to the prevailing modern provincial places The Russell House demonstrates an early attempt by Ithiel Town to match the sophisticated design of an imposing Greek temple form with a compatible interior plan suited to living and entertaining on a grand scale This plan was used in Town and Davis later work in New York and its successful application to the temple form provided a basis for vernacular interpretations of the Greek Revival style which dominated residential construction until the advent of picturesque architecture

The construction of the Russell House in 1828 established a standard of luxury and elegance for the residential architecture on High Street during the 19th and early 20th centuries Although many other imposing homes were built in this area of Middletown the Russell House was never surpassed in sophistication and grandeur It stands a monument to the personal qualities of Samuel Russell and to the exciting era of the China trade when Russell carried Middletowns mercantile tradition to its greatest heights

The mansion faces west from the southeast corner of High and Washington Streets The large scale of execution and the imposing qualities of the architecture enable this building to dominate the surrounding area High Street during the 19th and early 20th centuries was the most prestigious residential area in Middletown It is now part of the campus of Wesleyan University

After remaining in the Russell family for five generations the house was deeded to Wesleyan in 1937 by Thomas Macdonough Russell Jr It was known as Honors College until 1996 The building is currently being used as an events facility and home to the Universitys Philosophy department

Saint Florentina
Saint Florentina died ca 612 is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church Born towards the middle of the sixth century in Cartagena Hispania she and her family were actively engaged in furthering the best interests of Christianity

Florentina was the sister of three Iberian bishops in the time of the Visigothic dominion Leander Isidore of Seville and Fulgentius she consecrated her virginity to God and all four have been canonized by the Church

She was younger than her brother Leander later Archbishop of Seville but older than Isidore who succeeded Leander as archbishop of the same see

Before his elevation to the episcopal dignity Leander had been a monk and it was through his influence that Florentina embraced the ascetic life She associated with herself a number of virgins who also desired to forsake the world and formed them into a religious community Later sources declare their residence to have been the convent of S Maria de Valle near Ecija Astigis of which city her brother Fulgentius was bishop

In any case it is certain that she had been consecrated to God before the year 600 as her brother Leander who died either in the year 600 or 601 wrote for her guidance an extant work dealing with a nuns rule of life and with contempt for the world Regula sive Libellus de institutione virginum et de contemptu mundi ad Florentinam sororem PL LXXII 873 sqq In it the author lays down the rules according to which cloistered consecrated virgins should regulate their lives He strongly advises them to avoid interaction with women living in the world and with men especially youths recommends strict temperance in eating and drinking gives advice concerning the reading of and meditation on Holy Scripture enjoins equal love and friendship for all those living together in community and exhorts his sister earnestly to remain true to her holy state

Florentina regulated her life according to the advice of her brother entered with fervour into the spirit of the religious life and was honoured as a saint after her death Her younger brother Isidore also dedicated to her his work De fide catholica contra Judos which he wrote at her request Florentina died early in the seventh century and is venerated as the patroness of the diocese of Plasencia Her feast falls on 20 June The name is written Florentia in the Roman martyrology but Florentina is without doubt the correct form

An important part of her bones was buried in the cathedral of Murcia Spain where are venerated nowadays However the biggest part of her remains are preserved in Berzocana Spain where she is venerated as well as her brother Fulgentius

<doc id="7714448" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7714448" title="Glasgow Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway">
Glasgow Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway
The Glasgow Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Railway was a railway jointly owned by the Caledonian Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway completed in 1873 and giving the latter a shorter access to its Carlisle main line A branch to Beith was also built

It was formed by extending the earlier independent Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway which is also described here that line was taken over by the joint company

The main line between Glasgow and Kilmarnock continues in operation at the present day The station at Neilston was closed and the locality is served by a different line

The Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway GBNDR was authorised on 4 August 1845 to build its line of nine miles 15km with a capital of 150000 It was to run from a terminal on the south side of Glasgow to Crofthead near Neilston The location was the centre of several local industries in the valley of the Cowdon Burn on the Ayr Road below Neilston

Two short branches to Thornliebank and to Househill were authorised in the following year with an additional 35000 capital

The Glasgow terminal was somewhat remote from the cityGlasgow Bridge carried a toll at this timebut a small railway company could ill afford a central terminus

Many early railways had been simply a means to move coal and other heavy minerals from a pit to a waterway By the 1840s it was evident that they had a more strategic role and in 1846 a Royal Commission deliberated on the desirable location of passenger and goods terminals to serve the city of Glasgow and the quays on the Clyde

The Caledonian Railway CR had just been authorised in 1845 and planned to get access to the city over the route of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway by now transformed into the Glasgow Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway which terminated at Townhead in the northeast margin of the city Taking a strategic view the CR hoped to get authorisation for a more central terminal and it collaborate with the GBNDR to promote a passenger terminal in the city centre Together they proposed the Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway which would be located near St Enochs Square crossing the Clyde near Glasgow Bridge It got as far as an authorising Act of Parliament on 16 July 1846 but the details were left subject to approval by various authorities In fact the Admiralty demanded a swing bridge for the Clyde crossing and combined with other opposition the scheme faced too much obstruction and was reduced to the construction of a terminal station called South Side in the angle of Pollokshaws Road and Cathcart Street

The Glasgow Southern Terminal Railway was absorbed by the GBNDR by Act of Parliament of 2 July 1847 which also authorised a deviation of the route The CR also obtained authority to lease the GBNDR line

At this period the Ardrossan Railway had grand plans to reach Glasgow from Ardrossan where the 12th Earl of Eglinton had expended considerable sums improving the harbour the Ardrossan Railway was largely sponsored by him Its natural enemy was the Glasgow Paisley Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway GPKAR which was building in that part of Ayrshire and the Ardrossan company had purchased large quantities of GBNDR shares to stop the Glasgow and Ayr swamping it If the Ardrossan company was hostile to the GPKAR then the Caledonian was a friend of the Ardrossan A physical link between the GBNDR and the Ardrossan company had been suggested and the Caledonian calculated that possession of the GBNDR would give it access to much of Ayrshire beating off the GPKAR In 1846 the Ardrossan Company had obtained Parliamentary authority to build a line from Crofthead intended terminus of the GBNDR and Kilwinning and Kilmarnock

The GBNDR opened its line as far a Barrhead terminus on 27 September 1848 the station was in the Grahamston district below the town and on the northwest side of the Water of Levern The Glasgow station was South Side

The 1847 Act had merely authorised the lease by the Caledonian the terms had to be negotiated and these were being finalised by a further Act of 1 August 1849 by which time the CR had succeeded in reducing its financial commitment to the original GBNDR shareholders even so the outlay was 16500 on a 999year lease receipts were barely enough to cover the working costs

On 1 June 1849 the Clydesdale Junction Railway CJR was completed terminating at South Side station The CJR was effectively under the control of the Caledonian Railway and trains to and from England now used the station From 10 September 1849 trains from the Hamilton line also used the station In that year the station was rebuilt to a design of William Tite although cramped the facade was imposing

In 1865 the GSWR promoted a Bill to build a line from Kilmarnock to Glasgow via Stewartonthe direct route which the citizens of Kilmarnock had wanted from the GBKAR at the outset The Caledonian responded with a Bill to extend the Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway which they leased and worked from Crofthead ie Neilston to Kilmarnock Both these schemes obtained Parliamentary authority The lines would be closely parallel and at this time the respective shareholders strenuously made it clear that the duplicate expenditure was wasteful

At first the compromise was that the two routes would converge at Stewarton continuing as a single route to the GSWR station at Kilmarnock In fact the proposals were held in suspense for some time until in the 1869 session a Bill was put forward merging the schemes entirely the rival companies agreed to build the line jointly from Crofthead to Kilmarnock This was authorised by a fresh Act of Parliament on 12 July 1869 which cancelled the two earlier Acts The line was to be called the Glasgow Barrhead and Kilmarnock Joint Line The GSWR had already constructed a short length northwards from Kilmarnock and now extended that to make an end on junction with the GBNDR line at Neilston By then a new station had been opened at Neilston on 27 March 1871 forming the temporary southern extremity of the GBNDR line

The line between Barrhead and Neilston was closed temporarily from 1 May 1870 to enable the doubling of the line the new Neilston station was located a short distance on the Kilmarnock side of the former location

The 1869 Act had authorised building a short connecting line from near South Side to the City of Glasgow Union Railway which had been authorised in 1863 so as to enable GSWR trains on the Kilmarnock line to reach the planned St Enoch passenger and College goods terminals The Act included a clause imposing a penalty of 60000 if the through line were not ready by 28 June 1872

In fact the deadline was not met the line was opened only as far as Stewarton on 27 March 1871 An Act of 25 July 1872 removed the penalty as well as clarifying the City Union line connection The through route was opened on 26 June 1873 As well as the line from Glasgow to Kilmarnock there was a branch to Beith from Barrmill opened on the same day However the Glasgow terminal remained the awkwardly located South Side station the connection towards St Enoch was not ready The former Glasgow Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway company was bought out

The new route was difficult to operate a veritable switchback with 3miles 5km of 1 in 6770 on Neilston bank

The GSWR discontinued its passenger service from South Side station towards Kilmarnock on 1 September 1877

While Glasgow commuting built up in the 1960s the outer limit of frequent passenger train services was Barrhead The Neilston station on the line was closed as the alternative line to Neilston High was electrified The East Kilbride line branching from the Kilmarnock line at Busby Junction assumed greater importance as the housing construction there developed

The track between Barrhead and Kilmarnock was singled as part of the rationalisation of the route in the mid 1970s following the electrification of the West Coast Main Line with a passing loop at Lugton However in 2009 the section between and Lugton was redoubled forming a dynamic loop as part of capacity improvements between Glasgow and Kilmarnock

The section from Strathbungo Junction to Cumberland Street Junction by which trains reached the City Union Line from 1873 was closed beyond Langside Junction in 1973 and lifted the remainder is still in use for freight

The line to Beith closed to passengers on 5 November 1962 and to freight two years later

In 1968 the severity of rationalisation was such that the line was to be closed and trains diverted via Paisley and Dalrythe original GPKAR route In the event this was not done and the Dalry  Kilmarnock route closed

The main line is open and carries 2015 a typically halfhourly passenger service running from Glasgow to Barrhead and then all stations to Kilmarnock in addition a halfhourly service runs from Glasgow Central to Barrhead calling at all stations There is a limited Sunday service

At Lugton there is a goodsonly branch line to Barrmill Munitions Depot however the rail facility is dormant The route uses the first part of the Beith branch as far as Barrmill then continuing on the former Lanarkshire and Ayrshire Railway route

John Thomas Blight
John Thomas Blight FSA 7 October 1835  23 January 1911 was a Cornish archaeological artist born near Redruth in Cornwall England UK

His father Robert a teacher moved the family to Penzance and introduced his sons to the study of nature antiquities and folk lore John Blight was a natural draughtsman By the age of 20 Blight had published a book on the antiquities of Penwith and a large collection of drawings

His expansion of this work in two volumes was at first encouraged by Rev R S Hawker and then the cause of a great quarrel John Blights second patron James Halliwell was similarly unhelpful never paying him for his vast labour in illustrating Halliwells projected edition of William Shakespeares Works

In the mid1860s Blight had a mental breakdown and was incarcerated for the remainder of his life in Bodmin Mental Asylum Blights recording of Cornish antiquities includes many that no longer exist His descriptions and illustrations of them provide a most valuable source for archaeologists and local historians

Diffuse element method
In numerical analysis the diffuse element method DEM or simply diffuse approximation is a meshfree method

The diffuse element method was developed by B Nayroles G Touzot and Pierre Villon at the Universite de Technologie de Compiegne in 1992
It is in concept rather similar to the much older smoothed particle hydrodynamics In the paper they describe a diffuse approximation method a method for function approximation from a given set of points
In fact the method boils down to the wellknown moving least squares for the particular case of a global approximation using all available data points Using this function approximation method partial differential equations and thus fluid dynamic problems can be solved For this they coined the term diffuse element method DEM
Advantages over finite element methods are that DEM doesnt rely on a grid and is more precise in the evaluation of the derivatives of the reconstructed functions

Scott Yanow reviewed the album for AllMusic and wrote that By 1988 68yearold Peggy Lee did not have much of a voice left Although she was still determined physical problems had weakened her and despite Gene Lees absurd raving in the liner notes Her work has never flagged the quality of it has never faltered this set finds her way past her prime Yanow described the material as pretty strong and praised the quintet that supported Lee on the album and concluded his review by writing that This is one of the better releases from Peggy Lees later years but it still pales next to her 1950s recordings

Locrians
The Locrians  Locri were an ancient Greek tribe that inhabited the region of Locris in Central Greece around Parnassus They spoke the Locrian dialect a DoricNorthwest dialect and were closely related to their neighbouring tribes the Phocians and the Dorians They were divided into two geographically distinct tribes the western Ozolians and the eastern Opuntians their primary towns were Amphissa and Opus respectively and their most important colony was the city of Epizephyrian Locris in Magna Graecia which still bears the name Locri Among others Ajax the Lesser and Patroclus were the most famous Locrian heroes both distinguished in the Trojan War Zaleucus from Epizephyrian Locris devised the first written Greek law code the Locrian code

In Greek mythology the Locrians were the descendants of Locrus greatgrandson of Deucalion and Pyrrha the founders of the Greek race According to some traditions Deucalion was a native of the Locrian city of Opus thus the Locrians are said to have been the first tribe to be called Hellenes Some ancient writers supposed the name of the Locrians to be derived from an ancient king of the Leleges the prehistoric residents of Locris named Locrus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus mention that Locrians is the later name of the Leleges in the way that many ancient writers inaccurately identified several Greek tribes with the aboriginal peoples of Greece

The Locrians are said to have arrived in southern Greece in the late 2nd millennium BC from their homeland on Pindus when the Greek tribes moved southwards In historical times the Locrians were divided into two distinct tribes differing from each other in customs habits and civilization Of these the eastern Locrians called the Opuntian and Epicnemedian dwelt on the eastern coast of Greece opposite the island of Euboea while the western Locrians called Ozolian or Esperian dwelt on the Corinthian gulf and were separated from the former by Mount Parnassus and the whole of Doris and Phocis

It is likely that Locrian territory once extended from sea to sea then was divided as a result of the immigration of the Phocians and Dorians The most famous colony of the Locrian tribe was the city of Epizephyrian Locri founded in the 7th century BC in Magna Grcia which exists until today as Locri According to Strabo the founders were the Ozolian Locrians from the region of Amphissa

In the 6th century BC the Locrians had a series of conflicts with the neighbouring tribes Only the Opuntian Locrians are mentioned by Homer they were the more ancient and the more civilized The Ozolian Locrians who are said to have been a colony of the former are not mentioned in history until the time of the Peloponnesian War and are even then represented as a semibarbarous people That was the last mention of the Ozolian Locrians as they suffered the defeat from Corinth later and they stopped having a distinct identity in the 4th century BC The Opuntian Locrians who are mentioned to have taken part in the battle of Thermopylae between the Greeks and the Persians were attacked by various tribes which devastated their country and only some of their towns preserved the Locrian identity in the 3rd century BC

The Locrians around Thermopylae were the first to have been called Hellenes Later the name expanded to include the other Greek tribes through the Amphictionia of Delphi to which they belonged and their religion The most famous of their heroes were Ajax the Locrian best known as Ajax the Lesser son of Oileus and Patroclus son of Menoetius and best friend of Achilles Elements of Ajax worship have been found in Euboea Pontus the Aegean islands Asia Minor Peloponnesus Kerkyra Epirus southern Italy and northern Africa which means that the Locrian civilization was widely extended in the ancient Greek world In Greek mythology the Locrians are closely related to the Phocians and Eleans

James M Redfield professor of Classics at the University of Chicago in his book The Locrian Maidens Love and Death in Greek Italy states that the Locrians of Epizephyrian Locri had a special way to treat the sex difference Although the Locrians hardly viewed men and women as equals women held special religious rights which men could gain access to only by marrying them Locrian women became the vehicles for the transmission of status and marriage maintained the social order of a traditional oligarchy

The national hero of the Locrians was Ajax the Locrian who led the 40 Locrian ships to Troy to take part in the Trojan War Locrians respected him so much that after his death they kept a place for him in their phalanx thinking that he will always fight with them On the other side Ajaxs actions resulted in his death according to Greek mythology while the Locrian tribe suffered from the anger of the gods After the fall of Troy he raped Cassandra in the temple of Athena where she had taken refuge as a supplicant For this crime Poseidon wrecked the ship of Ajax on the coast of Euboea and Ajax was killed by a lightning bolt

According to Lycophron in his work Alexandra for this crime of their national hero the Locrians had to send two unmarried maidens to the temple of Athena at Ilion of Athens for 1000 years where they should live until they died After their death they would not be given a decent burial while for each maiden who died another one must be sent into the temple by night and she would be stoned to death if seen 

The goddess is referred to as Athena Ilias a name not necessarily derived from Ilion but maybe from the family deity Oileus the father of Ajax and the ancestral hero of the Locrians She could have protected the maidens during their period of initiation

Callimachus mentions that the curse fell upon Locris three years after the Trojan war which led to the beginning of the tribute at the command of the Delphic oracle According to Apollodorus after the command of the Delphic oracle two maidens were sent to Ilion and their duty was to clean the temple After their death they were replaced while the tribute ended after a thousand years with the end of the Phocian War which destroyed Naryca the town that supplied the maidens Aelian says that the plague fell upon Locris after the Locrians failed to send the yearly tribute that the oracle demanded Demetrius of Scepsis knows that the maidens were sent for the first time when the Persians were already in control so after 547 BC 

Locrian maidens had the appearance of a Greek mourner as they went to Ilion barefoot wearing only one garment and their hair was loose or cut Cut hair symbolizes maturity for both sexes and plays a part in marriage rituals while loosened or cut hair are required in other cults such as to Demeter and Dionysus and bare feet in other as well In addition to these loosened hair and bare feet are signs of a witch 

These maidens were not given proper burials as most of them were burnt on a pyre of barren branches and the ashes were thrown to the sea This kind of pyre was used in Greece to burn criminals and the barren trees were used to burn portents and prodigies while criminals were hanged from these trees Locrian maidens were seen as marginal beings and scapegoats separated from normal life a feature of rites of passage The three stages of rites of passage are separation marginalization and reincorporation and according to this the maidens left for Ilion spent a year there and returned home In Epizephyrian Locri maidens were prostituted as a reminder and punishment for a certain act Ancient basis for prostitution was that girls would marry earlier than their coevals and foreigners would complete the rites The completion of the rites enhances the status of girls

In the middle of the 6th century this cult became more epic focused and centered on the expiation for the crimes of Ajax As a result later generations forgot its significance and put an end to this tribute but a Greek inscription discovered in Locris at the end of the nineteenth century proves that the Locrians continued to send out pairs of maidens until the 3rd century BC

Thierry Roussel
Thierry Roussel born February 16 1953 was the fourth husband of Christina Onassis and the only man with whom she had a child daughter Athina Onassis Roussel Roussel is best known as the controversial former cotrustee of his eldest childs famous fortune and for having been involved in a number of legal entanglements with the four Greek trustees of that fortune These disputes were mostly ended or quieted in 1999 by the courtordered transfer of the administration of Athinas trust to a private auditing firm

Thierry Patrick Franois Roussel was born on 16 February 1953 in NeuillysurSeine HautsdeSeine near Paris the son of the late Henry Julien Gaston Roussel who was President and General Manager of the Roussel Uclaf Laboratoires Pharmaceutiques and his wife Francine Grinda daughter of JeanPaul Grinda and niece of the French politician douard Grinda

Roussel graduated from high school in 1972 He studied economics at PanthonAssas University

He has two sisters Patricia Roussel and Christine Roussel the duchess of Luynes widow of Jean dAlbert 12th duc de Luynes His maternal uncles are the veteran Davis Cup tennis player JeanNol Grinda and Olivier Grinda The Roussel familys fortunes derive from the Roussel Uclaf pharmaceutical corporation most famous in the US for the design of the abortifacient RU486 mifepristone

Roussel married Christina Onassis in 1984 They had a honeymoon in the Caribbean but their marriage ended in divorce in 1987 Generally the story is reported the same way with the strong suggestion that theirs was a marriage based rather on convenience or infatuation than true love Whatever the truth there were certainly serious marital problems Roussel had at least one extramarital affair during the marriage with former Swedish model Marianne Gaby Landhage who gave birth to their elder two of three children while Roussel was still married to Christina In fact he has a son with Gaby who is only a few months younger than his daughter Athina by Christina For Christinas part she suffered from bouts of serious depression and allegedly selfmedicated herself with drugs and overeating In any case Christina and Roussel began divorce proceedings eight months after Athina was born

Roussel married Marianne Gaby Landhage in 1990 in the village church in Villeny near Bonneville the Roussels estate in Sologne Athina Roussel was a bridal attendant By then Athina was in her fathers custody Roussel and Gaby now have three children Erik Sandrine and Johanna The two older children were born during Roussels marriage to ChristinaErik in July 1985 and Sandrine in May 1987 Johanna was born in July 1991

He created his first company at the age of 22 and then created several publicity space rental companies AEA Supermdia and Mdia Center which were later resold to the Carat Group

In 1987 he decided to reside in Switzerland and created the financial management company SGFC where he continues to act as President at the present time

Christina Onassis never trusted Thierry Roussel completely which led the family to arrange for a Board of Administrators to control the familys money until Athina came of age The trustees Christina selected to manage Athinas estate in the event of Christinas death were Stelio Papadimitriou Paul Ioannidis Apostolos Zabelas Theodore Gabrielides and Thierry Roussel The four Greeks the board members other than Roussel were frequently dubbed in the media as the greybeards During Athinas childhood and adolescence all expenditures made on her behalf by her father using money from the Onassis inheritance had to be approved by the Board in advance which led her father to threaten constantly to move back to Paris France with the family where income taxes would cost the estate a small fortune a year as he put it In 1999 a Vaduz court ordered the management of Athinas inheritance transferred from the five trustees selected by her mother to the KPMG Fides auditing firm in Lucerne

In 2003 he created a Fund of Funds called GMT with the participation of numerous international banks

Roussel has sometimes been derided in the media for certain business decisions The most legendary one was the investment in strawberry farms in Portugal Some reports like the Athens News Agency in 1998 say the result was bankruptcy Diane Sawyer investigated the situation in doing research for her interview with Athina in 1998 and according to Sawyer although Roussel did not actually file for bankruptcy he did sell the strawberry farms at a loss According to Forbes it was a US 30 million loss

Roussel used his company Oderfruta to invest in the farms with a borrowed subsidy from the European Union which hoped that the company might create jobs and stimulate the economy in one of the poorest regions of Portugal Roussel additionally borrowed money from the Portuguese state and a bank but by 1994 the venture was badly debtridden

Roussel did not let the fiasco discourage him however Over the years he has had numerous business interests from a modeling agency in Paris boat building in Morocco and horse breeding The horse breeding company called European Horses naturally overlapped into his daughters Sandrines and Athinas passion for show jumping They rode his horses in competitions and Roussel was often photographed with them at those competitions

Manolo Caracol
Manuel Ortega Jurez 9 July 1909  24 February 1973 was a Spanish flamenco cantaor singer

Born in Seville Spain he was descended from a long line of flamenco artists including Enrique Ortega father and son and Curro Dulce and he was possibly related to and El Fillo The family was also known for its bull fighters

Under the stage name El Caracol he gained international fame as much for his flamboyant personality as for his extraordinary cante Later his juergas days long flamenco parties became notorious Although as a singer he always retained the ability to deliver the core of the traditional art he was not ashamed to commercialize flamenco to attract a mass popularity then he gained fame and fortune as well as adding to a checkered reputation For the most part this was during what was later widely known as a decadent age in the history of the art the age of pera flamenca

In 1922 as a youth he had been awarded the first prize shared with El Tenazas at the Concurso de Cante Jondo de Granada organized by intellectuals like Manuel de Falla and Federico Garca Lorca However in the first stage of his career he made a living singing mostly at private parties which at the time were together with cafs the usual stages for flamenco artists

During the Spanish Civil War 19361939 he started touring with theatre companies as owing to the war private parties were difficult to find This kind of theatre show very common at the time see pera flamenca was a musical with commonplace love stories set in Andalusian or gypsy context and their musical pieces were usually a mixture of Spanish popular song called copla andaluza or cancin espaola In 1943 he met Lola Flores with whom he started an intense professional and emotional relationship They became the most popular artistic couple in Spain during the forties spreading their fame even to several Spanish American countries His most popular songs in the field of copla andaluza which he used to call zambra date from that time songs like La salvaora and La nia de fuego became immensely famous in Spain He also took part in several films such as Un caballero famoso 1942 Embrujo 1946 Jack el Negro 1950 and La nia de la venta 1950

Although sometimes criticized by a very orthodox section of the flamenco public mainly because of his facet as a singer of copla andaluza a style which purists consider spurious but also because of the irregularity of his performances he is usually considered as one of the singers that better represent Duende a typical flamenco term which basically means inspiration He possessed a deep earthy yet warm voice and delivered the flamenco cantes songs with passion originality and extremely personal phrasing He excelled in a wide variety of flamenco styles including Martinetes Seguiriyas Sole Malagueas especially in the style of el Mellizo Buleras and Fandangos among others His renderings of Fandangos in particular were so personal that they have come to be known as Fandangos Caracoleros

Caracol died in a road accident in Madrid Spain

lvarez Caballero Its true that Manolo Caracol could sink to the lowest levels real slumps in which his singing was just a parody of itself but this often happens to cantaores of his type who are motivated by emotional impulse and the knowing flamenco fan knows that this can happen From a regular singer like Mairena we can expect he will always sing well From somebody like Caracol  you could expect anything either he was a disaster or he was an absolute genius ngel lvarez Caballero El cante flamenco 1998

Anselmo Gonzlez Climent With Caracol it is impossible to remain emotionally detached  from the first line since the temple itself he starts running through our sensibility and invades us thoroughly He forces us to take part until our egos are suppressed quoted by lvarez Caballero in La discografa ideal del flamenco 1995

Ricardo Molina about Caracols anthology Una historia del cante flamenco From the caa to the group of Malagueas flamenco style this anthology is an evil personification of Caracol messing up the definite forms of the past quoted by lvarez Caballero in La discografa ideal del flamenco 1995

As happens with most flamenco artists of the past Caracols discography is in complete disorder His recordings are regularly republished but in different compilations sometimes in careless remasterizations by different record companies

Una historia del cante flamenco originally published by Hispavox in 1958 with guitarist Melchor de Marchena remains his most seminal work It was republished together with other recordings in the compilation El genio Manolo Caracol in the Quejo CD collection published by Hispavox and compiled by JM Gamboa  This recording excludes his zambras For other recordings available see links below

Raymond then collected 15600 from the New Hampshire Republican State Committee and paid a small Idaho telemarketing company 2300 to make nonstop hangup phone calls to six New Hampshire phone lines five of which were being used by the Democratic Party to get out the vote The sixth phone line belonged to the Manchester Firefighters Union which offers free rides to the polls

Muthiri kinaru
Muthiri Kinaru Tamil   is the sacred well located in the northwestern corner of Swamithoppe village This is the famous theertha of the temple It is located half a kilometre west from the main Pathi 

Historically this well plays a major role in joining the people in this part of the country breaking the castebased discrimination that once prevailed among them Before and during the period of Lord Vaikundar this part of the subcontinent was under the grip of feudalism casteism and untouchability There were separate wells and tanks for each caste and people from the other caste were not allowed to draw out water from those wells As in the Vinchai since the social aim of uplifting the lowely treated people in the society occupies a major part in the spiritual mission of Vaikundar which is projected towards the ideal Dharma Yukam he wanted to stop this evil practice So as the first step to reach this aim this well was established at Swamithoppe Apart from religious sacredness this well was also a historical icon since it was the first well in this part of the country where people could use water freely irrespective of their caste

By the completion of the Sixyear Tavam of Vaikundar in 1840 the Thuvayal Thavasu practiced at Vakaippathi and Muttappathi for about one year as they reached Swamithoppe Several ritual practices of Ayyavazhi originated from this Some especially the prayers were continued as followed during the Thuvayal Thavasu period and some were originated as per the instructions of Vaikundar 

In that series Akilathirattu speaks of that well as the eighteen castes assembling in one place and bathing from the same well This refers to the prevalence of a seemingly innocuous practice of the people gathered around Vaikundar bathing together from the water of this well People of different castes bathed together at this well mindless of their social differences Physical closeness was necessitated mainly because of the smallness of the well Besides bathing they drank this water as cure for their illness They cooked their food with the use of this water and eat in community feast along with Vaikundar 

In the course of events the well and its water seem to have acquired religious significance to the people of Ayyavazhi The act of bathing drinking and cooking the food with this water came to be repeated with a ritual fervour People began to consider the well a sacred one and the water as having miraculous powers to heal sickness A couplet from the Saattu Neettolai of Arul Nool reads as every one is drinking the milk of the well around which miracles are growing And by this quote it seems that Akilam itself accredits the well as a sacred one People consider it a religious obligation to bathe and drink at least a few drops of water from this well 

Many people and multiple castes congregated there to draw water for bathing and drinking Lord Vaikuntar used the holy water from the well and the holy mud to cure the people of their illness

In the then Travancore society the discriminatory laws of purity and pollution were very sensitive in places of bathing and in acts involving the use of water Demarcation of separate places for the different castes for bathing and drawing water and a strict enforcement of this discriminated separation through regulations social and political along with a strong religious sanction was the order of the day As a general custom the lower castes were prohibited from drawing water from public wells and ponds The upper caste people had separate wells so that they could avoid the presence and pollution of the lower caste people Those who be it a member of the caste fold or one from outside of it ventured to transgress these demarcated spaces were penalised with severe corporal punishments or even eliminated unceremoniously 

It was against this back ground that a ritual involving the congregation of the people from different castes around a well bathing together and cooking their food with the water of the same well was being performed at Swamithoppe where Ayya Vaikundar was carrying out his mission It was an indirect challenge to the evil system of untouchability This cluster of ritual actions set in motion an interrogation of the system of purity and pollution and indirectly challenged the hegemonic system of discriminated separation The ritual boundaries that had been set on the use of water was sought to be transgressed and the strength of the traditional indoctrination on ritual impurity implied in the exchange of water from one to another was sought to be weakened

Due to the attention focused on the well maliscious acts have been recorded where poison was twice placed into the water by some antiayyavazhi elements One was during the period of Vaikundar and was noted in Akilam and another was in a recent time 

It is reported that Lord Vaikundar concentrated the poison into a Sivalinga and the Sivalinga remained inside the well in the first poisoning 

As per Akilam People hearing about the poisoning reported it to Vaikundar and requested him to save them Vaikundar informed the devotees that the water in the well was nonpoisonous People who had faith in his words drank and bathed in the well and were totally safe Those who had no belief in his words and had drunk the water became unconscious People rushed to the Lord and narrated the incident Lord asked them to sprinkle the holy water on those who were unconscious They got up as if from sleep 

Then on 17 September 1994 the first Sunday of the Tamil Month Puratasi poison was mixed up in the sacred water of Muthirikkinaru for the second time 

Some miscreants immersed a 5kilogram packet of Phorate a highly poisonous chemical into the well There was a smell of this chemical everywhere around the well Some advised the devotees not to bathe in the well But nobody heeded it thousands of people bathed in and drank the water Even sixmonthold babies were bathed here but nobody was affected The empty packet of the chemical was later retrieved and destroyed

This well is treated with more importance because it is attached to the incarnational activities of Vaikundar To overcome the three diversities Anava Kanma and Maya one should achieve spiritual cleanliness and it is believed that this cleanliness is obtained when one bathes from this sacred well This well is said to be sealed by Vaikundar and will remain as an icon for the destruction of Kali

Even today the well is too crowded to bathe People drink this water as Patham It is believed that the holy water from this well will process one for the life of Dharma Yukam It is also believed that lunatics and patients having no cure even after prolonged medical treatment and a stay in the temple can take a bath in muthirikinaru and be cured 

The Muthirikkinaru is addressed in Akilam as Muthal Thalam the primary place in ritual importance The Payyans start their daily routine only after the religious bathing in this well After the ceremonial bath they used to drink the sacred water Patham of the Muthirikkinaru for five times and give it so for the followers for five times Then the Payyan circumambulate the Muthirikkinaru for five times and others follow him Chanting Ayya Sivasiva Sivasiva Arahara Arahara all proceed to the Pathi This is practiced thrice a day during the morning noon and evening Panividais 

Also one of the important ritual actions performed by the devotees of Ayyavazhi is to take this ritual bath drawing water from the well This has become a ritual necessity to be gone through before one worships at the Pathi It is overwhelming to see the devotees throng the well to get a few buckets of water on to them and drink a few drops ceremoniously for five times and then proceed to the Pathi This practice of bathing at the well is being addressed as Patham viduthal 

Apart from this daily ritual this Muthirikkinaru earns a religious significance during the eighth day of the Kodiyettru Thirunal festival At that day Lord Vaikundar is carried to muthirikinaru on a horse vahana It is believed that the God hunts kali The ceremonial hunting of kali is done with a bow and arrow Here thousands of people assemble to drink the holy patham Patham viduthal is the word used by the devotees for bathing in Muthirikinaru There is a heavy rush to take a bath in the well on the first Sunday of the Tamil months 

Arul Nool the secondary holy book advises to do Dharma near this well

During the Car festivals and during the Ayya Vaikunda Avataram celebrations the worshippers are not allowed to draw water from Muthirikkinaru due to the limited size of the well and extent of the crowds that attend to worship During those days one or two Panividaiyalars are used to draw water from the well and to throw it onto the crowd In this way the everyone in the crowd gets a few drops poured on their heads

Carney was finally apprehended after the fall of the Berlin Wall by special agents of the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations AFOSI on April 22 1991Pintschstrasse 12in the Friedrichshain district of Berlin

Carney entered the US Air Force in December 1980 From April 1982 to April 1984 he was assigned to the 6912th Electronic Security Group Electronic Security Command at Tempelhof Central Airport in Berlin as a linguist and intelligence specialist with duty station at the 6912th Marienfelde Field Site

In the ZDF film Informationen um jeden Preis Carney admitted his homosexuality was the primary reason he became a spy Carney quickly became disillusioned with the Air Force and its intelligence gathering operations and there are several stories of him attempting to turn in his badge and quit in protest His firsthand experiences during the NATO exercise Able Archer 83 strengthened his resolve to help avoid a nuclear conflict Later lonely alienated and under psychological stress and he felt he had no one to talk to about his problems He had intended to defect to East Germany on his first crossing but he allowed himself to be drawn into espionage by East German intelligence agents who expertly manipulated him and claimed his complete loyalty

While working at the Marienfelde Field Site in Berlin Carney began copying classified documents which he then provided to the Stasi by repeatedly crossing back and forth into East Germany In 1984 he was involuntarily transferred to Goodfellow Air Force Base in Texas to work as a technical instructor Carney believed Goodfellow was a training base with no realworld intelligence of any interest to the Stasi He soon discovered that he had been wrong Carney continued providing the Stasi with documents meeting his handlers in Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro in 1985 Feeling cut off from his supervisors in East Berlin and at increasing risk in what became known as The Year of the Spy he sought out the protection of the East German embassy in Mexico City From there he was flown to Havana with the assistance of the Cuban government Weeks later he returned to East Berlin via Prague There he continued to work for Stasi HVA Abt XI and HA III by intercepting and translating nonsecure telephone communications of US military commanders as well as the East German telephone lines dedicated to the US embassy in East Berlin

During the course of his spying Carney provided Stasi and other Eastern Bloc intelligence services with more than one hundred topsecret US military documents For his services to East Germany he was awarded the NVA service medal in bronze and the medal of Waffenbrderschaft Brotherhood in Arms in gold His internal Stasi file shows the value of the work he performed for the Stasi and the KGB earning praise from KGB General Chebrikov as well as from General Zaitsev of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany GSFG

A break in the case came after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 when many Stasi records became available to foreign investigators and journalists In April 1991 Carney was located with the help of at least two former Stasi intelligence officers turned informants In preparation for his apprehension he was quickly assigned to the 7350th Air Base Group at his former base Tempelhof Central Airport several months before his apprehension Ironically this assignment was official and had the unintended consequence of assigning Carney to a unit that supported Desert ShieldDesert Storm in 1991 As a result Carney received the National Defense Service Medal while in solitary confinement at Fort Leavenworth Kansas several years later On 22 April 1991 Carney was apprehended on a public street by AFOSI agents near his residence on Pintschstrae 12 in Friedrichshain which used to be in the Soviet sector of Berlin Immediately following his apprehension he was taken to Tempelhof Airport identified and underwent nearly 28 hours of intense interrogation after this Carney refused to answer any more questions after his repeated requests for counsel had been denied At this point the AFOSI in consultation with other US agencies decided to quietly remove Carney from German territory He was secretly flown to the United States aboard military aircraft the following day Carneys arrest and return to the United States was coordinated at the highest levels of the United States government without consulting German officials The US Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany Vernon Walters personally acted as adviser to the CommanderinChief United States Air Forces Europe urging haste

Carney pleaded guilty to charges of espionage conspiracy and desertion and was sentenced in December 1991 to 38 years in prison Carney served the mandatory portion of his sentence at both Quantico Virginia and later the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Fort Leavenworth Kansas Carney was released in 2002 after serving 11 years seven months and twenty days on a twentyyear sentence in accordance with his pretrial agreement

After his release from prison Carney attempted to return to Germany claiming to be a German citizen However as East Germany never naturalized him as a citizen and thus he had obtained his German passport fraudulently German authorities refused to grant him a passport He is reported to be living in Ohio In November 2011 Carney submitted a lengthy manuscript detailing his life as a spy to the United States Air Force for security review After numerous delays the manuscript was finally cleared on July 26 2012 The book Against All Enemies An Americans Cold War Journey was published in 2013

Opuntian Locris
Opuntian Locris or Eastern Locris was an ancient Greek region inhabited by the eastern division of the Locrians the socalled tribe of the Locri Epicnemidii  or Locri Opuntii Greek 

Opuntian Locris consisted of a narrow slip upon the eastern coast of central Greece from the pass of Thermopylae to the mouth of the river Cephissus The northern frontier town was Alpeni which bordered upon the Malians and the southern frontier town was Larymna which at a later time belonged to Boeotia The Locrians however did not inhabit this coast continuously but were separated by a narrow slip of Phocis which extended to the North Euboean Gulf and contained the Phocian seaport town of Daphnus The Locrians north of Daphnus were called Epicnemidii from Mount Cnemis and those south of this town were named Opuntii from Opus their principal city On the west the Locrians were separated from Phocis and Boeotia by a range of mountains extending from Mount Oeta and running parallel to the coast The northern part of this range called Mount Cnemis now Talanda rises to a considerable height and separated the Epicnemidii Locri from the Phocians of the upper valley of the Cephissus the southern portion which bore no specific name is not so lofty as Mount Cnemis and separated the Opuntian Locrians from the northeastern parts of Boeotia Lateral branches extended from these mountains to the coast of which one terminated in the promontory Cnemides opposite the islands called Lichades but there were several fruitful valleys and the fertility of the whole of the Locrian coast is praised both by ancient and modern observers In consequence of the proximity of the mountains to the coast there was no room for any considerable rivers The largest which however is only a mountain torrent is the Boagrius  called also Manes  by Strabo rising in Mount Cnemis and flowing into the sea between Scarpheia and Thronium The only other river mentioned by name is the Platanius a small stream which flows into the Opuntian gulf near the Boeotian frontier it is the river which flows from the modern village of Proskyn

The Opuntian Gulf at the head of which stood the town of Opus is a considerable bay shallow at its inner extremity In this bay close to the coast is the small island of Atalanta

The Eastern Locrians are mentioned by Homer who describes them as following Ajax the son of Oleus to the Trojan War in forty ships and as inhabiting the towns of Kynos Opus Calliarus Besa Scarphe Augeiae Tarphe and Thronium Neither Homer Herodotus Thucydides nor Polybius make any distinction between the Opuntii and Epicnemidii and during the flourishing period of Greek history Opus was regarded as the chief town of the Eastern Locrians Even Strabo from whom the distinction is chiefly derived in one place describes Opus as the metropolis of the Epicnemidii ix p416 and the same is confirmed by Pliny iv 7 s 12 and Stephanus In the Persian War the Opuntian Locrians fought with Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae and also sent seven ships to the Greek fleet The Locrians fought on the side of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War The Locri Opuntii also minted coins in antiquity some of which survive

The cities and towns of the Locri Epicnemidii along the coast from north to south were Alpenus Nicaea Scarphe Scarpheia Thronium Cnemis Cnemides more inland Tarphe later Pharygae and Augeiae The cities and towns of the Locri Opuntii along the coast from north to south were Alope Kynos Opus Halae Larymna which later belonged to Boeotia more inland Calliarus Naryx and Corseia

This large brick structure is one of three industrial buildings that share a secluded wellkept site in South Farms district Separated from Main Street Extension by trees and undergrowth the landscaped grounds are behind a row of East Main Street buildings This the largest structure adjoins a brick building south nearby to the east is a large barnlike structure

Since redeveloped during the 1980s the address of the complex is 282 Main Street Extension The previous entrance to East Main Street still exists as an exit

This large brick building was constructed probably a short time after the Russell Manufacturing Company obtained the property in 1884 The site formerly developed by the Sanseer Manufacturing Company includes a brick building which had been that companys main shop built in 1845 The Russell Manufacturing Company established in 1834 produced a great variety of cotton and elastic woven goods By 1894 it was the nations largest manufacturer of suspenders employing 900 workers in the companys seven groups of mills This mill powered by steam probably housed weaving looms as did the other two buildings nearby These structures formed the companys Sanseer Mill complex In 1937 Philip Bliss purchased the property which primarily used the property for office and storage space for the PH Bliss Company

The structure has two dominant vertical elements a fourstory stairwell extends from the middle of one side and a tall rectangular stack stands close by The main entrance displays a small wooden portico Its columns and plain entablature painted white contrast with the buildings brick walls

This structure one of the least altered early mills in the area reflect the substantial development South Farms underwent following the American Civil War During the late 19th century the district experienced marked industrial and residential growth primarily influenced by the success of the Russell Manufacturing Company

The Sanseer Mill was redeveloped into modern office space in the early 1980s During the 1990s to 2003 the building was owned by Whitney Garlinghouse owner of The Garlinghouse Company an architectural house plan company which housed its offices in the complex The old buildings were maintained in original condition at great expense The property was purchased by Dinar Chaudhury in 2006 Unfortunately the buildings have fallen into serious disrepair from the elements and neglect

State of Independence
State of Independence is a song written by Jon Anderson and Vangelis Cover versions have been recorded by several artists and it has been a hit single on three occasions The song is written in a reggaecalypso style and features an abstract spiritual lyric

Originally recorded by Jon and Vangelis for their 1981 album The Friends of Mr Cairo State of Independence was released as a single the same year but did not chart The song subsequently became better known when Donna Summer released a cover version a year later in 1982 which became a Top Twenty UK single and repeated the same feat 14 years later when issued as a remixed version in 1996 and becoming a Number One hit in the Netherlands In 1992 a third version of the song  retitled Spiritual High State of Independence  was recorded and released as a single by Moodswings with vocals by The Pretenders lead singer Chrissie Hynde

Jon  Vangelis released State of Independence as a single in 1981 with Beside as the BSide It was rereleased in 1984 and this version peaked at 67 in the UK Singles Chart

Jon Anderson recorded a new version of the song for his solo album Change We Must 1994 and a live acoustic version can be found on his Live from La La Land 2007 More recently Anderson also performed the song live with the AndersonPonty Band


Donna Summer covered State of Independence on her 1982 album Donna Summer produced by Quincy Jones It was released as the followup to her hit single Love Is in Control Finger on the Trigger in 1982 This version just missed the US Top 40 peaking at 41 It did much better in Europe including a oneweek stay at number one in the Dutch Top 40 making it Summers second charttopper in the Netherlands The single was reissued in Europe in 1990 following the release of the compilation album The Best of Donna Summer

Quincy Jones assembled an allstar choir for Summers recording including Lionel Richie Diana Ross Michael Jackson Brenda Russell Christopher Cross Dyan Cannon Peggy Lipton Dara Bernard James Ingram Kenny Loggins and Stevie Wonder Jones has claimed that this song was a dress rehearsal for the song We Are The World which was written by Jackson and Richie and was produced by Jones

Following the dance chart success of the 1995 remix of Donna Summers I Feel Love and clearly influenced by the 1992 Moodswings version PolyGram issued a remixed version of Summers recording of State of Independence The single released both on 12 vinyl and CD on PolyGrams sublabel Manifesto included mixes by Phil Ramocon Sold Out DJ Dero Ralph Falcon  Oscar G and Jules  Skins It peaked at 13 on the UK Singles Chart in 1996 going one place higher than the original release with the Dance mixes peaking at 1 in the UK Dance Music Charts The Martin Luther King sample introduced by Eddie Gordon into the track was to emphasize the full independent meaning of the song as he understood it

In 1992 the duo Moodswings released their album Moodfood Arista which scored a hit with a cover version of the single retitled as Spiritual High State of Independence Pt II with vocals by Chrissie Hynde The Pretenders and samples from Martin Luther King Jrs I Have a Dream speech The single peaked at 47 in the UK Singles Chart Their version was later played during the closing credits on the soundtrack of Single White Female and it was also included on The Pretenders Greatest Hits in 2000

Scimitarbill
Scimitarbills also spelt scimitarbills are three species of African bird belonging to the genus Rhinopomastus They are often classified in the woodhoopoe family Phoeniculidae however genetic studies show that they diverged from the true woodhoopoes about 10 million years ago and so they are sometimes placed in a family of their own the Rhinopomastidae

They are smaller than most woodhoopoes and their bills are strongly curved like a scimitar giving them their name They are mostly glossy black in colour with a few white markings on the wings While other woodhoopoes are gregarious birds which gather in flocks the scimitarbills are usually seen alone or in pairs

They feed mainly on insects and other invertebrates which they find by using their bills to probe into holes and crevices They are acrobatic birds welladapted for clambering through trees The eggs are laid in a tree cavity

Fort Belknap Indian Reservation
The Fort Belknap Indian Reservation is shared by two Native American tribes the Aaninin Gros Ventre and the Nakoda Assiniboine The reservation covers  and is located in north central Montana The total area includes the main portion of their homeland as well as offreservation trust land The tribes reported a total of 2851 enrolled members in 2010 The capital and largest city is Fort Belknap Agency at the reservations north end This is just south of the city of Harlem across the Milk River

In 2013 the tribes received part of a herd of bison and have reintroduced them to the local range In June 2015 the US Department of Interior sent some 3500 offers to buy back fractionated land worth more than 54 million affecting the future control of 26000 tracts of land within the boundaries of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation This was under the Land BuyBack Program for Tribal Nations established as part of the federal governments 2009 settlement of the landmark Cobell v Salazar suit over federal mismanagement of revenues due Indian landowners under the trust program

In October 1855 near the confluence of the Judith and Missouri rivers the Blackfoot Confederacy signed an agreement to remain at peace with other Native American tribes and with citizens of the United States The Nakoda Nation along with the Lakota Dakota Mandan Arikara Hidatsa Cheyenne and Arapaho had signed the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1851 with the United States government in what is now North Dakota These treaties established the tribes sacred territories within the continental United States

The Fort Belknap Reservation was established in 1888 in north central Montana It comprises a small portion of the vast ancestral territory of the Blackfoot Confederacy which consisted of the Aaniiih Nation Gros Ventre Northern and Southern Piegan and Blood tribes Their former territory extended across all of northcentral and eastern Montana and portions of eastern North Dakota Fort Belknap Reservation was named after William W Belknap the Secretary of War in President Ulysses S Grants administration Belknap was later impeached for corruption

The origins of the name Aaniiih meaning the White Clay People is unclear Many believe that they painted themselves with white clay found along the Saskatchewan River for ceremony like the northern Arapaho Early French fur trappers and traders named this tribe Gros Ventre Other tribes in the area referred to them as The Water Falls People Lacking a common language they used physical signs to indicate some terms The sign for waterfall was the passing of the hands over the stomach The French traders interpreted this as meaning big belly and called the Aaniiih the Gros Ventre meaning big belly in the French language

The Nakoda meaning the Generous Ones split with the Yanktonai Sioux in the seventeenth century They migrated from the Minnesota woodlands westward onto the northern plains with their allies the Plains Cree The Chippewa called the Nakoda Assiniboine in their language an Ojibwe word meaning One who cooks with stones The Nakoda would heat rocks and put them in rawhide pots to heat water and cook food The Nakoda peoples live on both the Fort Belknap and Fort Peck Indian reservations in Montana and on several reserves in Saskatchewan and Alberta Canada where they are generally known as Stoney

The Aaniiih and Nakoda were nomadic hunters and warriors They followed the bison commonly called buffalo for seasonal hunting they made use of all parts of the massive animals for food clothing cord tools etc Their food clothing and teepees were all derived from the buffalo The buffalo was the Indian staff of life supporting the nomadic cultures of the Nakoda Aaniih and other plains tribes The last wild herd of buffalo in the continental United States in the nineteenth century roamed between the Bear Paw Mountains and the Little Rocky Mountains in the lush Milk River valley of Montana

Today the two tribes are united as one federally recognized government called the Fort Belknap Indian Community Together the tribes have formed and maintained a community that has deep respect for its land its culture and its heritage Fort Belknap derives its name from the original military and trading post established on the Milk River The town of Chinook Montana developed about northeast of the fort

In March 2012 the Fort Belknap community received part of the herd of purebred Plains bison Bison bison bison from Yellowstone National Park that was transferred to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation The tribes on these reservations introduced the Bison to their local ranges a century after they were exterminated in the area


Generations after allotment was made of communal lands 94 years ago to individual tribal households under the Dawes Act control has become split up among thousands of descendants of original allottees in many federally recognized tribes The Fort Belknap Reservation has been described as one of the most fractionated in the country in terms of its landholdings with an estimated 75 of land on the reservation being fractionated under individual owners

As part of the 2009 settlement of the Cobell v Salazar class action suit the Department of Interior has set up the Land BuyBack Program for Tribal Nations to buy back such fractionated land from descendants on a purely voluntary basis with market value being offered The land portions of those who accept the offers will be put in federal trust under control of the tribe in order that it can increase the communal land base and improve its ability to manage resources for its members In 2015 more than 3500 buyback offers were mailed to tribal landowners at the beginning of June Some amounted to less than 100 others total tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars In June 2015 Interior employees came to the reservation to discuss the program in more detail They reviewed up to 54 million in offers with landowners who may be interested in selling their portions These offers apply to 26000 tracts of land most very small within the boundaries of the Fort Belknap reservation

Margey Azure tribal coordinator of the program believes it can help both individuals and the tribe She said Were in a position where we can consolidate these lands and maybe even help some young Indian operators get started in the cattle ranching business or something like that

2005 Azores subtropical storm
The 2005 Azores subtropical storm was the 19th nameable storm and only subtropical storm of the recordbreaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season It was not officially named by the US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a nontropical low The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a lowpressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October4 The storm was shortlived crossing over the Azores later on October4 before becoming extratropical again on October5 Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time After being absorbed into a cold front the system went on to become Hurricane Vince which affected the Iberian Peninsula

Months after the hurricane season when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review of the season and its named storms forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm Despite its unusual location and wide wind field the system had a welldefined centre convecting around a warm corethe hallmark of a subtropical storm

The system originated out of an upperlevel low just west of the Canary Islands on September28 The low organized itself over the next days producing several bursts of convection While remaining nontropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest On October3 it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles 460mi 740km southwest of So Miguel Island in the Azores Early on October4 convection increased as the surface low organized itself and the system became a subtropical depression

Around the same time the depression turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front and strengthened into a subtropical storm The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly reaching its peak intensity of 50mph 85kmh as it approached the Azores that evening After tracking through the Azores the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the northnortheast Through an interaction with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October8

At the time the system was not believed to have been subtropical However there were several postseason findings that confirmed that the system was indeed a subtropical storm The first was the cloud pattern in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a welldefined center of circulation In addition the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones The warmcore nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found however the widespread wind field and the presence of an upperlevel trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical

Tropical stormforce winds were reported across parts of the Azores primarily on the eastern islands The strongest winds were reported on Santa Maria Island where 10minute sustained winds reached 49mph 79kmh with gusts to 59mph 94kmh Ponta Delgada faced 38mph 61kmh winds with the peak recorded gust being 52mph 85kmh No damage or fatalities were reported

The storm was not classified as a subtropical storm until April10 2006 after a reassessment by the National Hurricane Center Every year the NHC reanalyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history frequently if there is new data that was operationally unavailable If the storm had been operationally recognized it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy and storms forming after October4 would have been moved one name down the list Hurricane Wilma would have been given the name Alpha a name that had it been retired like Wilma was could not be replaced by an alternate Greek letter as is the convention with names on the standard AW list When the system strengthened into a subtropical storm on October4 it was the earliest the 19th tropical or subtropical storm of the season formed The old record was held by an unnamed storm in the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season which formed on October25 1933 It was also only the fourth time that 19storms formed in a season

Tremec TR6060 transmission
The Tremec TR6060 sixspeed manual transmission features six forward speeds and one reverse speed It is derived from the Tremec T56 6speed manual transmission As usual the forward helical cut gears are synchronized however the reverse gear operates through a fully synchronized constantmesh system The TR6060 contains removable wear pads on the shift forks and uses aluminum alloys for the main case extension housing and clutch housing It is manufactured by TREMEC formerly Transmission Technologies Corporation and is rated for of torque

The FG Falcon launch documentation describes the new gearbox The new synchroniser package features triple synchromesh on first and second gears and double synchromesh on all other gears including reverse which has significantly reduced gear shift efforts and shift travel

The reduced shift travel provided by the synchroniser package has also allowed increased space for the use of larger gears which are stronger to deliver improved torque capacity and gearbox durability A new singlepiece counter shaft also contributes to the greater torque capacity and durability enhancements

Other features of the new TR6060 transmission include

In 1932 a luxury yacht is sailing through a channel off the western coast of South America The captain is worried about the channel lights not matching the charts but is quickly dissuaded from changing course by the wealthy passengers for the sake of time including famous big game hunter and author Bob Rainsford Joel McCrea It is a calm evening with the cheerful passengers relaxing over drinks and a game of cards Bob and his companions are debating about whether hunting is at all sporting for the animal being hunted after a friend asks if he would exchange places with a tiger he had recently hunted in Africa Bob replies that there are two kinds of people in the world those who hunt and those who are hunted

The ship suddenly runs aground causing the ship to take on water and heave violently Water floods the boiler room causing the ship to explode and sink into the channel Rainsford and two others manage to get away and cling to wreckage but the other survivors are eaten by a shark He swims to a small lush island Wandering through the jungle he sees the channel lights off the shoreline change and suspects the ship was deliberately led off course to its doom

He decides that as Bob refuses to be a fellow hunter he must be the next prey If Rainsford can stay alive until sunrise Zaroff promises him and Eve their freedom However he has never lost the game of what he calls outdoor chess Eve decides to go with Rainsford The two initially succeed in avoiding Zaroff and his dogs

Eventually they are trapped by a waterfall When Rainsford is attacked by a hunting dog Zaroff shoots and the young man falls into the water Zaroff takes Eve back to his fortress to enjoy his prize However the dog was shot not Rainsford

Rainsford eventually shows up while Zaroff plays the piano for pleasure Zaroff says Rainsford has beaten him and gives him the key to the boathouse but Rainsford discovers him holding a gun behind his back Rainsford first fights Zaroff then his henchmen killing the henchmen and mortally wounding Zaroff As Rainsford and Eve speed away in a motor boat the dying Zaroff tries to shoot them Unsuccessful he succumbs to his wounds He falls out of a window into the pack of his frenzied hunting dogs

The Most Dangerous Game was filmed at night on the same sets used in King Kong 1933 with two of the same actors Fay Wray and Robert Armstrong

The film made a profit of 70000 during its first year of release

The Most Dangerous Game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon its release
Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three out of four stars calling it a Vivid telling of Richard Connells oftfilmed story 
British magazine Time Out gave the film a positive review praising the films acting and suspense calling it one of the best and most literate movies from the great days of horror

On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 100 based on  with a weighted average rating of 7710

The Most Dangerous Game lapsed into the public domain in 1960 and has since seen a plethora of budget releases The first highquality edition was via a 1995 LaserDisc from the ROAN Group In 1999 Criterion released a restored DVD featuring an audio commentary by film historian Bruce Eder The film was initially colorized in 1992 and again using improved technology in 2008 by Legend Films who subsequently released their version on DVD alongside the BW version

In 2012 Flicker Alley released the film on a regionfree Bluray this version was restored from the original 35mm studio fine grain master by film preservionist David Shepard The Bluray also included Gow the Headhunter 1931 aka Cannibal Island an audio commentary for each film and an audio interview with Merian C Cooper conducted by film historian Kevin Brownlow

The Richard Connell short story has been adapted for film a number of times and its basic concept has been borrowed for numerous films and episodes of television series Gilligans Island Lost in Space Get Smart Fantasy Island Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity and Predators among others

The 1932 film was referenced in the plot of the David Fincher movie Zodiac 2007 Jake Gyllenhaals character recognizes quotes from the film in letters from the Zodiac Killer sent to the newspaper office where he works

Rabbit Semiconductor
Rabbit Semiconductor is an American company which designs and sells the Rabbit family of microcontrollers and microcontroller modules
For development it provides Dynamic C a nonstandard dialect of C with proprietary structures for multitasking

Rabbit Semiconductor was purchased in 2006 by Digi International Before the purchase Rabbit Semiconductor was a division of ZWorld Inc ZWorld developed and manufactured embedded controller products as well as embedded software development environments

The Rabbit processor family shares many features with the Zilog Z80Z180 processors For example the registers of a Rabbit 20003000 processor are almost the same as the registers of a Z80Z180 processor The Rabbit 4000 processor expands to include the use of 32bit registers The instruction set of Rabbit processors also closely resembles the instruction set of the Z80Z180 family While the opcodes of many instructions are the same between the Rabbit 20003000 processors and Z80Z180 processors the two families of processors are not binary compatible

The Rabbit processor family has unique features For example the Z80Z180 family disables interrupts once an interrupt is serviced by an interrupt service routine However the Rabbit processors permit interrupts to interrupt service routines according to priorities a total of 4

As with the Z80Z180 family the Rabbit processors are CISC processors as opposed to RISC competitors like the Atmel AVR processors A comparison of clocks per instruction of the Rabbit processor against a typical RISC processor like the AVR reveals that even though the Rabbit processors can use a faster clock up to 60MHz the effective processing power is comparable to that of a similarlypriced AVR processor using a slower clock up to 32MHz For example the INC IXd instruction requires 11 to 13 clock cycles depending on specific processor and on operand characteristics on a Rabbit processor The equivalent instruction sequence LDD INC STD on an AVR requires 5 clock cycles Another example is the CALL instruction It requires 11 to 13 clock cycles depending on specific processor and on operand characteristics on a Rabbit microprocessor versus 4 to 5 cycles on an AVR processor
This difference in part is due to the AVR using onchip memory for both instructions and data whereas the Rabbit uses offchip memory for both instructions and data

Rabbit Semiconductor claims that the instruction set of Rabbit processors is optimized for C code A similar claim is made by Atmel for their AVR processors The two architectures actually have very similar addressing modes such as literal register indirect and indirect plus displacement Furthermore both architectures have specialized 16bit registers The Rabbit has IX IY and SP whereas the AVR has X Y and Z

The main difference is that the Rabbit instructions place more constraints on register usage compared to the AVR instructions For example the 8bit Rabbit ADD instruction permits only the Aregister be the destination However the ADD instruction of the AVR permits the use any one of the 32 8bit registers as the source or destination Generally speaking an instruction set that is less register restrictive is more optimizable because there is less need to saveandreload the content of a register

Perhaps the most notable feature of the Rabbit microcontroller is its development environment Dynamic C a product of Rabbit Semiconductor has additions deletions and inconsistencies compared to the ANSIC standard


Dynamic C follows the ISOANSI C standard when feasible and desirable Because the standard does not 
take into account the special needs of embedded systems it is necessary to depart from the standard in 
some areas and desirable in others The standard does not take into account important embedded systems 
issues such as read only memory and embedded assembly language For this reason practical compilers 
intended for embedded systems do not completely comply with the standard but use it as a guide 
As an example of an addition Dynamic C has a chaining mechanism to chain fragments of code from different subroutines to an arbitrary number of chains This extension permits the use of not only initialized variables but any arbitrary code to execute before a program starts execution in the main function

As an example of a deletion as of version 1023 Dynamic C does not support block scope variables or bit fields The development toolchain does not include a separate preprocessor and linker which may complicate the process of porting existing programs to the compiler As of version 1064 block scope for variables is supported

As an example of an inconsistency Dynamic C implicitly treats all initialized global variables as if they were declared with the codice1 qualifier Furthermore all codice1 variables reside in flash memory Earlier versions of Dynamic C did not check the use of the codice1 keyword in parametersit was possible to pass a codice1 variable as a parameter to a function that did not expect it potentially leading to attempts to write to flash memory As of the latest version of Dynamic C the compiler will produce an error when the user attempts to modify a codice1 variable directly and will produce a warning if the user discards the codice1 qualifier when passing a parameter to a function

One noteworthy feature of Dynamic C is its inclusion of language constructs to simplify multitasking These constructs the codice7 statement and the codice8 statement implement a form of cooperative and preemptive multitasking respectively As an example consider the following program which flashes two LEDs with different frequencies

When this code is run the first costatement will be executed and the first LED will turn on The costatement will then yield to the second statement while it waits for 100 milliseconds The second costatement will execute in a similar manner While both costatements are waiting for their time to elapse the while loop will busywait but this waiting time could potentially be used to perform other tasks For more information see the Dynamic C Users Manual

<doc id="7715317" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715317" title="Ground glass joint">
Ground glass joint
Ground glass joints are used in laboratories to quickly and easily fit leaktight apparatus together from commonly available parts For example a round bottom flask Liebig condenser and oil bubbler with ground glass joints may be rapidly fitted together to reflux a reaction mixture This is a large improvement compared with older methods of custommade glassware which was timeconsuming and expensive or the use of less chemical resistant and heat resistant corks or rubber bungs and glass tubes as joints which took time to prepare as well

To connect the hollow inner spaces of the glassware components ground glass joints are hollow on the inside and open at the ends except for stoppers

Crude versions of conically tapered ground glass joints have been made for quite a while particularly for stoppers for glass bottles and retorts These days ground glass joints can be precisely ground to a reproducible taper or shape They are made to join two glassware pieces together One of the glassware items to be joined would have an inner or male joint with the ground glass surface facing outward and the other would have an outer or female joint of a correspondingly fitting taper with the ground glass surface facing inward

Two general types of ground glass joints are fairly commonly used joints which are slightly conically tapered and ball and socket joints sometimes called spherical joints

The conically tapered ground glass joints typically have a 110 taper and are often labeled with a symbol  consisting of a capital T overlaid on a capital S meaning Standard Taper This symbol is followed by a number a slash and another number The first number represents the outer diameter OD in millimeters at the widest point of the inner male joint The second number represents the ground glass length of the joint in millimeters Internationally the ISO sizes are used with 1423 1926 and 2429 very common in research laboratories with 2429 the most common In the US the ASTM sizes equal to the now obsolete Commercial Standard 21 are used with common sizes being 1420 1922 2440 and somewhat 2942 In the US 2440 is most common


For ballandsocket joints also known as spherical joints the inner joint is a ball and the outer joint is a socket both having holes leading to the interior of their respective tube ends to which they are fused The ball tip is a hemisphere with a groundglass surface on the outside which fits inside of the socket where the ground glass surface is on the inside Ballandsocket joints are labeled with a size code consisting of a number a slash and another number The first number represents the outer diameter in millimeters of the ball at its base or the inner diameter in millimeters at the tip of the socket in both cases where the diameters are their maximum in the joints

The second number represents the inner diameter of the hole in the middle of the ball or socket which leads to the inner diameter of the tube fused to the joint

If the angle standard taper fittings make with glassware is not perfectly set the glass is extremely rigid and brittle presenting a fracture risk on some setups A ball and socket joining method allows some flexibility in the mating angles of the pieces being joined which can be particularly important with heavy flasks or long pieces of glassware that would otherwise be difficult to support and potentially snap under bending loads A common example of this is the collection flask on a rotary evaporator whose weight increases significantly as it fills A ball and socket allows the flask to plumb itself without placing a bending load on the joint Such a socket might also be used on a larger but more typical distillation setup at the head and before the condenser This allows the long span of the condenser the nonperfect angle of the receiving bend and the filling flask to be supported more easily as their angle with the still head has a few degrees of positioning freedom

They can also be found as the necks on pilot plant production flasks where large volumes and masses are present and on some Schlenk lines where the long spans of fine glass benefit from a little flexibility between pieces Generally when considering smaller glassware ball and sockets are far outnumbered by standard tapers

Round slightly spiral threaded connections are possible on tubular ends of glass items Such glass threading can face the inside or the outside In use glass threading is screwed into or onto nonglass threaded material such as plastic Glass vials typically have outer threaded glass openings onto which caps can be screwed on Bottles and jars in which chemicals are sold transported and stored usually have threaded openings facing the outside and matching nonglass caps or lids

Laboratory glassware such as Buchner flasks and Liebig condensers may have tubular glass tips serving as hose connectors with several ridged hose barbs around the diameter near the tip This is so that the tips can have the end of a rubber or plastic tube mounted over them to connect the glassware to another system such as a vacuum water supply or drain A special clip may be placed over the end of the flexible tube surrounding the connector tip to prevent the hose from slipping off the connector

A number of brands including Quickfit have begun using threaded connections for hose barbs This allows the barb to be unscrewed from the glassware the hose pushed on and the setup screwed back together This helps avoid accidentally breaking the glass and potentially doing serious harm to the chemist as will sometimes occur when pushing the hoses directly onto the glass

For either standard taper joints or ballandsocket joints inner and outer joints with the same numbers are made to fit together When the joint sizes are different ground glass adapters may be available or made to place in between to connect them Special clips or pinch clamps may be placed around the joints to hold them in place

Roundbottom flasks often have one or more conically tapered ground glass joint openings or necks Conventionally these joints at the flask necks are outer joints Other adapters such as distillation heads and vacuum adapters are made with joints that fit in with this convention If a flask or other container has an extra outer groundglass joint on it which needs to be closed off for an experiment there are often conically tapered inner groundglass stoppers for that purpose In some cases small hooklike glass protrusions may be fused onto the rest of the glass item near a joint to allow an end loop of a small spring to be attached so the spring helps keep joints temporarily together The use of a special very small size of conically tapered fitting for glass plastic or metal parts called a Luer fitting or adapter has become more widespread Originally Luer fittings were used to connect the hub of a needle to a syringe Where the use of ground glass presents a problem as in the production or distillation of diazomethane which may explode on contact with rougher surfaces equipment with smooth glass joints may be used

To prevent a joint from separating during a reaction process various types of plastic or metal clips or springs can be used to secure the two sides together They are available in a variety of materials for different temperature and chemical environments

Patented in 1984 by Hermann Keck plastic joint clips are usually made of polyacetal and are colored according to joint sizes Polyacetal melts at a reasonably low temperature around 175C and begins to soften around 140C As glassware temperatures are recommended up to 250C care needs to be taken that clips made from this material are not being used to hold glass together that will get this hot Typical problem areas include a flask over the plate which may drop off the end of the column as it gets hot and the connection the condenser makes to the still head which will reach high temperatures and may allow the condenser to fall off As such different clips should be used at these points or the glassware should be clamped such that these elements cant slide apart or dont need the clip Polyacetal clips suffer another problem in that the material is strongly affected by corrosive gases This effect can be so dramatic that the clip will fall apart in minutes of exposure to minute quantities leaking through even greased ground tapers Importantly this failure mode is sudden and without warning

PTFE joint clips are sometimes used as its recommended temperature peak matches that of most practical chemistry work Its highly inert nature also makes it immune to degradation around the corrosive gases However it is both expensive and will begin producing perfluoroisobutylene if heated to beyond its specified temperature so care must be taken to avoid this given the level of risk the result presents The same is true of using Krytox and chemically resistant Molykote PTFE thickened fluoro based oils and greases for glassware seals High grade stainless steel joint clip is a final option Naturally this can withstand the entire temperature spectrum of borosilicate glass and is reasonably inert Though lower grades of stainless steel are still rapidly attacked in the presence of the corrosive gases and the clips themselves are often as expensive as PTFE

Some glassware features barbs devils horns Viking helmet sticking out the sides of the tapers Small stainless steel springs are used on these to hold the joint together The use of springs is of particular benefit when dealing with positive pressures as they apply enough force for the glass to operate but will open the taper if an unexpected excursion occurs This method is considered quite old fashioned but is still used on some of the most well known and highend glassware available

For situations where the simple spring action of metal wires or plastic is not strong enough or are not convenient for other reasons screws can be used to hold joints together Plastic collars are often used on microscale equipment

A thin layer of PTFE material or grease is usually applied to the groundglass surfaces to be connected and the inner joint is inserted into the outer joint such that the groundglass surfaces of each are next to each other to make the connection The use of this helps provide a good seal and prevents the joint from seizing allowing the parts to be disassembled easily Although silicone grease used as a sealant and a lubricant for interconnecting ground glass joints is normally assumed to be chemically inert some compounds have resulted from unintended reactions with silicones

Sometimes conical ground glass joints can lock together preventing the user from rotating them  this is known as freezing or locking Ball and sockettype joints are much less susceptible since they have more degrees of rotation than a conical joint This may happen for a variety of reasons

Frozen joints may be removed by working solvent into the joint while rocking the stopper heating the outer joint or cooling the inner stopper The last two methods employ the property of thermal expansion to create a small space between the two surfaces There are also specialized glassblowing tools to unfreeze the joint

Harpoon reaction
Harpoon reactions are a type of chemical reaction between two substances one generally a metal prone to form a cation and the other generally a halogen prone to form an anion

Their main feature is that these reactions unlike most reactions have steric factors greater than unity that is they take place faster than predicted by collision theory This is explained by the fact that the colliding particles have greater cross sections than the pure geometrical ones calculated from their radii because when the particles are close enough an electron jumps therefore the name from one of the particles to the other one forming an anion and a cation which subsequently attract each other Harpoon reactions usually take place in the gas phase but they are also possible in condensed media

The predicted rate constant can be improved by using a better estimation of the steric factor A rough approximation is that the largest separation R at which charge transfer can take place on energetic grounds can be estimated from the solution of the following equation that determines the largest distance at which the Coulombic attraction between the two oppositely charged ions is sufficient to provide the energy E

With formula2 where IP is the ionization potential of the metal and EA is the electron affinity of the halogen

Fan Chou was from Jincheng Commandery  Liang Province which is around presentday Yuzhong County Gansu He started his career as a subordinate of the warlord Dong Zhuo who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian between 189 and 192

After Dong Zhuo was assassinated in Changan in 192 Fan Chou joined a group of Dong Zhuos followers led by Li Jue and Guo Si and seized back control of Changan from Wang Yun and L Bu Li Jue and Guo Si then controlled the Han central government and Emperor Xian in the same way Dong Zhuo did Around this time they promoted Fan Chou to the rank of a General of the Household 

In 194 when a rival warlord Ma Teng led his forces to attack Li Jue and Guo Si Fan Chou led troops to resist the enemy and defeated them at Changping Pass  In the same year he also defeated Qiang rebels in Zuopingyi  around presentday Dali County Shaanxi and was further promoted to General of the Right  He became one of the most powerful figures in the Han central government alongside Li Jue and Guo Si at the time

During the battle against Ma Teng Fan Chou had scolded Li Jues nephew Li Li  who accompanied him into battle for not doing his best Li Li bore a grudge against Fan Chou for this Later he secretly reported to his uncle that Fan Chou was plotting with another rival warlord Han Sui against him Li Jue thus became suspicious of Fan Chou especially as Fan Chou gained higher status and more power In 195 Li Jue and Guo Si lured Fan Chou into a trap and assassinated him

Thea Foss Waterway
The Thea Foss Waterway formerly the City Waterway is a northsouth inlet of Commencement Bay separating downtown Tacoma Washington from the Port of Tacoma

Tacoma was the site of an early sawmill in 1853
The deepwater port began to boom in the 1870s sailing
ships and steam tugs called in The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived by way of the Columbia River in 1874and the port began to boom the line via Montana was finished in 1883 but access from California and Nevada did not come till 1891 Tea wheat lumber coal and apples were moved Trade with Asia exploded A through railway line was built across the Cascade mountains at Stampede Pass in 1890s and Tacoma began is longtime rivalry with its upstart neighbor 25 miles to the north

Thea Foss the waterways namesake founded the Foss Maritime Company on the inlet in 1889 She expanded
with rowboats naptha launches and steam tugs Foss Tug became the preeminent towing company in Puget Sound Today Foss is the largest tug concern on the Pacific Coast

Initially the railroads owned the foreshore as they continue to do till this day But the City Fathers of Tacoma saw the need to wrest control of the land and
build the port In 1919 the Port of Tacoma was established to capture Panama Canal Traffic and the 
sprawling port was expanded into the river delta
Another major railroad arrivedthe Milwaukee Road and it brought further trade

Sawmills cedar shingle mills boat yards wharves graneries
and warehouses proliferated in the area Railroad yards extended on
the flat foreshore Fishworks and processing plants were set up on the shore

101 years ago the Thea Foss Waterway was a thriving industrial center Industry began to dwindle in the area and by 1981 the Thea Foss Waterway was almost entirely abandoned In 1983 the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA listed the Thea Foss and WheelerOsgood waterways as part of the larger Commencement Bay Superfund site The final cap from the Superfund cleanup action on the Thea Foss Waterway occurred back in February 2006 
As of 2010 planned development is underway along the waterway When complete the new development will feature parks residential areas and office space A public esplanade will run along the length of the waterway 7 of the 15 development sites are either constructed or have specific plans for redevelopment The project is overseen by the Foss Waterway Development Authority Board FWDA 

Local leaders see the Thea Foss Waterway as an economic opportunity and seek to restore it to the commercial hub that it once was

Type 5 KeHo light tank
The was a prototype light tank developed by the Imperial Japanese Army at the end of World War II

In 1938 development began for a new light tank for the Japanese Army While the Type 95 HaGo had performed well against the National Revolutionary Army of the China in the Second SinoJapanese War and successfully engaged United States M3 Stuart light tanks on the Bataan Peninsula in December 1941 it was quickly growing obsolete Although its 37mm gun was adequate for most light armor designed and built in the 1930s the HaGo like the tanks of the US Army prior to 1941 was not designed to fight enemy tanks but rather to support the infantry The Type 95s light armor made it vulnerable to 50 caliber machine gun fire and attempts to address these shortcomings via the Type 98 KeNi and Type 2 KeTo were steps in the right direction but were still insufficient Therefore a complete design review was held and a prototype for a new standard light tank was completed by 1942 At this point the project was shelved as the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff had to concede to the Imperial Navys needs of raw materials necessary for the production of warships and warplanes Mass production was finally authorized in 1945 by which time it was too late Production was impossible due to shortages of materials such as steel and the bombing of Japan Only a single prototype was completed by the Hino Jido Sha company by the end of World War II

The Type 5 KeHo had armor of up to 20mm and a Type 1 47mm main gun an improvement over existing Japanese light tanks The tank weighed 10 tons due to increased armor thickness and a bigger engine The twoman turret layout drew on previous design experience from the Type 1 ChiHe

The tank was powered by a Type 100 air cooled diesel engine yielding 150 HP for a top speed of 50kmh Details about the engine design still remains unknown One theory indicates it was an improved version of the Chiyoda EC engine manufactured by Tokyo Gas and Electronics Industry in 1937 The tank also had a fuel tank capacity of 130 L

The Balkan frog Pelophylax kurtmuelleri also known as the Balkan water frog and Greek marsh frog is a species of frog occurring in Greece and to a lesser extent in Albania Montenegro and Serbia The species highly resembles Pelophylax ridibundus from which it was only distinguished in 1991 by bioacoustic analysis The separation of the species is not unanimously accepted

The average length is 72mm for males 78mm for females The back is green or occasionally brown often with a light green stripe down the middle and with darker spots irregularly distributed across the back The tympanum is bronze or green surrounded by a darker color

The species is found across Greece except in the northeastern corner where P ridibundus is found instead In Western Greece it lives along with Pelophylax epeiroticus It occurs from sea level up to 1000 m though large populations are not found above 600 m Small introduced populations live in Denmark and Italy

Seth Wetmore House
The Seth Wetmore House is a residence built in the CenterHall Colonial style in 1746 at 1066 Washington Street Middletown Connecticut
It was built of Clapboard siding Brownstone foundation with asphalt shingle roof using a structural system of wood frame post and beam with gable roof It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 10 1970

This centerhall Colonial house faces east from the northwest corner of Washington Street Extension and Camp Street From this site on the east slope of a ridge it commands a long view east Although Washington Street Extension psses close by on the southwest the house is obscured from view by thickly planted trees

Judge Seth Wetmore 17001788 built this house in 1746 Judge Wetmore served as deputy to the General Assembly for fortyeight terms and was Judge of the County Court at Hartford No doubt one of the great local mansions of its day it remains Middletowns best example of high style Georgian architecture the interior is of exceptional sophistication in its appointments the northeast parlor alone is justly famous for the high quality of its decoration It displays in original condition a corner shell cupboard with sunburst decoration marbleized fluted pilasters at either side of the fireplace opening and fine overmantel painting The woodwork in this room is in its original condition and excellently preserved

Although the builder of this house is unknown it is evident that he was a master joiner A house recorded in a Colonial Dames monograph William Cooper House destroyed 1930d bears such marked similarities to this house that it is likely they were built by the same man

This house remained in the Wetmore family for over two hundred years and there are many traditions concerning the house including visits by Jonathan Edwards Timothy Dwight IV Aaron Burr and General Lafayette A large hemlock on the property is said to have been planted by Judge Wetmores daughter Lucy

The Judge Seth Wetmore House is significant for its long association with the Wetmore family and as Middletowns finest example of Georgian Colonial architecture

<doc id="7715554" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715554" title="West Virginia Penitentiary">
West Virginia Penitentiary
The West Virginia Penitentiary is a gothicstyle prison located in Moundsville West Virginia Now withdrawn and retired from prison use it operated from 1876 to 1995 Currently the site is maintained as a tourist attraction and training facility

The Penitentiarys design is similar to the facility at the 1858 state prison in Joliet Illinois with its castellated Gothic stone structure complete with turrets and battlements except it is scaled down to half the size The original architectural designs have been lost The dimensions of the parallelogramshaped prison yard are 82 feet in length by 352 feet in width The stone walls are thick at the base tapering to 2 feet at the top with foundations deep The center tower section is long It lies at the western side of the complex along Jefferson Avenue and is considered the front as this is where the main entrance is located The walls here are high and wide at the base tapering to towards the top

In 1863 West Virginia seceded from Virginia at the height of the American Civil War Consequently the new state had a shortage of various public institutions including prisons From 1863 to 1866 Governor Arthur I Boreman lobbied the West Virginia Legislature for a state penitentiary but was repeatedly denied The Legislature at first directed him to send the prisoners to other institutions out of the state and then they directed him to use existing county jails which turned out to be inadequate After nine inmates escaped in 1865 the local press took up the cause and the Legislature took action On February 7 1866 the state legislature approved the purchase of land in Moundsville for the purpose of constructing a state prison Ten acres were purchased just outside the then city limits of Moundsville for 3000 Moundsville proved an attractive site as it is approximately twelve miles south of Wheeling West Virginia which at that time was the state capital

The state built a temporary wooden prison nearby that summer This gave prison officials time to assess what prison design should be used They chose a modified version of the design of Northern Illinois Penitentiary at Joliet Its Gothic Revival architecture exhibited as much as possible great strength and conveyed to the mind a cheerless blank indicative of the misery which awaits the unhappy being who enters within its walls

The first building constructed on the site was the North Wagon Gate It was made with handcut sandstone which was quarried from a local site The state used prison labor during the construction process and work continued on this first phase until 1876 When completed the total cost was of 363061 In addition to the North Wagon Gate there was now north and south cellblock areas both measuring 300ft by 52ft South Hall had 224 cells 7ft by 4ft and North Hall had a kitchen dining area hospital and chapel A 4story tower connecting the two was the administration building measuring 75ft by 75ft It included space for female inmates and personal living quarters for the warden and his family The facility officially opened in this year and it had a prison population of 251 male inmates including some who had helped construct the prison where they were incarcerated After this phase work began on prison workshops and other secondary facilities

In addition to construction the inmates had other jobs to do in support of the prison In the early 1900s some industries within the prison walls included a carpentry shop a paint shop a wagon shop a stone yard a brickyard a blacksmith a tailor a bakery and a hospital At the same time revenue from the prison farm and inmate labor helped the prison financially It was virtually selfsufficient A prison coal mine located a mile away opened in 1921 This mine helped fill some of the prisons energy needs and saved the state an estimated 14000 a year Some inmates were allowed to stay at the mines camp under the supervision of a mine foreman who was not a prison employee

Conditions at the prison during the turn of the 20th century were good according to a wardens report which stated that both the quantity and the quality of all the purchases of material food and clothing have been very gradually but steadily improved while the discipline has become more nearly perfect and the exaction of labor less stringent Education was a priority for the inmates during this time They regularly attended class Construction of a school and library was completed in 1900 to help reform and educate inmates

However the conditions at the prison worsened through the years and the facility would be ranked on the United States Department of Justices Top Ten Most Violent Correctional Facilities list One of the more infamous locations in the prison with instances of gambling fighting and raping was a recreation room known as The Sugar Shack

A notable inmate in the early 20th century was labor activist Eugene V Debs who served time here from April 13 to June 14 1919 at which time he was transferred to an Atlanta prison on charges of violating the Espionage Act of 1917

In 1929 the state decided to double the size of the penitentiary because overcrowding was a problem The 5 x cells were too small to hold three prisoners at a time but until the expansion there was no other option Two prisoners would sleep in the bunks with the third sleeping on a mattress on the floor The state used prison labor again and completed this phase of construction in 1959 The construction had been delayed by a steel shortage during World War II

In total thirtysix homicides took place in the prison One of the more notable ones is the butchering of RD Wall inmate number 44670 On October 8 1929 after snitching on his fellow inmates he was attacked while heading to the boiler room by three prisoners with dull shivs

In 1983 convicted multiple murderer Charles Manson requested to be transferred to this prison to be nearer to his family His request was denied

On Wednesday November 7 1979 fifteen prisoners escaped from the prison One of the escapees was Ronald Turney Williams serving time for murdering Sergeant David Lilly of the Beckley Police Department on May 12 1975 He managed to steal a prison guards service weapon in the escape and upon reaching the streets of Moundsville encountered twentythreeyearold offduty West Virginia State Trooper Philip S Kesner who was driving past the prison with his wife

Trooper Kesner saw the escapees and attempted to take action against them The prisoners pulled him from his car and Williams shot him Trooper Kesner returned fire at the fleeing suspects despite being mortally wounded

Williams remained at large for eighteen months sending taunting notes to authorities and making the FBIs Ten Most Wanted List During that time he murdered John Bunchek in Scottsdale Arizona during a robbery and was connected to crimes in Colorado and Pennsylvania After a shootout with federal agents at the George Washington Hotel in New York City in 1981 he was apprehended and returned to West Virginia to complete several life sentences Arizona had sought his extradition for his execution but as of he remains in West Virginia custody

At the time Marshall County Sheriff Robert Lightner was very critical about poor police communications during the break The sheriffs office and local police did not learn about the escape from the state police They first heard of it over the police scanner It was a good twenty minutes before we knew about the escape If somebody had notified us theres a good chance that the sheriffs department and the Moundsville police could have been on the scene while all the prisoners were still on the block He was also critical of the fourstate manhunt that followed when convicted murderers David Morgan and Ronald T Williams along with convicted rapist Harold Gowers Jr remained at large Communications have been very poor I think they should keep the local law enforcement officers more informed I have no idea what theyre doing what theyve found

January 1 1986 was the date of one of the most infamous riots in recent history The West Virginia Penitentiary was undergoing many changes and problems Security had become extremely loose in all areas Since it was a cons prison most of the locks on the cells had been picked and inmates roamed the halls freely Bad plumbing and insects caused rapid spreading of various diseases The prison was holding more than 2000 men and crowding was an issue Another major contribution to the riots cause was the fact that it was a holiday Many of the officers had called off work and prisoners planned to conduct their uprising on this specific day

At around 530pm twenty inmates known as a group called the Avengers stormed the mess hall where Captain Glassock and others were on duty Within seconds he Captain Glassock five other officers and a food service worker were tackled and slammed to the floor Inmates put knives to their throats and handcuffed them with their own handcuffs Although several hostages were taken throughout the day none of them were seriously injured However over the course of the twoday upheaval three inmates were killed for an assortment of reasons The inmates who initiated the riot were not prepared to take charge of it Danny Lehman the Avengers president was quickly agreed upon as best suited for the task of negotiating with authorities and presenting the demands to the media Yet Lehman was not a part of the twenty men who began the riot Governor Arch A Moore Jr went to the penitentiary to talk with the inmates This meeting set up a new list of rules and standards on which the prison would build National and local news covered the story as well as the inmates meeting with Governor Moore

Toward the end of its life as a prison the facility was marked by many instances of riots and escapes In the 1960s the prison reached a peak population of about 2000 inmates With the building of more prisons that number declined to 600  700 inmates by 1995 The fate of the prison was sealed in a 1986 ruling by the West Virginia Supreme Court which stated that confinement to the 5 x cells constituted cruel and unusual punishment Within nine years West Virginia Penitentiary was closed as a prison Most of the inmates were transferred to the Mt Olive Correctional Complex in Fayette County West Virginia A smaller correctional facility was built a mile away in Moundsville to serve as a regional jail

From 1899 to 1959 ninetyfour men were executed at the prison Hanging was the method of execution until 1949 with eightyfive men meeting that fate The public could attend hangings which were public until June 19 1931 On that date Frank Hyer was executed for murdering his wife When the trap door beneath him was opened and his full weight settled into the noose he was instantly decapitated Following this event attendance at hangings was by invitation only The last man executed by hanging Bud Peterson from Logan County was buried in the prisons cemetery because his family refused to claim his body

Beginning in 1951 electrocution became the means of execution The electric chair nicknamed Old Sparky used by the prison was originally built by an inmate there Paul Glenn Nine men were electrocuted before the state prohibited capital punishment entirely in 1965 The original chair is on display in the facility and is included in the official tour

After the prison closed its doors as a state institution the Moundsville Economic Development Council obtained a 25year lease on the complex The facility is used for training law enforcement and corrections practitioners with regular mockriot drills To assist teams in the planning and execution of scenarios the West Virginia High Technology Consortium Foundation commissioned The 3D Model of the West Virginia Penitentiary an interactive 3D model of the penitentiary It made the software available to the public prior to conducting the 2009 Mock Prison Riot Some previous training programs for law enforcement officials that took place here such as the National Corrections and Law Enforcement Training and Technology Center are now discontinued

Tours are available for tourists wishing to see the prison The Elizabethtown Festival is held every May to celebrate and remember historic Moundsville A haunted attraction called the Dungeon of Horrors is also set up for the Halloween season Paranormal groups and enthusiast travel guides consider Moundsville Prison to be one of the most haunted prisons in the United States with ghost stories originating as early as the 1930s Legends include the prison occupying the site of a Native American burial ground Reports include former guards seeing phantom inmates and a shadow man wandering the premises as well as unexplained noises voices and cold spots

The prison has been featured in a variety of books films television shows songs and video games

Moundsville native Davis Grubb has written a couple of novels with Moundsville as the setting Fools Parade also known as Dynamite Man from Glory Jail and The Night of the Hunter The penitentiary was featured as a significant part of each plot

These works by Grubb have been adapted as major motion pictures The Night of the Hunter was adapted into a film by Charles Laughton and James Agee in 1955 It stars Robert Mitchum and Shelley Winters Fools Parade starring James Stewart Kurt Russell and George Kennedy was adapted into a film in 1971

Prison scenes in the 2013 film Out of the Furnace were filmed on site at the penitentiary

The Hulu original series Castle Rock based on Stephen Kings work was filmed here In the series the penitentiary is Shawshank The reason this site was chosen for Shawshank instead of the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield Ohio where the movie Shawshank Redemption was filmed is due to the showrunners desire to make the town around Shawshank more visible

External shots of the penitentiary were used for Season 1 Episode 9 of the Netflix Original Series Mindhunter

The prison appears in the 2018 video game Fallout 76 where it is known as the Eastern Regional Penitentiary

Designer label
The term designer label refers for clothing luxury automobile manufacturers and other personal accessory items sold under an often prestigious marque which is commonly named after a designer founder or location where the company was founded such as BMW The term is most often applied to luxury goods While members of the upper middle class or the mass affluent are perhaps the most commonly targeted customers of these designer labels some marqueessuch as Cartier Rolex Montblanc and the haute couture  tend to a wealthier customer base But almost every designer brand has merchandise that middleclass wouldnt normally be able to afford such as exotic skins furs and hides limited edition pieces or things simply priced higher Designer Label companies use their smaller and cheaper merchandise aimed at the middle class such as wallets fashion jewellery keyrings and small accessories to make the majority of their income whilst the more expensive pieces such as haute couture high jewellery handbags shoes and even furnishings are usually reserved for the wealthier upperclass clientele

A lot of big designer labels focus on haute couture and marketing while licensing the production of their cheaper merchandise to others In the eyewear industry for example brands like Burberry Chanel Armani and Prada license their brand names to market leaders like Luxottica Smaller designer labels such as AJO Studio Brownstone or Nirvan Javan tend to focus on a specific industry and therefore often produce and distribute the products themselves

Many department stores themselves may be considered designer labels such as Neiman Marcus Harrods David Jones and Daimaru

Designer labels are not only restricted to the fashion design industry Many car and motorcycle companies such as Rolls Royce Harley Davidson and Mercedes Benz are regarded as designer labels These companies make their vehicles to a higher standard than the average manufacturers and many other attributes such leather used in the upholstery woodwork and paneling high levels of technology extra safety and speed are employed to make for a better product These vehicles are also in high demand all over the world and waiting lists may be applied to some models such as the Rolls Royce Phantom and the Bugatti Veyron

Many people consider designer labels to be a status symbol

Some research indicates that products with designer labels on them are perceived as higher in quality and fashionability than the same products without designer labels Other studys show evidence that brand names do influence consumers perception of price but not of quality of the products

The relationship between consumer products and social status is highly debated

Bergre
A bergre is an enclosed upholstered French armchair fauteuil with an upholstered back and armrests on upholstered frames The seat frame is overupholstered but the rest of the wooden framing is exposed it may be moulded or carved and of beech painted or gilded or of fruitwood walnut or mahogany with a waxed finish Padded elbowrests may stand upon the armrests A bergre is fitted with a loose but tailored seat cushion It is designed for lounging in comfort with a deeper wider seat than that of a regular fauteuil though the bergres by Bellang in the White House one illustrated are more formal A bergre in the eighteenth century was essentially a meuble courant designed to be moved about to suit convenience rather than being ranged permanently formally along the walls as part of the decor 

The fanciful name shepherdess chair was coined in mideighteenth century Paris where the model developed without a notable break from the lateseventeenth century chaise de commodit a version of the wing chair whose upholstered wings shielding the face from fireplace heat or from draughts were retained in the bergre  oreilles with ears or fancifully bergre confessionale as if the occupant were hidden from view as in a confessional A bergre may have a flat raked back in which case it is  la reine or more usually in Louis XV furnishings it has a coved back en cabriolet A bergre with a low coved back that sweeps without a break into the armrests is a marquise 

Appearing first in Paris during the Rgence 171523 the form reaches its full development in the unifying curves of the rococo style then continues in a more architectural rectilinear style in the Louis XVI Directoire and French and American Empire styles

Adolf Hitlers directives
Adolf Hitler made many hundreds of directives orders and decrees while Fhrer of Nazi Germany many of them related to military policy and the treatment of civilians in occupied countries Many of them are direct evidence of the commission of war crimes such as the notorious Commando Order Other orders provide evidence of crimes against humanity such as the Hitler order establishing forced euthanasia of disabled people in 1939 under Action T4 and the Nacht und Nebel order for eliminating civilian resisters in occupied countries

On 21 October 1938 Hitler issued a new directive to the Wehrmacht to prepare for the following eventualities


In 1939 Hitler issued an order which became the justification for killing disabled children and people in Action T4 It laid the basis for the Holocaust since gassing was a favoured method of murdering the many victims The SS staff who operated the gas chambers were later employed at Auschwitz and many other concentration camps and death camps

On 3 April 1939 the directive for Fall Weiss Case White was ready It was issued on 11 April

The first section written by Hitler began

German relations with Poland continue to be based on the principles of avoiding any disturbances Should Poland however change her policy towards Germany a final settlement might become necessary in spite of the Treaty in force with Poland The aim then will be to destroy Polish military strength and create in the East a situation which satisfies the requirements of National Defence The free state of Danzig will be proclaimed a part of Reich territory by the outbreak of hostilities at the latest The political leaders consider it their task in this case to isolate Poland if possible that is to say to limit the war to Poland only

The Wehrmacht had to be ready to carry out Fall Weiss at any time after 1 September 1939

The notorious Commissar Order Kommissarbefehl dated 6 June 1941 followed directly on the Barbarossa decree It was called Instructions on the Treatment of Political Commissars and began

In the struggle against Bolshevism we must not assume that the enemys conduct will be based on principles of humanity or of international law In particular hateinspired cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners can be expected on the part of all grades of political commissars who are the real leaders of resistanceTo show consideration to these elements during this struggle or to act in accordance with international rules of war is wrong and endangers both our own security and the rapid pacification of conquered territoryPolitical commissars have initiated barbaric Asiatic methods of warfare Consequently they will be dealt with immediately and with maximum severity As a matter of principle they will be shot at once whether captured during operations or otherwise showing resistance

Nacht und Nebel Night and Fog was a directive  of Adolf Hitler on 7 December 1941 that was originally intended to remove all political activists and resistance helpers anyone endangering German security die deutsche Sicherheit gefhrden throughout Nazi Germanys occupied territories The name was a direct reference to a magic spell involving the Tarnhelm stealth helmet from Wagners Rheingold The Tarnhelm could make its wearer invisible and instantly transport him to another location

In February 1942 two months later Armed Forces High Command Feldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel expanded it to include all persons in occupied countries who had been taken into custody and were still alive eight days later The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission by denying friends and families of the missing any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany apparently vanishing without a trace but in fact incarcerated in concentration camps

Fhrer Directive No 46 was issued on 18 August 1942 under the title Instructions For Intensified Action Against Banditry Bandenbekmpfung In The East marking the radicalisation of socalled antipartisan warfare The directive called on the security forces to act with utter brutality to achieve complete extermination of gangs while providing immunity from prosecution for any acts committed during banditfighting operations

The directive designated the SS as the organisation responsible for reararea warfare in areas under civilian administration In areas under military jurisdiction the Army Group Rear Areas the Army High Command had the overall responsibility The directive declared the entire population of bandit ie partisancontrolled territories as enemy combatants In practice this meant that the aims of security warfare was not pacification but complete destruction and depopulation of bandit and banditthreatened territories turning them into dead zones Tote Zonen

The Kommandobefehl Commando Order was issued by Adolf Hitler on 18 October 1942 stating that all Allied commandos encountered by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial even in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit agents and saboteurs not in proper uniforms who fell into the hands of the German military forces by some means other than direct combat through the police in occupied territories for instance were to be handed over immediately to the Sicherheitsdienst SD Security Service The order which was issued in secret made it clear that failure to carry out these orders by any commander or officer would be considered to be an act of negligence punishable under German military law

The Nero Decree was issued by Adolf Hitler on 19 March 1945 ordering the destruction of German infrastructure to prevent their use by Allied forces as they penetrated deep within Germany It was officially titled Demolitions on Reich Territory Decree Befehl betreffend Zerstrungsmanahmen im Reichsgebiet and has subsequently become known as the Nero Decree after the Roman Emperor Nero who supposedly engineered the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD It was countermanded by among others Albert Speer who wanted to preserve as much as possible for Germany following her defeat in 1945

Ilag
Ilag is an abbreviation of the German word Internierungslager They were internment camps established by the German Army in World War II to hold Allied civilians caught in areas that were occupied by the German Army They included United States citizens caught in Europe by surprise when war was declared in December 1941 and citizens of the British Commonwealth caught in areas engulfed by the Blitzkrieg

Amongst the internees were British born citizens who were resident in the Channel Islands In October 1941 Adolf Hitler ordered the internment of 8000 British in retaliation for the internment by the British Army of 800 Germans living in Iran The order was not carried out until it was reissued by Hitler in September 1942 The German commander of the islands based in Jersey was ordered to deport to camps in Germany all British citizens not born in the islands The numbers were reduced with around 2200 men women and children being deported



There were 219 internment camps in France during the Second World War Several Ilags were set up in France by the German Army to hold citizens of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth countries that were caught by the rapid advance during the Battle of France The main camps were

The camp at Besanon was called Frontstalag 142 or Caserne Vauban At the end of 1940 2400 women mostly British were interned in the Vauban barracks and another 500 old and sick in the St Jacques hospital close by In early 1941 many of them were released the rest were transferred to Vittel

The camp was located in the old barracks built in the middle of the 19th century at SaintDenis close to Paris The camp was opened June 1940 and existed until liberated by the United States Army in August 1944 Part of the grounds were surrounded by barbed wire to provide open space for exercise
In early 1942 there were more than 1000 male British internees in the camp The meagre food rations were augmented by the International Red Cross packages so that overall their diet was satisfactory Life was tolerable because there was a good library and recreation was provided by sports activities and theatre

Also called Frontstalag 121 this was one of the more hospitable internment camps as it was located in requisitioned hotels in this spa near Epinal in the Department Vosges Most of the British families and single women were transferred here from St Denis and Besanon

In early 1942 women over 60 men over 75 and children under 16 were released The overall population was thus reduced to about 2400 The inmates included a number of American families and women
Provisions for recreation included a local theatre and a park with seven tennis courts

A young New Zealander and two British women escaped in August 1941 and made their way to England


A camp in  close to Meckenbeuren in Wrttemberg on Lake Constance was opened in 1940 and operated until 1945 It was situated in a castle and four adjacent buildings Originally it had been a mental hospital run by nuns By orders of Hitler about 700 of the patients were exterminated with injections to provide room for internees

The first internees were about 300 British citizens from Poland More British were brought in 1941 from Belgium Greece Netherlands and other countries The food rations were augmented with Red Cross packages The guards were older German veterans of World War I and treated the internees well as several of them had been prisoners of war in British camps and had been treated well In January 1943 many of the married women were transferred to Vittel see above

Built in 1939 as barracks this camp became an Ilag to accommodate Channel Island families and was located on a plateau northwest of Biberach an der Ri in southeastern BadenWrttemberg It consisted of 23 concrete huts which had previously served as Oflag VB for officers who were prisoner of war Initially the camp was administered by the German Army but in spring of 1943 the administration was transferred to the Interior Ministry this caused a worsening of food rations Otherwise the International Red Cross considered conditions in the camp satisfactory 

In January 1943 the camp held 1011 internees 429 men 437 women and 145 children

20 Channel Island civilians died in Biberach

This camp also held Channel Island families It was located in the town of Bad Wurzach and southeastern BadenWrttemberg Earlier it had been used as an oflag housing French officers Conditions were less satisfactory because it was located in a threestory 18thcentury castle that had recently been a monastery and the rooms were dark and damp 618 internees arrived at the end of October 1942 all of them families In late 1944 72 Dutch Jews arrived from BergenBelsen most appeared to have English grandparents The deportees now learned first hand about conditions elsewhere

12 Channel Island civilians died in Wurzach

British and American citizens were interned in Laufen and Tittmoning in Bavaria on the border with Austria In September 1942 British single men from the Channel Islands were sent here where they found some Americans in residence In 1943 the younger men over 16 who had parents in Biberach or Wurzach were moved to Laufen to release space These two camps were always administered by the German Army

Frank Stroobant the camp senior was invited in April 1943 to attend an inspection in the forest of Katyn in Russia where a massacre of 22000 mainly Polish army and police officers by Soviet forces had been uncovered He was the only civilian witness at the event From June 1943 the camp senior became Ambrose Sherwill

Boredom was a major problem some internees were permitted to undertake paid work outside camp The moral view of whether work should be done was strongly debated in the camp but as everyone was an individual it was up to each person to make their own decision

In April 1944 Laufen held 459 British internees 417 Channel Islanders and 120 Americans including Josef Nassy 10 Channel Island internees died in Laufen during internment

International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation
The International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation or ILAC started as a conference in 1977 with the aim of developing international cooperation for facilitating trade by promotion of the acceptance of accredited test and calibration results In 1996 ILAC became a formal cooperation with a charter to establish a network of mutual recognition agreements among accreditation bodies that would fulfil this aim 

The ultimate aim of the ILAC is increased use and acceptance by industry as well as government of the results from accredited laboratories including results from laboratories in other countries In this way the freetrade goal of a product tested once and accepted everywhere can be realised

Wendens Ambo
Wendens Ambo is a village in the Uttlesford district of Essex England The population at the 2011 census was measured at 473 Its unusual name ambo being the Latin for both originates from the merging of two originally separate villages called Wenden Magna or Great Wenden and Wenden Parva or Little Wenden

Wendens Ambo is approximately two miles southwest of the market town of Saffron Walden fifteen miles south of Cambridge and forty miles north of London

Within the village is Audley End railway station which is the main station for Audley End House and Saffron Walden

The earliest signs of settlement are from the Roman period Remains of a villa were found during an excavation in 1853 and finds of flint tools from 300200BC suggest an even earlier settlement

It is likely that the farming community of Wenden probably started around the 6th and 7th centuries taking its name from the valley in which it lies Wendene The Domesday Book contains the first written account of Wenden Magna and Wenden Parva Wenden Magna was owned by Robert Gernon a Frenchman who also had land in Stansted and Takeley Wenden Parva was also owned by a Frenchman William de Warenne The Wendens passed through the Middle Ages as very ordinary English villages with their parish church of St Mary the Virgin located in Wenden Magna A third Wenden higher up the valley to the west is Wenden Lofts probably the Loutes Wenden mentioned in a legal record of 1470 where the nearby villages of Arkysden  Elmedon are also mentioned

During the 17th century work began to rebuild the village dwellings some of which are still occupied today Also at this time on 23 March 1662 Wenden Magna and Wenden Parva were joined to create Wendens Ambo

The 18th and 19th centuries brought the Industrial Revolution and also the railway providing opportunities for work elsewhere leading to Wenden eventually becoming a commuter village

Headsprung
Headsprung is a song by American hip hop artist LL Cool J It was released in June 2004 as the lead single from his eleventh album The DEFinition The song was a success on the charts it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 number 4 on the Hot Rap Songs and number 7 on the Hot RBHipHop Songs

Keri Hilson did a cover of this song featuring Justin Timberlake the cover was used as a remix with LL Cool Js 1st verse A version of this song however without Timberlake has appears renamed as the title track for Hilsons 2009 compilation album Ms Keri

AllMusics David Jeffries praised the song as a change from the slow jams of LLs 10 highlighting the southern production and New York style vocal delivery as a great merger concluding that Simple club crunk and not the kind of revolution Timbaland or LL Cool J can crank out when on fire but solid enough to put the rapper back on top of the beatbox Rashaun Hall of Billboard was mixed on the song commending LLs attempt to adapt to the crunk style but felt the hook was derivative and that Timbalands production overpowered him concluding that For better or for worse Headsprung marks LL Cool Js continued evolution as an artist Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine said that it was a hit but not a monster

WFSUFM
WFSU is the callsign or variations thereon for public radio stations operated by Florida State University in Tallahassee Florida

WFSU also operates 3 radio stations that serve northern Florida


Florida State entered radio on January 21 1949 when WFSU signed on as a studentrun radio station at 660 AM Due to the terms of its license the signal was limited to the confines of the Florida State campus It was on the air for three hours every night during the week with a lineup of campus news interviews music and an occasional play

The station was forced off the air in April 1953 due to complaints that the signal was leaking off campus Florida State applied for a lowpowered FM license and WFSU returned to the air at 915 FM in July 1954 Soon afterward it joined the National Association of Educational Broadcasters allowing it to significantly upgrade its programming with offerings from BBC World Service and Radio France It also began carrying Seminoles football games after no commercial station would carry them

In 1970 WFSUFM became a charter member of NPR and was one of the 90 stations to carry the initial broadcast of All Things Considered In the 1970s it shifted to a format of mostly classical music

The station continued to grow during the 1980s but was somewhat hampered by problems with its signal Unlike most NPR stations of the time it had no backup power source for its transmitter resulting in frequent outages The stations reception was also marginal at best in the northeastern part of the city which is very hilly To solve the problem WFSU won approval for a new station on 889 FM operating from a new tower northeast of Tallahassee All NPR news and information programming moved there on October 14 1990 Classical music remained on 915 which received new call letters WFSQ However due to the legal structure of the changeover the Federal Communications Commission considers WFSQ to be the same station as the old WFSU To improve its coverage on the Georgia side of the market Florida State signed on WFSL in 2003

WFSW signed on in 1996 providing Panama City with a second NPR service alongside Gulf Coast Community Colleges WKGCFM Until WKGC dropped NPR in 2013 Panama City was one of the smallest cities in the country with separate NPR stations

In June 2011 it was revealed that WFSU will receive 28 million in funding for various services related to Florida government This is despite the 48 million of funding to other public radio and television stations vetoed by Governor Rick Scott in May 2011
